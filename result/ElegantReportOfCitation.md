##Citing Sentences: 
**48** :  While an improvement over simple destructive **unification** , Tomabechi 's **approach** still suffers from what **Kogure** ( **Kogure** , 1990 ) calls **redundant** **copying** .

##Citing Sentences: 
**116** :  As it has been noticed by [ Godden 90 ] and [ **Kogure** 90 ] , the **key** **idea** of **avoiding** `` **redundant** **copying** '' is to do **copying** lazily .

**118** :  **Kogure** uses a **revised** **copynode** **procedure** which maintains **copy** **dependency** **information** in **order** to **avoid** immediate **copying** . 

**124** :  Similarly , in **Kogure** 's **approach** , not all **redundant** **copying** is avoided in **cases** where there **exists** a **feature** **path** ( a **sequence** of **nodes** connected by **arcs** ) to a **node** that needs to be **copied** .
