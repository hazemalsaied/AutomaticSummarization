		<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">We consider the problem of question-focused sentence retrieval from complexnews articles describing multi-event stories published over time.</S>
		<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">Annotators generated a list of questions central to understanding each story in our corpus.</S>
		<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Because of the dynamic nature of the stories,many questions are time-sensitive (e.g.“How many victims have been found?”)Judges found sentences providing an answer to each question.</S>
		<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">To address thesentence retrieval problem, we apply astochastic, graph-based method for comparing the relative importance of the textual units, which was previously used successfully for generic summarization.</S>
		<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Currently, we present a topic-sensitive versionof our method and hypothesize that it canoutperform a competitive baseline, whichcompares the similarity of each sentenceto the input question via IDFweightedword overlap.</S>
		<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">In our experiments, themethod achieves a TRDR score that is significantly higher than that of the baseline.</S>
