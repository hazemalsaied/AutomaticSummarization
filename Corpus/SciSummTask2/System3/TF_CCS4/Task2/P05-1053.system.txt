It also shows that our system achieves overall performance of 77.2%/60.7%/68.0 and 63.1%/49.5%/55.5 in precision/recall/F-measure on the 5 ACE relation types and the best-reported systems on the ACE corpus. 
Table 5 separates the performance of relation detection from overall performance on the testing set. 
It only improves the F-measure by 0.8 due to the recall increase. 
Many machine learning methods have been proposed to address this problem, e.g., supervised learning algorithms. 
For the choice of features, we use the full set of features from Zhou et al.. 
we call the features used in Zhou et al. flat feature set. 
Table 2 also measures the contributions of different features by gradually increasing the feature set. 
Feature-based methods  for this task employ a large amount of diverse linguistic features, such as lexical, syntactic and semantic features. 
This paper investigates the incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using SVM. 
This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking.
