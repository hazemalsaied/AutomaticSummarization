We also have begun to ex­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties. 
This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VN lexicon which is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levinâ€™s classification, called Intersective Levin classes. 
We have also examined a mapping between the English verbs that we have discussed and their Portuguese translations, which have sev­ eral of the same properties as the corresponding verbs in English. 
We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses. 
This reorganization which was facilitated by the use of inter- sective Levin classes  refined the classes to account for semantic and syntactic differences within a class 
In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. 
Palmer  argue that syntactic frames and verb classes are useful for developing principled classifications of verbs. 
In computational linguistics, the VerbNet project  bear relation to this work.
