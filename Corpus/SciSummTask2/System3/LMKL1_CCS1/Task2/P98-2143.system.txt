We have also adapted and evaluated the approach for Polish. 
The evaluation for Polish was based technical manuals available on the Internet. 
Mitkov  obtains a success rate of 89.7% for pronominal references, working with English technical manuals. 
The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolv­ ing anaphors. 
In addition, preliminary experiments show that the approach can be success­ fully adapted for other languages with minimum modifications. 
There are many recent approaches to this prob lem, e. g. syntax-based approaches. 
Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge. 
As expected, some of the preferences had to be modified in order to fit with specific features of Polish. 
One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledge­ based system, however, is that it is a very labour­ intensive and time-consuming task. 
We selected for comparative evaluation three approaches extensively cited in the literature: Kennedy and Boguraevâ€™s parser- free version of Lappin and Leassâ€™ RAP. 
We have described a robust, knowledge-poor ap­ proach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger. 
This module resolves third-person personal pronouns and is an adaptation of Mitkovâ€™s robust, knowledge-poor multilingual approach. 
Mitkovâ€™s knowledge-poor pronoun resolution method, for example, uses the scores from a set of antecedent indicators to rank the candidates. 
Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent. 
Indeed, such feature-based methods have been widely applied in parsing.
