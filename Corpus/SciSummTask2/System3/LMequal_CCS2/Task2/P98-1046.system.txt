We also have begun to ex­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties. 
We also plan to experiment with different classification schemes for verb semantics such as WordNet. 
In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. 
This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VN lexicon which is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levinâ€™s classification, called Intersective Levin classes. 
In this experiment, we have tried to choose the Portuguese verb that is most closely related to the description of the English verb in the Levin class. 
We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses. 
We present a refinement of Levin classes, intersec­ tive sets, which are a more fine-grained clas­ sification and have more coherent sets of syn­ tactic frames and associated semantic compo­ nents. 
Palmer  argue that syntactic frames and verb classes are useful for developing principled classifications of verbs.
