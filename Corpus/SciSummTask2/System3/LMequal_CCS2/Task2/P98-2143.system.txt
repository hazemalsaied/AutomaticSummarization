Mitkov  obtains a success rate of 89.7% for pronominal references, working with English technical manuals. 
Evaluation reports a success rate of 89.7% which is better than the suc­ cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data. 
The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolv­ ing anaphors. 
The evaluation for Polish was based technical manuals available on the Internet. 
We have also adapted and evaluated the approach for Polish. 
In addition, preliminary experiments show that the approach can be success­ fully adapted for other languages with minimum modifications. 
Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent. 
Mitkovâ€™s knowledge-poor pronoun resolution method, for example, uses the scores from a set of antecedent indicators to rank the candidates. 
We have described a robust, knowledge-poor ap­ proach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger. 
Our paper discusses a particular configuration of this new evaluation environment incorporating three approaches sharing a common â€knowledge-poor philosophyâ€: Kennedy and Boguraevâ€™s  knowledge-poor approach. 
Our preference-based approach showed clear su­ periority over both baseline models. 
Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge. 
As expected, some of the preferences had to be modified in order to fit with specific features of Polish. 
One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledge­ based system, however, is that it is a very labour­ intensive and time-consuming task.
