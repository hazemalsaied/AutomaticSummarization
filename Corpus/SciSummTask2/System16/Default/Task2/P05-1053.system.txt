It shows that our system achieves the performance of 84.8%/66.7%/74.7 in precision/recall/F- measure on relation detection.
It also shows that our system achieves overall performance of 77.2%/60.7%/68.0 and 63.1%/49.5%/55.5 in precision/recall/F-measure on the 5 ACE relation types and the best-reported systems on the ACE corpus.
The experiment result also shows that our feature-based approach outperforms the tree kernel-based approaches by more than 20 F-measure on the extraction of 5 ACE relation types.

Table 2 measures the performance of our relation extrac tion system over the 43 ACE relation subtypes on the testing set.
Besides, we also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance.
It shows that 73% (627/864) of errors results from relation detection and 27% (237/864) of errors results from relation characterization, among which 17.8% (154/864) of errors are from misclassification across relation types and 9.6% (83/864) # of relations of errors are from misclassification of relation sub- types inside the same relation types.
Two features are defined to include this information: • ET1Country: the entity type of M1 when M2 is a country name • CountryET2: the entity type of M2 when M1 is a country name 5 http://ilk.kub.nl/~sabine/chunklink/ Personal Relative Trigger Word List This is used to differentiate the six personal social relation subtypes in ACE: Parent, Grandparent, Spouse, Sibling, Other-Relative and Other- Personal.
