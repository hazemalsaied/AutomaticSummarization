We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.
After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue.
If the same pair of NE instances is used with different phrases, these phrases are likely to be paraphrases.
Evaluation within a set The evaluation of paraphrases within a set of phrases which share a keyword is illustrated in Figure 4.
For example, the phrase “'s New York-based trust unit,” is not a paraphrase of the other phrases in the “unit” set.
The accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the number of paraphrases to the total number of phrases in the set.
As can be seen in Figure 3, the phrases in the “agree” set include completely different relationships, which are not paraphrases.
Evaluation of links A link between two sets is considered correct if the majority of phrases in both sets have the same meaning, i.e. if the link indicates paraphrase.
Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].
