Word Re-ordering and DP-based Search in Statistical Machine Translation
In this paper, we describe a search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT) based on dynamic programming (DP).
A search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented.
The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language.
In Section 2, we brie y review our approach to statistical machine translation.
In Section 4, we present the performance measures used and give translation results on the Verbmobil task.
In this section, we brie y review our translation approach.
Restrictions: Quasi-monotone Search The above search space is still too large to allow the translation of a medium length input sentence.
Although the ultimate goal of the Verbmobil project is the translation of spoken language, the input used for the translation experiments reported on in this paper is the (more or less) correct orthographic transcription of the spoken sentences.
An error count of 0:0 is assigned to a perfect translation, and an error count of 1:0 is assigned to a semantically and syntactically wrong translation.
For our demonstration system, we typically use the pruning threshold t0 = 5:0 to speed up the search by a factor 5 while allowing for a small degradation in translation accuracy.
In this paper, we have presented a new, e√Ücient DP-based search procedure for statistical machine translation.
