We cluster verbs into lexical semantic classes, using general set of noisy features that capture syntactic and semantic properties of the verbs.
The feature set was previously shown to work well in supervised learning setting, using known English verb classes.
In moving to scenario of verb class discovery, using clustering, we face the problem of having large number of irrelevant features for particular clustering task.
Learning the argument structure properties of verbs—the semantic roles they assign and their mapping to syntactic positions—is both particularly important and difficult.
Computational linguists face lexical acquisition bottleneck, as vast amounts of knowledge about individual words are required for language technologies.
We investigate various approaches to feature selection, using both unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, comparing the results to subsets of features manually chosen according to linguistic properties.
However, the semi- supervised approach (using seed set of sample verbs) overall outperforms not only the full set of features, but the hand-selected features as well.
As such, they serve as means for organizing complex knowledge about verbs in computational lexicon (Kipper et al., 2000).
It is also necessary to consider the probable lack of sophisticated grammars or text processing tools for extracting accurate features.
We have previously shown that broad set of 220 noisy features performs well in supervised verb classification (Joanis and Stevenson, 2003).
We find that the unsupervised method we tried cannot be consistently applied to our data.
However, creating verb classification is highly resource intensive, in terms of both required time and linguistic expertise.
