Supersense tagging assigns unknown nouns one of 26 broad semantic categories used by lexicographers to organise their manual insertion into WORDNET.
The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.
We describe an unsupervised approach, based on vector-space similarity, which does not require annotated examples but significantly outperforms their tagger.
Unfortunately, these resource are extremely time- consuming and labour-intensive to manually develop and maintain, requiring considerable linguistic and domain expertise.
Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only very small degree of overlap.
We also demonstrate the use of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for calculating vector-space semantic similarity.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every sentences in the BLLIP corpus.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.
These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or semiautomatic methods for the creation and maintenance of lexical-semantic resources.
By WORDNET 2.0, coverage has improved but the problem of keeping up with language evolution remains difficult.
For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere (location) is different to exo- sphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers of the earthâ€™s atmosphere.
For the noun hierarchy, there are 25 lex-files and file containing the top level nodes in the hierarchy called Tops.
This approach significantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6
