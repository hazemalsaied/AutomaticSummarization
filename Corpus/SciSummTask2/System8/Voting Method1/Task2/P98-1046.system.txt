Current approaches to English classifica­ tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limita­ tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes.
We have preliminary indications that the membership of our intersective sets will be more compatible with WordNet than the orig­ inal Levin classes.
The only escape from this lim­ itation will be through the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisi­ tion.
In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.
We see verb classes as the key to making gen­ eralizations about regular extensions of mean­ ing.
We present refinement of Levin classes, intersec­ tive sets, which are more fine-grained clas­ sification and have more coherent sets of syn­ tactic frames and associated semantic compo­ nents.
The difficulty of determining suitable lexical representation becomes multi­ plied when more than one language is involved and attempts are made to map between them.
Preliminary investigations have indicated that straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996).
Two current approaches to English verb classi­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).
In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.
