For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match user’s query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the user’s question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.
We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.
If the expression is longer or complicated (like “A buys B” and “A’s purchase of B”), it is called “paraphrase”, i.e. set of phrases which express the same thing or event.
If the expression is word or short phrase (like “corporation” and “company”), it is called “synonym”.
Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task.
Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.
We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.
We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.
Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.
In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from large untagged corpus.
Next, for each pair of NE categories, we collect all the contexts and
