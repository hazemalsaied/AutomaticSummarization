Under the scheme, each character of word is labeled as ‘B’ if it is the first character of multiple-character word, or ‘O’ if the character functions as an independent word, or ‘I’ otherwise.” For example, (whole) (Beijing city)” is labeled as (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/I”.
We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: subword-based tagging and confidence measure approach.
We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with dictionary-based segmentation.
In this work we propose subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.
Taking the same example mentioned above, (whole) (Beijing city)” is labeled as (whole)/O (Beijing)/B (city)/I” in the subword-based tagging, where (Beijing)/B” is labeled as one unit.
By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.
In addition, the latter can be used to balance out-of-vocabulary rates and in-vocabulary rates.
In addition, we found clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach: It yields very low in-vocabulary (IV) rate (R-iv) in return for higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate (R-oov).
Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation
We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.
In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method.
This approach will
