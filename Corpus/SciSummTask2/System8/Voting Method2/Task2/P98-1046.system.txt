In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.
We present refinement of Levin classes, intersec­ tive sets, which are more fine-grained clas­ sification and have more coherent sets of syn­ tactic frames and associated semantic compo­ nents.
Investigating regular sense extensions based on intersective Levin classes
Current approaches to English classifica­ tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limita­ tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes.
We have preliminary indications that the membership of our intersective sets will be more compatible with WordNet than the orig­ inal Levin classes.
We see verb classes as the key to making gen­ eralizations about regular extensions of mean­ ing.
In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.
The only escape from this lim­ itation will be through the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisi­ tion.
The difficulty of determining suitable lexical representation becomes multi­ plied when more than one language is involved and attempts are made to map between them.
Levin verb classes are based on the ability of verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntac­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning pre­ serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).
Preliminary investigations have indicated that straightforward translation of Levin classes into
