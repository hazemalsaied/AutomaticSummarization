What is important and is not expressed by the notation is the so-called coverage constraint: each source position should be 'hit' exactly once by the path of the inverted alignment bI b1:::bi:::bI Using the inverted alignments in the maximum approximation, we obtain as search criterion: max (p(JjI) max eI Yi=1 p(eijei􀀀1 i􀀀2) max bI Yi=1 [p(bijbi􀀀1; I; J) p(fbi jei)])) max (p(JjI) max eI 1;bI Yi=1 p(eijei􀀀1 i􀀀2) p(bijbi􀀀1; I; J) p(fbi jei)])); where the two products over have been merged into single product over i. p(eijei􀀀1 i􀀀2) is the trigram language model probability.
Starting from DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem, we present novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language in order to achieve an eÆcient search algorithm.
The alignment mapping is aj from source position to target position aj The use of this alignment model raises major problems if source word has to be aligned to several target words, e.g. when translating German compound nouns.
The goal of machine translation is the translation of text given in some source language into target language.
In this paper, we describe search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT) based on dynamic programming (DP).
The model is often further restricted so that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word (Brown et al., 1993; Ney et al., 2000).
Pr(eI 1) is the language model of the target language, whereas Pr(fJ jeI1) is the transla tion model.
The experimental tests are carried out on
