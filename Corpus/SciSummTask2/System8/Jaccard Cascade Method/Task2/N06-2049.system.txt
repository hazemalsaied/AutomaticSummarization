Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation
We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.
We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation.
In addition, the latter can be used to balance out-of-vocabulary rates and in-vocabulary rates.
By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.
The character-based “IOB” tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).
Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as ‘B’ if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or ‘O’ if the character functions as an independent word, or ‘I’ otherwise.” For example, ” (whole) (Beijing city)” is labeled as ” (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/I”.
We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.
In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.
If only Chinese characters are used, the subword-based IOB tagging is downgraded into a character-based one.
Taking the same example mentioned above, “ (whole) (Beijing city)” is labeled as ” (whole)/O (Beijing)/B (city)/I” in the subword-based tagging, where ” (Beijing)/B” is labeled as
