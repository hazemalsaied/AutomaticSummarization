Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task.
We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.
We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.
The first stage identifies a keyword in each phrase and joins phrases with the same keyword into sets.
The second stage links sets which involve the same pairs of individual NEs.
A total of 13,976 phrases were grouped.
The accuracy of the sets in representing paraphrase ranged from 73% to 99%, depending on the NE categories and set sizes; the accuracy of the links for two evaluated domains was 73% and 86%.
One of the difficulties in Natural Language Processing is the fact that there are many ways to express the same thing or event.
If the expression is a word or a short phrase (like “corporation” and “company”), it is called a “synonym”.
There has been a lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.
If the expression is longer or complicated (like “A buys B” and “A’s purchase of B”), it is called “paraphrase”, i.e. a set of phrases which express the same thing or event.
Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.
