Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement. (1999). In this paper, we separate the features of base phrase chunking from those of full parsing. Country Name List This is to differentiate the relation subtype ÃḃÂÂROLE.Citizen-OfÃḃÂÂ, which defines the relationship between a person and the country of the personÃḃÂÂs citizenship, from other subtypes, especially ÃḃÂÂROLE.ResidenceÃḃÂÂ, where defines the relationship between a person and the location in which the person lives. Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information contributes to most of the performance inprovement from syntactic aspect while additional full parsing information does not contribute much, largely due to the fact that most of relations defined in ACE corpus are within a very short distance. The ACE corpus is gathered from various newspapers, newswire and broadcasts. ÃḃÂáẁ Chunking features are very useful. Instead of exploring the full parse tree information directly as previous related work, we incorporate the base phrase chunking information performance improvement from syntactic aspect while further incorporation of the parse tree and dependence tree information only slightly improves the performance. For example, we want to determine whether a person is at a location, based on the evidence in the context. This category of features includes: ÃḃÂáẁ #MB: number of other mentions in between ÃḃÂáẁ #WB: number of
