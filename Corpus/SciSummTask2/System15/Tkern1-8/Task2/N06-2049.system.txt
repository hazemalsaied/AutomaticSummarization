For example, inconsistent errors of foreign names can be fixed if alphabetical characters are known. We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation. We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach. We proved the new approach enhanced the word segmentation significantly. The authors appreciate the reviewersÃḃÂÂ effort and good advice for improving the paper. The data contain four corpora from different sources: Academia Sinica (AS), City University of Hong Kong (CITYU), Peking University (PKU) and Microsoft Research in Beijing (MSR). Table 1 shows the performance of the dictionary-based segmentation. Its calculation is defined as: C M(tiob |w) = ÃáẁC Miob (tiob |w) + (1 ÃḃÂÂ Ãáẁ)Ãáṗ(tw , tiob )ng (2) where tiob is the word wÃḃÂÂs IOB tag assigned by the IOB tagging; tw , a prior IOB tag determined by the results of the dictionary-based segmentation. In order to overcome overfitting, a gaussian prior was imposed in the training. If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used. The upper numbers and the lower numbers are of the character-based and the subword-based, respectively A S CI T Y U M SR P K U Ba ke off be st 0. This approach is effective for performing desired segmentation based on usersÃḃÂÂ requirements to R-oov and R-iv.
