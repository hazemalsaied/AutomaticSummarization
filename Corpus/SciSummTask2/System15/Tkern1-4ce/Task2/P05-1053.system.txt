Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement. It also shows that our fea 1 In ACE (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Projects/ACE),. It shows that our system achieves the performance of 84.8%/66.7%/74.7 in precision/recall/F- measure on relation detection. ÃḃÂáẁ PTP: path of phrase labels (removing duplicates) connecting M1 and M2 in the parse tree ÃḃÂáẁ PTPH: path of phrase labels (removing duplicates) connecting M1 and M2 in the parse tree augmented with the head word of the top phrase in the path. Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information contributes to most of the performance inprovement from syntactic aspect while additional full parsing information does not contribute much, largely due to the fact that most of relations defined in ACE corpus are within a very short distance. Country Name List This is to differentiate the relation subtype ÃḃÂÂROLE.Citizen-OfÃḃÂÂ, which defines the relationship between a person and the country of the personÃḃÂÂs citizenship, from other subtypes, especially ÃḃÂÂROLE.ResidenceÃḃÂÂ, where defines the relationship between a person and the location in which the person lives. Instead of exploring the full parse tree information directly as previous related work, we incorporate the base phrase chunking information performance improvement from syntactic aspect while further incorporation of the parse tree and dependence tree information only slightly improves the performance. It shows that our system achieves best performance of 63.1%/49.5%/ 55.5
