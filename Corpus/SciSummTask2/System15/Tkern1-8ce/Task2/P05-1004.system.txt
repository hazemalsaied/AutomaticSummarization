Instead, we use vector-space similarity to retrieve a number of synonyms for each unknown common noun. We describe an unsupervised approach, based on vector-space similarity, which does not require annotated examples but significantly outperforms their tagger. We also demonstrate the use of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for calculating vector-space semantic similarity. Such a corpus is needed to acquire reliable contextual information for the often very rare nouns we are attempting to supersense tag. The supersenses of these synonyms are then combined to determine the supersense. Canonical attributes summarise the key contexts for each headword and are used to improve the efficiency of the similarity comparisons. Once this task is solved successfully, it may be possible to insert words directly into the fine-grained distinctions of the hierarchy itself. There are many parameters to consider: ÃḃÂáẁ how many extracted synonyms to use; ÃḃÂáẁ how to weight each synonymÃḃÂÂs vote; ÃḃÂáẁ whether unreliable synonyms should be filtered out; ÃḃÂáẁ how to deal with polysemous synonyms.
