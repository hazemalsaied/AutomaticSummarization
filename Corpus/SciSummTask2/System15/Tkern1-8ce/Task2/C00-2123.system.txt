However there is no global pruning. The approach assumes that the word reordering is restricted to a few positions in the source sentence. The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task (GermanEnglish, 8000-word vocabulary), which is a limited-domain spoken-language task. The translation direction is from German to English. SSER: subjective sentence error rate: For a more detailed analysis, the translations are judged by a human test person. We are given a source string fJ 1 = f1:::fj :::fJ of length J, which is to be translated into a target string eI 1 = e1:::ei:::eI of length I. Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability: ^eI 1 = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1jfJ 1 )g = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1) Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1)g : (1) The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language. input: source string f1:::fj :::fJ initialization for each cardinality c = 1; 2; ; J do for each pair (C; j), where j 2 C and jCj = c do for each target word e 2 E Qe0 (e; C; j) = p(fj je) max ÃÂ;e00 j02Cnfjg fp(jjj0; J) p(ÃÂ) pÃÂ(eje0; e00) Qe00 (e0;C n fjg; j0)g words fj in the input string of length J. For the final translation each source position is considered exactly once. In this case, we have no finite-state restrictions for the search space. Search t0 CPU time #search mWER
