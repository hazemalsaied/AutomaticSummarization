		<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm which automatically discovers word senses from text.</S>
		<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">The algorithm is based on a graph model representing words and relationships between them.</S>
		<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Sense clusters are iteratively computed by clustering the local graph of similar words around an ambiguous word.</S>
		<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Discrimination against previously extracted sense clusters enables us to discover new senses.</S>
		<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">We use the same data for both recognising and resolving ambiguity.</S>
