		<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">This paper presents a corpus-based approach to word sense disambiguation where a decision tree assigns a sense to an ambiguous word based on the bigrams that occur nearby.</S>
		<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">This approach is evaluated using the sense-tagged corpora from the 1998 SENSEVAL word sense disambiguation exercise.</S>
		<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">It is more accurate than the average results reported for 30 of 36 words, and is more accurate than the best results for 19 of 36 words.</S>
