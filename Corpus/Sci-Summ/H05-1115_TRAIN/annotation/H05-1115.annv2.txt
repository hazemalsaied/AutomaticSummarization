As in LexRank, the set of sentences in a document cluster is represented as a graph, where nodes are sentences and links between the nodes are induced by a similarity relation between the sentences.

The output of our system, a ranked list of sentences relevant to the users question, can be subsequently used as input to an answer selection system in order to find specic answers from the extracted sentences. Alternatively, the sentences can be returned to the user as a question-focused summary ... To apply LexRank, a similarity graph is produced for the sentences in an input document set. In the graph, each node represents a sentence. There are edges between nodes for which the cosine similarity between the respective pair of sentences exceeds a given threshold. The degree of a given node is an indication of how much information the respective sentence has in common with other sentences | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  Kokil Jaidka, NTU |
