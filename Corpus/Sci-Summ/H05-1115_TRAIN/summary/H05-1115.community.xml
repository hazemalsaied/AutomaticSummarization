<S sid ="0">Using Random Walks for Question-focused Sentence Retrieval</S><S sid ="36" ssid = "1">Our goal is to build a question-focused sentence retrieval mechanism using a topic-sensitive version ofthe LexRank method.</S><S sid ="40" ssid = "5">The output of our system, a ranked list of sentences relevant to the userâ€™s question, can be subsequently used as input to an answer selection system in order to find specific answers from the extracted sentences.</S><S sid ="41" ssid = "6">Alternatively, the sentences canbe returned to the user as a question-focused summary.</S><S sid ="46" ssid = "3">To apply LexRank, a similarity graph is producedfor the sentences in an input document set.</S><S sid ="47" ssid = "4">In thegraph, each node represents a sentence.</S><S sid ="48" ssid = "5">There areedges between nodes for which the cosine similarity between the respective pair of sentences exceedsa given threshold.</S><S sid ="49" ssid = "6">The degree of a given node isan indication of how much information the respective sentence has in common with other sentences.</S><S sid ="56" ssid = "13">In topic-sensitive LexRank, we first stem all of thesentences in a set of articles and compute word IDFsby the following formula:</S><S sid ="174" ssid = "2">In a Web-based news summarization setting, users of our system could choose to see the retrieved sentences (asin Table 9) as a question-focused summary.</S>
