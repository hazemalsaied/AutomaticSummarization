    <S sid="3" ssid="3">The other, called ti~e strategic incremental copy graph unification method, uses an early
        failure finding strategy which first tries to unify :;ubstructures tending to fail in unification; this method
        is; based on stochastic data on tim likelihood of failure and ,'educes unnecessary computation.

        newly created structures.

    <S sid="22" ssid="22">This is unnecessary because there are often input snbgraphs that can be used as part of the
        result graph without any modification, or as sharable parts between one of the input graphs and the result
        graph.

    <S sid="142" ssid="3">With such a method, it is possible to delay copying a node until either its own contents need
        to change (e.g., node G3/Ka c !7&gt;) or until it is found to have an arc (sequence) to a node t, hat needs to
        be copied (e.g., node X G3/&lt;a c&gt; in Fig.

        which makes it efficient to keep unification results of substructures of FSs and reuse them.
