			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Despite recent efforts in improving graph unification algorithms, graph unification renlains the most expensive part of parsing, both in time and space.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">ATR&apos;s latest data fi&apos;om the SLTRANS large-scale speech-to-speech translation project ([Morimoto, et al, 1990]) show 80 to 90 percent of tot~ parsing time is still consumed by graph unification where 75 to 95 percent of time is consumed by graph copying fune- ti(ms. 1 Qu~siDestruetive (Q-D) Graph Unification ([Tontabeehi, 1991]) was deveh)ped as a fiLst variation of non-destructive graph unification based upon the notion of time-sensitive &apos;qu~mi-destruction&apos; of node structures.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">The Q-D algorithm was proposed I)~Lsed upon the following m:cepted obserwttion about graph unification: Unification does not always succeed.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Copying is an expensive operation.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">The design of tit(&apos;, Q-D scheme was motiwttcd by the following two princil)les h~r frost gral)h unification ba,sed upon the above observations: • Copying should be performed only for successful unifications.</S>

			<S sid ="217" ssid = "196">3) A parser can lie rood(tied so that it does not (:lit off parts of graphs and use the graphs in their entirety (this should not add emnplexity (mcc strttctttre-sharing is introduced to unification).</S>

			<S sid ="227" ssid = "206">The structure-sharing scltemc introduced ill this paper made the Q-D Mg(~ritlnn run significantly f~mter.</S>
			<S sid ="228" ssid = "207">The original gain of the Q-D algorit, hnt was due to the fact that it does not create ally Over Copies or Early Col&gt;ies whereas iIIcrelllelltal (:opyillg sfllI~Ille inherently produces Early Copies (iLs defined in [Totnal)echi, 19911) when a unification fails.</S>
