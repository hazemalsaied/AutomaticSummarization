			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Graph unification is the most expensive part of unification-based grammar parsing systems.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">For example, in the three types of parsing systems currently used at ATR ], all of which use graph unification algorithms based on [Wroblewski, 1987], unification operations consume 85 to 90 percent of the total cpu time devoted to a parse.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">2 The number of unification operations per sentence tends to grow as the grammar gets larger and more complicated.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">An unavoidable paradox is that when the natural language system gets larger and the coverage of linguistic phenomena increases the writers of natural language grammars tend to rely more on deeper and more complex path equations (cycles and frequent reentrancy) to lessen the complexity of writing the grammar.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">As a result, we have seen that the number of unification operations increases rapidly as the coverage of the grammar grows in contrast to the parsing algorithm itself which does not seem to *Visiting Research Scientist.</S>

			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">2In the large-scale HPSG-based spoken Japanese analysis system developed at ATR, sometimes 98 percent of the elapsed time is devoted to graph unification ([Kogure, 1990]).</S>

			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Thus, it makes sense to speed up the unification operations to improve the total speed performance of the natural language systems.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Our original unification algorithm was based on [Wroblewskl, 1987] which was chosen in 1988 as the then fastest algorithm available for our application (HPSG based unification grammar, three types of parsers (Earley, TomitaLR, and active chart), unification with variables and cycles 3 combined with Kasper&apos;s ([Kasper, 1987]) scheme for handling disjunctions.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">In designing the graph unification algorithm, we have made the following observation which influenced the basic design of the new algorithm described in this paper: Unification does not always succeed.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">As we will see from the data presented in a later section, when our parsing system operates with a relatively small grammar, about 60 percent of the unifications attempted during a successful parse result in failure.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">If a unification falls, any computation performed and memory consumed during the unification is wasted.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">As the grammar size increases, the number of unification failures for each successful parse increases 4.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Without completely rewriting the grammar and the parser, it seems difficult to shift any significant amount of the computational burden to the parser in order to reduce the number of unification failures 5.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Another problem that we would like to address in our design, which seems to be well documented in the existing literature is that: Copying is an expensive operation.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">The copying of a node is a heavy burden to the parsing system.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">[Wroblewski, 1987] calls it a &quot;computational sink&quot;.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">Copying is expensive in two ways: 1) it takes time; 2) it takes space.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Copying takes time and space essentially because the area in the random access memory needs to be dynamically allocated which is an expensive operation.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">[Godden, 1990] calculates the computation time cost of copying to be about 67 per- 3Please refer to [Kogure, 1989] for trivial time modification of Wroblewski&apos;s algorithm to handle cycles.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">4We estimate over 80% of unifications to be failures in our large-scale speech-to-speech translation system under development.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">5Of course, whether that will improve the overall performance is another question.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">cent of the total parsing time in his TIME parsing system.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">This time/space burden of copying is nontrivial when we consider the fact that creation of unnecessary copies will eventually trigger garbage collections more often (in a Lisp environment) which will also slow down the overall performance of the parsing system.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">In general, parsing systems are always short of memory space (such as large LR tables of TomitaLR parsers and expan~ng tables and charts of Farley and active chart parsers&quot;), and the marginal addition or subtraction of the amount of memory space consumed by other parts of the system often has critical effects on the performance of these systems.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">Considering the aforementioned problems, we propose the following principles to be the desirable conditions for a fast graph unification algorithm: • Copying should be performed only for successful unifications.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">• Unification failures should be found as soon as possible.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">By way of definition we would like to categorize excessive copying of dags into Over Copying and Early Copying.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">Our definition of over copying is the same as Wroblewski&apos;s; however, our definition of early copying is slightly different.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "40">• Over Copying: Two dags are created in order to create one new dag.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "41">-This typically happens when copies of two input dags are created prior to a destructive unification operation to build one new dag.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "42">([Godden, 1990] calls such a unification: Eager Unification.).</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "43">When two arcs point to the same node, over copying is often unavoidable with incremental copying schemes.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "44">• Early Copying: Copies are created prior to the failure of unification so that copies created since the beginning of the unification up to the point of failure are wasted.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "45">Wroblewski defines Early Copying as follows: &quot;The argument dags are copied before unification started.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "46">If the unification falls then some of the copying is wasted effort&quot; and restricts early copying to cases that only apply to copies that are created prior to a unification.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "47">Restricting early copying to copies that are made prior to a unification leaves a number of wasted copies that are created during a unification up to the point of failure to be uncovered by either of the above definitions for excessive copying.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "48">We would like Early Copying to mean all copies that are wasted due to a unification failure whether these copies are created before or during the actual unification operations.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "49">Incremental copying has been accepted as an effective method of minimizing over copying and eliminat6For example, our phoneme-based generalized LR parser for speech input is always running on a swapping space be- causethe LR table is too big.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "50">ing early copying as defined by Wroblewski.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "51">However, while being effective in minimizing over copying (it over copies only in some cases of convergent arcs into one node), incremental copying is ineffective in eliminating early copying as we define it.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "52">7 Incremental copying is ineffective in eliminating early copying because when a gra_ph unification algorithm recurses for shared arcs (i.e. the arcs with labels that exist in both input graphs), each created unification operation recursing into each shared arc is independent of other recursive calls into other arcs.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "53">In other words, the recursive calls into shared arcs are non-deterministic and there is no way for one particular recursion into a shared arc to know the result of future recursions into other shared arcs.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "54">Thus even if a particular recursion into one arc succeeds (with minimum over copying and no early copying in Wroblewski&apos;s sense), other arcs may eventually fail and thus the copies that are created in the successful arcs are all wasted.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "55">We consider it a drawback of incremental copying schemes that copies that are incrementally created up to the point of failure get wasted.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "56">This problem will be particularly felt when we consider parallel implementations of incremental copying algorithms.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "57">Because each recursion into shared arcs is non-deterministic,parallel processes can be created to work concurrently on all arcs.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "58">In each of the parallelly created processes for each shared arc, another recursion may take place creating more parallel processes.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "59">While some parallel recursive call into some arc may take time (due to a large number of sub- arcs, etc.) another non-deterministic call to other arcs may proceed deeper and deeper creating a large number of parallel processes.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "60">In the meantime, copies are incrementally created at different depths of subgraphs as long as the subgraphs of each of them are unified successfully.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "61">This way, when a failure is finally detected at some deep location in some subgraph, other numerous processes may have created a large number of copies that are wasted.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "62">Thus, early copying will be a significant problem when we consider the possibility of parallelizing the unification algorithms as well.</S>

			<S sid ="63" ssid = "1">We would like to introduce an algorithm which addresses the criteria for fast unification discussed in the previous sections.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "2">It also handles cycles without over copying (without any additional schemes such as those introduced by [Kogure, 1989]).</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "3">As a data structure, a node is represented with eight fields: type, arc-list, comp-arc-list, forward, copy, comp-arc-mark, forward-mark, and copy-mark.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "4">Although this number may seem high for a graph node data structure, the amount of memory consumed is not significantly different from that consumed by other 7&apos;Early copying&apos; will henceforth be used to refer to early copying as defined by us.</S>

			<S sid ="78" ssid = "16">+ Figure 1: Node and Arc Structures The representation for an arc is no different from that of other unification algorithms.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "17">Each arc has two fields for &apos;label&apos; and &apos;value&apos;.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "18">&apos;Label&apos; is an atomic symbol which labels the arc, and &apos;value&apos; is a pointer to a node.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "19">The central notion of our algorithm is the dependency of the representational content on the global timing clock (or the global counter for the current generation of unification algorithms).</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "20">This scheme was used in [Wroblewski, 1987] to invalidate the copy field of a node after one unification by incrementing a global counter.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "21">This is an extremely cheap operation but has the power to invalidate the copy fields of all nodes in the system simultaneously.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "22">In our algorithm, this dependency of the content of fields on global timing is adopted for arc lists, forwarding pointers, and copy pointers.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "23">Thus any modification made, such as adding forwarding links, copy links or arcs during one top-level unification (unify0) to any node in memory can be invalidated by one increment operation on the global timing counter.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "24">During unification (in unifyl) and copying after a successful unification, the global timing ID for a specific field can be checked by comparing the content of mark fields with the global counter value and if they match then the content is respected; if not it is simply ignored.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "25">Thus the whole operation is a trivial addition to the original destructive unification algorithm (Pereira&apos;s and Wroblewski&apos;s unifyl).</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "26">We have two kinds of arc lists 1) arc-list and comp- arc-list.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "27">Arc-list contains the arcs that are permanent (i.e., usual graph arcs) and compare-list contains arcs that are only valid during one graph unification operation.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "28">We also have two kinds of forwarding links, i.e., permanent and temporary.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "29">A permanent forwarding link is the usual forwarding link found in other algorithms ([Pereira, 1985], [Wroblewski, 1987], etc).</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "30">Temporary forwarding links are links that are only valid during one unification.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "31">The currency of the temporary links is determined by matching the content of the mark field for the links with the global counter and if they match then the content of this field is respected 8.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "32">As in [Pereira, 1985], we have three types of nodes: 1) :atomic, 2) :bottom 9, and 3) :complex.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "33">:atomic type nodes represent atomic symbol values (such as Noun), :bottom type nodes are variables and :complex type nodes are nodes that have arcs coming out of them.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "34">Arcs are stored in the arc-list field.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "35">The atomic value is also stored in the arc-list if the node type is :atomic.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "36">:bottom nodes succeed in unifying with any nodes and the result of unification takes the type and the value of the node that the :bottom node was unified with.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "37">:atomic nodes succeed in unifying with :bottom nodes or :atomic nodes with the same value (stored in the arc-lis0.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "38">Unification of an :atomic node with a :complex node immediately fails.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "39">:complex nodes succeed in unifying with :bottom nodes or with :complex nodes whose subgraphs all unify.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "40">Arc values are always nodes and never symbolic values because the :atomic and :bottom nodes may be pointed to by multiple arcs (just as in structure sharing of :complex nodes) depending on grammar constraints, and we do not want arcs to contain terminal atomic values.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "41">Figure 2 is the central quasi-destructive graph unification algorithm and Figure 3 shows the algorithm for copying nodes and arcs (called by unify0) while respecting the contents of comp-arc-lists.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "42">The functions Complementarcs(dg 1,dg2) and Inter- sectarcs(dgl,dg2) are similar to Wroblewski&apos;s algorithm and return the set-difference (the arcs with labels that exist in dgl but not in rig2) and intersection (the arcs with labels that exist both in dgl and dg2) respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "43">During the set-difference and set- intersection operations, the content of comp-arc-lists are respected as parts of arc lists if the comp-arc- marks match the current value of the global timing counter.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "44">Dereferencedg(dg) recursively traverses the forwarding link to return the forwarded node.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "45">In doing so, it checks the forward-mark of the node and if the forward-mark value is 9 (9 represents a permanent forwarding link) or its value matches the current 8We do not have a separate field for temporary forwarding links; instead, we designate the integer value 9 to represent a permanent forwarding link.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "46">We start incrementing the global counter from 10 so whenever the forward-mark is not 9 the integer value must equal the global counter value to respect the forwarding link.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "47">9Bottom is called leaf in Pereira&apos;s algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "48">value of *unify-global-counter*, then the function returns the forwarded node; otherwise it simply returns the input node.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "49">Forward(dgl, dg2, :forward-type) puts (the pointer to) dg2 in the forward field of dgl.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "50">If the keyword in the function call is :temporary, the current value of the *unify-global-counter* is written in the forward-mark field of dgl.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "51">If the keyword is :permanent, 9 is written in the forward-mark field of dgl.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "52">Our algorithm itself does not require any permanent forwarding; however, the functionality is added because the grammar reader module that reads the path equation specifications into dg feature-structures uses permanent forwarding to merge the additional grammatical specifications into a graph structure 1°.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "53">The temporary forwarding links are necessary to handle reentrancy and cycles.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "54">As soon as unification (at any level of recursion through shared arcs) succeeds, a temporary forwarding link is made from dg2 to dgl (dgl to dg2 if dgl is of type :bottom).</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "55">Thus, during unification, a node already unified by other recursive calls to unifyl within the same unify0 call has a temporary forwarding link from dg2 to dgl (or dgl to dg2).</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "56">As a result, if this node becomes an input argument node, dereferencing the node causes dgl and dg2 to become the same node and unification immediately succeeds.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "57">Thus a subgraph below an already unified node will not be checked more than once even if an argument graph has a cycle.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "58">Also, during copying done subsequently to a successful unification, two ares converging into the same node will not cause over copying simply because if a node already has a copy then the copy is returned.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "59">For example, as a case that may cause over copies in other schemes for dg2 convergent arcs, let us consider the case when the destination node has a corresponding node in dgl and only one of the convergent arcs has a corresponding are in dgl.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "60">This destination node is already temporarily forwarded to the node in dgl (since the unification check was successful prior to copying).</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "61">Once a copy is created for the corresponding dgl node and recorded in the copy field of dgl, every time a convergent arc in dg2 that needs to be copied points to its destination node, dereferencing the node returns the corresponding node in dgl and since a copy of it already exists, this copy is returned.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "62">Thus no duplicate copy is created H. roWe have been using Wroblewski&apos;s algorithm for the unification part of the parser and thus usage of (permanent) forwarding links is adopted by the grammar reader module to convert path equations to graphs.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "63">For example, permanent forwarding is done when a :bottom node is to be merged with other nodes.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "64">nCopying of dg2 ares happens for arcs that exist in dg2 but not in dgl (i.e., Complementarcs(dg2,dgl)).</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "65">Such arcs are pushed to the cornp-arc-list of dgl during unify1 and are copied into the are-list of the copy during subsequent copying.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "66">If there is a cycle or a convergence in arcs in dgl or in ares in dg2 that do not have corresponding arcs in dg 1, then the mechanism is even simpler than the one discussed here.</S>

			<S sid ="158" ssid = "96">The basic control structure of the unification is similar to Pereira&apos;s and Wroblewski&apos;s unifyl.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "97">The essential difference between our unifyl and the previous ones is that our unifyl is non-destructive.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "98">It is because the complementarcs(dg2,dgl) are set to the comp-arc-list of dgl and not into the are-list of dgl.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "99">Thus, as soon as we increment the global counter, the changes made to dgl (i.e., addition of complement arcs into compare-list) vanish.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "100">As long as the comp-arc-mark value matches that of the global counter the content of the comp-arc-list can be considered a part of arc-list and therefore, dgl is the result of unification.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "101">Hence the name quasi-destructive graph unification.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "102">In order to create a copy for subsequent use we only need to make a copy of dgl before we increment the global counter while respecting the content of the comp-arc-list of dgl.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "103">Thus instead of calling other unification functions (such as unify2 of Wroblewski) for incrementally ere- ating a copy node during a unification, we only need to create a copy after unification.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "104">Thus, if unification fails no copies are made at all (as in [Karttunen, 1986]&apos;s scheme).</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "105">Because unification that recurses into shared ares carries no burden of incremental copying (i.e., it simply checks if nodes are compatible), as the depth of unification increases (i.e., the graph gets larger) the speedup of our method should get conspicuous if a unification eventually fails.</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "106">If all unifications during a parse are going to be successful, our algorithm should be as fast as or slightly slower than Wroblewski&apos;s algorithm 19.</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "107">Since a parse that does not fail on a single unification is unrealistic, the gain from our scheme should depend on the amount of unification failures that occur during a unification.</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "108">As the number of failures per parse increases and the graphs that failed get larger, the speedup from our algorithm should become more apparent.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "109">Therefore, the characteristics of our algorithm seem desirable.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "110">In the next section, we will see the actual results of experiments which compare our unification algorithm to Wroblewski&apos;s algorithm (slightly modified to handle variables and cycles that are required by our HPSG based grammar).</S>

			<S sid ="199" ssid = "1">The control structure of our algorithm is identical to that of [Pereira, 1985].</S>

			<S sid ="201" ssid = "3">Because we do not use the environment, the log(d) overhead (where d is the number of nodes in a dag) associated with Pereira&apos;s scheme that is required during node access (to assemble the whole dag from the skeleton and the updates in the environment) is avoided in our scheme.</S>
			<S sid ="202" ssid = "4">We share the principle of storing changes in a restorable way with [Karttunen, 1986]&apos;s reversible unification and copy graphs only after a successful unification.</S>
			<S sid ="203" ssid = "5">Karttunen originally introduced this scheme in order to replace the less efficient structure-sharing implementations ([Pereira, 1985], [Karttunen and Kay, 1985]).</S>
			<S sid ="204" ssid = "6">In Karttunen&apos;s method 21, whenever a destructive change is about to be made, the attribute value pairs 22 stored in the body of the node are saved into an array.</S>

			<S sid ="208" ssid = "10">The difference between Karttunen&apos;s method and ours is that in our algorithm, one increment to the global counter can invalidate all the changes made to nodes, while in Karttunen&apos;s algorithm each node in the entire argument graph that has been destructively modified must be restored separately by retrieving the attribute-values saved in an 21Thediscussion ofKartunnen&apos;s method is based on the D- PATR implementation on Xerox 1100 machines ([Karttunen, 1986]).</S>

			<S sid ="212" ssid = "14">This is not a problem in our method because the temporary change made to a node is performed as pushing pointers into already existing structures (nodes) and it does not require entirely new structures to be created and dynamically allocated memory (which was necessary for the copy (create-node) operation), z3 [Godden, 1990] presents a method of using lazy evaluation in unification which seems to be one SUCC~sful actualization of [Karttunen and Kay, 1985]&apos;s lazy evaluation idea.</S>
			<S sid ="213" ssid = "15">One question about lazy evaluation is that the efficiency of lazy evaluation varies depending upon the particular hardware and programming language environment.</S>
			<S sid ="214" ssid = "16">For example, in CommonLisp, to attain a lazy evalaa_tion, as soon as a function is delayed, a closure (or a structure) needs to be created receiving a dynamic allocation of memory Oust as in creating a copy node).</S>
			<S sid ="215" ssid = "17">Thus, there is a shift of memory and associated computation consumed from making copies to making closures.</S>
			<S sid ="216" ssid = "18">In terms of memory cells saved, although the lazy scheme may reduce the total number of copies created, if we consider the memory consumed to create closures, the saving may be significantly canceled.</S>
			<S sid ="217" ssid = "19">In terms of speed, since delayed evaluation requires additional bookkeeping, how schemes such as the one introduced by [Godden, 1990] would compare with non- lazy incremental copying schemes is an open question.</S>

			<S sid ="222" ssid = "1">The algorithm introduced in this paper runs significantly faster than Wroblewski&apos;s algorithm using Ear- ley&apos;s parser and an HPSG based grammar developed at ATR.</S>
			<S sid ="223" ssid = "2">The gain comes from the fact that our algorithm does not create any over copies or early copies.</S>
			<S sid ="224" ssid = "3">In Wroblewski&apos;s algorithm, although over copies are essentially avoided, early copies (by our definition) are a significant problem because about 60 percent of unifications result in failure in a successful parse in our sample parses.</S>
			<S sid ="225" ssid = "4">The additional set-difference operation required for incremental copying during unify2 may also be contributing to the slower speed of Wroblewski&apos;s algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="226" ssid = "5">Given that our sample grammar is relatively small, we would expect that the difference in the performance between the incremental copying schemes and ours will expand as the grammar size increases and both the number of failures ~ and the size of the wasted subgraphs of failed unifications become larger.</S>
			<S sid ="227" ssid = "6">Since our algorithm is essentially parallel, patallelization is one logical choice to pursue further speedup.</S>
			<S sid ="228" ssid = "7">Parallel processes can be continuously created as unifyl reeurses deeper and deeper without creating any copies by simply looking for a possible failure of the unification (and preparing for successive copying in ease unification succeeds).</S>
			<S sid ="229" ssid = "8">So far, we have completed a preliminary implementation on a shared memory parallel hardware with about 75 percent of effective parallelization rate.</S>
			<S sid ="230" ssid = "9">With the simplicity of our algorithm and the ease of implementing it (compared to both incremental copying schemes and lazy schemes), combined with the demonstrated speed of the algorithm, the algorithm could be a viable alternative to existing unification algorithms used in current ~That is, unless some new scheme for reducing excessive copying is introduced such as scucture-sharing of an unchanged shared-forest ([Kogure, 1990]).</S>
			<S sid ="231" ssid = "10">Even then, our criticism of the cost of delaying evaluation would still be valid.</S>
			<S sid ="232" ssid = "11">Also, although different in methodology from the way suggested by Kogure for Wroblewski&apos;s algorithm, it is possible to at~in structure-sharing of an unchanged forest in our scheme as well.</S>
			<S sid ="233" ssid = "12">We have already developed a preliminary version of such a scheme which is not discussed in this paper.</S>
