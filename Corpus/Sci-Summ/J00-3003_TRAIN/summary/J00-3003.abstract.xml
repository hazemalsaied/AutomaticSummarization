	<S sid ="0">Dialogue Act Modeling for Automatic Tagging and Recognition of Conversational Speech</S>
		<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">We describe a statistical approach for modeling dialogue acts in conversational speech, i.e., speech- act-like units such as STATEMENT, QUESTION, BACKCHANNEL, AGREEMENT, DISAGREEMENT, and APOLOGY.</S>
		<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">Our model detects and predicts dialogue acts based on lexical, collocational, and prosodic cues, as well as on the discourse coherence of the dialogue act sequence.</S>
		<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">The dialogue model is based on treating the discourse structure of a conversation as a hidden Markov model and the individual dialogue acts as observations emanating from the model states.</S>
		<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Constraints on the likely sequence of dialogue acts are modeled via a dialogue act n-gram.</S>
		<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">The statistical dialogue grammar is combined with word n-grams, decision trees, and neural networks modeling the idiosyncratic lexical and prosodic manifestations of each dialogue act.</S>
		<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">We develop a probabilistic integration of speech recognition with dialogue modeling, to improve both speech recognition and dialogue act classification accuracy.</S>
		<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Models are trained and evaluated using a large hand-labeled database of 1,155 conversations from the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous human-to-human telephone speech.</S>
		<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">We achieved good dialogue act labeling accuracy (65% based on errorful, automatically recognized words and prosody, and 71% based on word transcripts, compared to a chance baseline accuracy of 35% and human accuracy of 84%) and a small reduction in word recognition error.</S>
