		<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">The assignment of probabilities to the productions of a context-free grammar may generate an improper distribution: the probability of all finite parse trees is less than one.</S>
		<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">The condition for proper assignment is rather subtle.</S>
		<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Production probabilities can be estimated from parsed or unparsed sentences, and the question arises as to whether or not an estimated system is automatically proper.</S>
		<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">We show here that estimated production probabilities always yield proper distributions.</S>
