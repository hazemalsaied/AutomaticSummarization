			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">In word sense disambiguation, the “first sense” heuristic (choosing the first, or predominant sense of a word) is used by most state-of-the-art systems as a back-off method when information from the context is not sufficient to make a more informed choice.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">In this article, we present an in-depth study of a method for automatically acquiring predominant senses for words from raw text (McCarthy et al. 2004a).</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">The method uses distributionally similar words listed as “nearest neighbors” in automatically acquired thesauruses (e.g., Lin 1998a), and takes advantage of the observation that the more prevalent a sense of a word, the more neighbors will relate to that sense, and the higher their distributional similarity scores will be.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">The senses of a word are defined in a sense inventory.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">We use WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) because this is widely used, is publicly available, and has plenty of gold-standard evaluation data available (Miller et al. 1993; Cotton et al. 2001; Preiss and Yarowsky 2001; Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">The distributional strength of the neighbors is associated with the senses of a word using a measure of semantic similarity which relies on the relationships between word senses, such as hyponyms (available in an inventory such as WordNet) or overlap in the definitions of word senses (available in most dictionaries), or both.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">In this article we provide a detailed discussion and quantitative analysis of the motivation behind the first sense heuristic, and a full description of our method.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">We extend previously reported work in a number of different directions: • We evaluate the method on all parts of speech (PoS) on SemCor (Miller et al. 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Previous experiments (McCarthy et al. 2004c) evaluated only nouns on SemCor, or all PoS but only on the Senseval2 (Cotton et al. 2001) and Senseval3 (Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004) data.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">The evaluation on all PoS is much more extensive because the SemCor corpus is composed of 220,000 words in contrast to the 6 documents in the Senseval2 and -3 English all words data (10,000 words).</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">• We compare two WordNet similarity measures in our evaluation on nouns, and also contrast performance using two publicly available thesauruses, both produced from the same NEWSWIRE corpus, but one derived using a proximity-based approach and the other using dependency relations from a parser.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">It turns out that the results from the proximity-based thesaurus are comparable to those from the dependency based thesaurus; this is encouraging for applying the method to languages without sophisticated analysis tools.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">• We manually analyze a sample of errors from the SemCor evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">A small number of errors can be traced back to inherent shortcomings of our method, but the main source of error is due to noise from related senses.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">This is a common problem for all WSD systems (Ide and Wilks 2006) but one which is only recently starting to be addressed by the WSD community (Navigli, Litkowski, and Hargraves 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">• One motivation for an automatic method for acquiring predominant senses is that there will always be words for which there are insufficient data available in manually sense-tagged resources.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">We compare the performance of our automatic method with the first sense heuristic derived from SemCor on nouns in the Senseval2 data.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">We find that the 554 automatic method outperforms the one obtained from manual annotations in SemCor for nouns with fewer than five occurrences in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">• Aside from the lack of coverage of manually annotated data, there is a need for first sense heuristics to be specific to domain.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">We explore the potential for applying the method with domain-specific text for all PoS in an experiment using a gold-standard domain-specific resource (Magnini and Cavaglia` 2000) which we have used previously only with nouns.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">We show that although there is a little mileage to be had from domain-specific first sense heuristics for verbs, nouns benefit greatly from domain-specific training.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">• In previous work (Koeling, McCarthy, and Carroll 2005) we produced manually sense-annotated domain-specific test corpora for a lexical sample, and demonstrated that predominant senses acquired (from hand-classified corpora) in the same domain as the test data outperformed the SemCor first sense.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">We further this exploration by contrasting with results from training on automatically categorized text from the English Gigaword Corpus and show that the results are comparable to those using hand-classified domain data.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">The article is organized as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "40">In the next section we motivate the use of predominant sense information in WSD systems and the need for acquiring this information automatically.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "41">In Section 3 we give an overview of related work in WSD, focusing on the acquisition of prior sense distributions and domain-specific sense information.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "42">Section 4 describes our acquisition method.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "43">Section 5 describes the experimental setup for the work reported in this article.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "44">Section 6 describes four experiments.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "45">The first evaluates the first sense heuristic using predominant sense information acquired for all PoS on SemCor; for nouns we compare two semantic similarity methods and three different types of distributional thesaurus.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "46">We also report an error analysis for all PoS of our method.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "47">The second experiment compares the performance of the automatic method to the manually produced data in SemCor, on nouns in the Senseval2 data, looking particularly at nouns which have a low frequency in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "48">The third uses corpora in restricted domains and the subject field code gold standard of Magnini and Cavaglia` (2000) to investigate the potential for domain-specific rankings for different PoS.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "49">The fourth compares results when we train and test on domain-specific corpora, where the training data is (1) manually categorized for domain and from the same corpus as the test data, and (2) where the training data is harvested automatically from another corpus which is categorized automatically.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "50">Finally, we conclude (Section 7) and discuss directions for future work (Section 8).</S>

	<SECTION title="Motivation. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "1">The problem of disambiguating the meanings of words in text has received much attention recently, particularly since the inception of the Senseval evaluation exercises (Kilgarriff and Palmer 2000; Preiss and Yarowsky 2001; Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "2">One of the standard Senseval tasks (the “all words” task) is to tag each open class word with one of its senses, as listed in a dictionary or thesaurus such as WordNet (Fellbaum 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "3">The most accurate word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems use supervised machine learning approaches (Stevenson and Wilks 2001), trained on text which has been sense tagged by hand.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "4">However, the performance of these systems is strongly 555 dependent on the quantity of training data available (Yarowsky and Florian 2002), and manually sense-annotated text is extremely costly to produce (Kilgarriff 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "5">The largest all words sense tagged corpus is SemCor, which is 220,000 words taken from 103 passages, each of about 2,000 words, from the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucˇera 1979) and the complete text of a 19th-century American novel, The Red Badge of Courage, which totals 45,600 words (Landes, Leacock, and Tengi 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "6">Approximately half of the words in this corpus are open-class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) and these have been linked to WordNet senses by human taggers using a software interface.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "7">The shortage of training data due to the high costs of tagging texts has motivated research into unsupervised methods for WSD.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "8">But in the English all-words tasks in Senseval2 and Senseval3 (Snyder and Palmer 2004), systems that did not make use of hand-tagged data (in some form or other) performed substantially worse than those that did.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "9">Table 1 summarizes the situation.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "10">It gives the precision and recall of the best1 two supervised (S) and unsupervised (U)2 systems for the English all words and English lexical sample for Senseval23 and -3, along with the first sense baseline (FS) reported by the task organizers.4 This is a simple application of the “first sense” heuristic—that is, using the most common sense of a word for every instance of it in the test corpus, regardless of context.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "11">Although contextual WSD is of course preferable, the baseline is a very powerful one and unsupervised systems find it surprisingly hard to beat (indeed, some of the systems that report themselves as unsupervised actually make some use of a manually obtained first-sense heuristic).</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "12">Considering both precision and recall, only 5 of 26 systems in the Senseval3 English all-words task beat the first sense heuristic as derived from SemCor (61.5%5 ), and then by only a few percentage points (the top system scoring 65% precision and recall) despite using hand-tagged training data available from SemCor and previous Senseval data sets, large sets of contextual features, and sophisticated machine learning algorithms.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "13">The performance of WSD systems, at least for all-words tasks, seems to have plateaued at a level just above the first sense heuristic (Snyder and Palmer 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "14">This is due to the shortage of training data and the often fine granularity of sense distinctions.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "15">Ide and Wilks (2006) argue that it is best to concentrate effort on distinctions which are useful for applications and where systems can be confident of high precision.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "16">In cases where systems are less confident, but word senses, rather than words, are needed, the first sense heuristic is a powerful back-off strategy.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "17">This strategy is dependent on information provided in dictionaries.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "18">Two dictionaries that have been used by English WSD systems are the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter 1 We rank the systems by the recall scores, because this is the accuracy over the entire test set regardless of.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "19">how many items were attempted.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "20">2 Note that the classification of systems as unsupervised is not straightforward.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "21">Systems reported as.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "22">unsupervised in the Senseval proceedings sometimes make use of some manual annotations.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "23">For example, the top scoring system that reported itself unsupervised in the Senseval3 lexical sample task used manually sense-tagged training data for constructing glosses.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "24">3 The verb lexical sample was done as a separate exercise for Senseval2, and for brevity we have not.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "25">included the results from this task.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "26">4 The all-words task organizers used the first sense as listed in WordNet.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "27">This is based on the SemCor first.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "28">sense because WordNet senses are ordered according to the frequency data in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "29">However, where senses are not found in WordNet, the ordering is arbitrarily determined as a function of the “grind” program (see http://wordnet.princeton.edu/man/grind.1WN.htm).</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "30">The lexical sample task organizers state that they use the “most frequent sense” but do not stipulate if this is taken from WordNet, or directly from SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "31">5 This figure is the arithmetic mean of two published estimates (Snyder and Palmer 2004), the difference.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "32">being due to the treatment of multiwords.</S>

			<S sid ="85" ssid = "35">These both provide a ranking of senses according to their predominance.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "36">The sense ordering in LDOCE is based on lexicographer intuition, whereas in WordNet the senses are ordered according to their frequency in SemCor (Miller et al. 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "37">There are two major problems with deriving a first sense heuristic from these types of resources.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "38">The first is that the predominant sense of a word varies according to the source of the document (McCarthy and Carroll 2003) and with the domain.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "39">For example, the first sense of star as derived from SemCor is celestial body, but if one were disambiguating popular news stories then celebrity would be more likely.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "40">Domain, topic, and genre are important in WSD (Martinez and Agirre 2000; Magnini et al. 2002) and the sense-frequency distributions of words depend on all of these factors.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "41">Any dictionary will provide only a single sense ranking, whether this is derived from sense- tagged data as in WordNet, lexicographer intuition as in LDOCE, or inspection of corpus data as in the Oxford Advanced Learner ’s Dictionary (Hornby 1989).</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "42">A fixed order of senses may not reflect the data that an NLP system is dealing with.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "43">The second problem with obtaining predominant sense information applies to the use of hand-tagged resources, such as SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "44">Such resources are relatively small due to the cost of manual tagging (Kilgarriff 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "45">Many words will simply not be covered, or occur only a few times.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "46">For many words in WordNet the ordering of word senses is based on a very small number of occurrences in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "47">For example, the first sense of tiger is an audacious person whereas most people would assume the carnivorous animal sense is more prevalent.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "48">This is because the two senses each occur exactly once in SemCor, and when there is no frequency information to break the tie the WordNet sense ordering is assigned arbitrarily.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "49">There are many fairly common words (such as the noun crane) which do not occur at all in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "50">Table 2 gives the number and percentage of words6 in WordNet and the BNC which do not occur in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "51">As one would expect from Zipf’s law, a substantial number of words do not occur in SemCor, even when we do not consider multiwords.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "52">Many of these words are extremely rare, but 6 Here and elsewhere in this article we give figures only for words without embedded spaces, that is, not.</S>

			<S sid ="188" ssid = "31">Magnini and Cavaglia` (2000) associated WordNet word senses with particular domains, and this has proved useful for high precision WSD (Magnini et al. 2001); indeed, we have used their domain labels (or subject field codes, SFCs) for evaluation (Section 6.3).</S>
			<S sid ="189" ssid = "32">Identification of these SFCs for word senses was semiautomatic and required a considerable amount of hand-labeling.</S>

			<S sid ="197" ssid = "40">Although unsupervised models seem to be beaten whenever there is training data to be had, we anticipate that unsupervised models with improved priors from the ranking might outperform supervised systems in situations where there is little training data available.</S>
			<S sid ="198" ssid = "41">Whereas this article is about finding predominant senses for back-off in a WSD system, the method could be applied to finding a prior distribution over all word senses of each target word.</S>
			<S sid ="199" ssid = "42">It is our intention that the back-off models produced by our prevalence ranking, either as predominant senses or prior distributions over word senses, could be combined with contextual information for WSD.</S>
			<S sid ="200" ssid = "43">Mohammad and Hirst (2006) describe an approach to acquiring predominant senses from corpora which makes use of the category information in the Macquarie Thesaurus.</S>
			<S sid ="201" ssid = "44">Evaluation is performed on an artificially constructed test set from unambiguous words in the same category as the 27 test words (nouns, verbs, and adjectives).</S>
			<S sid ="202" ssid = "45">The senses of the words are the categories of the thesaurus and the experiment uses only two senses of each word, the two most predominant ones.</S>
			<S sid ="203" ssid = "46">The predominance of the two senses is altered systematically.</S>
			<S sid ="204" ssid = "47">The results are encouraging because a much smaller amount of corpus data is needed compared to our approach.</S>
			<S sid ="205" ssid = "48">However, their method has only been applied to an artificially constructed test set, rather than a publicly available corpus, and has yet to be applied in a domain-specific setting, which is the chief motivation of our work.</S>
			<S sid ="206" ssid = "49">The work of Pantel and Lin (2002) is probably the most closely related study that predates ours, although their ultimate goal is different.</S>
			<S sid ="207" ssid = "50">Pantel and Lin devised a method called CBC (clustering by committee) where the 10 nearest neighbors of a word in a distributional thesaurus are clustered to identify the various senses of the word.</S>
			<S sid ="208" ssid = "51">Pantel and Lin use a measure of semantic similarity (Lin 1997) to evaluate the discovered classes with respect to WordNet as a gold standard.</S>
			<S sid ="209" ssid = "52">The CBC method obtained a precision of 61% (the percentage of senses discovered that did exist in WordNet) and a recall of 51% (the percentage of senses discovered from the union of those discovered with different clustering algorithms that they tried).8 8 The calculation of recall was over the union of senses discovered automatically, rather than over the.</S>
			<S sid ="210" ssid = "53">senses in WordNet, because senses in WordNet may be unattested in the data.</S>
			<S sid ="211" ssid = "54">561 Pantel and Lin’s approach is related to ours in that, in their sense discovery procedure, predominant senses have more of a chance of being found than other senses, although their algorithm is specifically tailored to look for senses regardless of frequency.</S>
			<S sid ="212" ssid = "55">To do this the algorithm removes neighbors of the target word once they are assigned to a cluster so that less frequent senses can be discovered.</S>
			<S sid ="213" ssid = "56">Our method, described in detail in Section 4, associates the nearest neighbors to the senses of the target in a predefined inventory (we use WordNet).</S>
			<S sid ="214" ssid = "57">We rank the senses using a measure which sums over the distributional similarity of neighbors weighted by the strength of the association between the neighbors and the sense.</S>
			<S sid ="215" ssid = "58">This is done on the assumption that more prevalent senses will have strong associations with more nearest neighbors because they have occurred in more contexts in the corpus used for producing the thesaurus.</S>
			<S sid ="216" ssid = "59">Both the number and the distributional similarity of the neighbors are used in our prevalence ranking measure.</S>
			<S sid ="217" ssid = "60">Pantel and Lin process the possible clusters in order of their average distributional similarity and number of neighbors but do not take the number of neighbors into account in the scores given for the clusters.</S>
			<S sid ="218" ssid = "61">The measures that Pantel and Lin associate with their clusters are determined by the cohesiveness of the cluster with the target word because their aim is one of sense discovery.</S>
			<S sid ="219" ssid = "62">Their measure is the similarity between the cluster and the target word and does not retain the distributional similarity of the neighbors within the cluster.</S>
			<S sid ="220" ssid = "63">It is quite possible that there is a low frequency sense of a target word with synonyms that form a nice cohesive group.</S>
			<S sid ="221" ssid = "64">Although the number of neighbors assigned to a cluster may correlate with our ranking score, intuition suggests that a combination of the quantity and distributional similarity of neighbors to the target word sense is best for determining the relative predominance of senses.</S>
			<S sid ="222" ssid = "65">In Section 6 we test this hypothesis using a simplified version of our method which only uses the number of neighbors, and assigns each to one sense.</S>
			<S sid ="223" ssid = "66">Comparisons with the CBC algorithm as it stands would be difficult because in order to evaluate acquisition of predominance information we have used publicly available gold-standard sense-tagged corpora, and these have WordNet senses.</S>
			<S sid ="224" ssid = "67">CBC will not always find WordNet senses.</S>
			<S sid ="225" ssid = "68">For example, using the online demonstration of CBC,9 several common senses from nouns from the Senseval2 lexical sample are not discovered, including the upright object sense of post, the block of something sense of bar, the daytime sense of day and the meaning of the word sense of the word sense.</S>
			<S sid ="226" ssid = "69">Automatic acquisition of sense inventories is an important endeavor, and we hope to look at ways of combining our method for detecting predominance with automatically induced inventories such as those produced by CBC.</S>
			<S sid ="227" ssid = "70">Evaluation of induced inventories should be done in the context of an application, because the senses will be keyed to the acquisition corpus and not to WordNet.</S>
			<S sid ="228" ssid = "71">Induction of senses allows coverage of senses appearing in the data that are not present in a predefined inventory.</S>
			<S sid ="229" ssid = "72">Although we could adapt our method for use with an automatically induced inventory, our method which uses WordNet might also be combined with one that can automatically find new senses from text and then relate these to WordNet synsets, as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) and Curran (2005) do with unknown nouns.</S>

			<S sid ="234" ssid = "2">The senses come from a predefined inventory (which might be a dictionary or WordNet-like resource).</S>
			<S sid ="235" ssid = "3">The ranking is derived using a distributional thesaurus automatically produced from a large corpus, and a semantic similarity measure defined over the sense inventory.</S>

			<S sid ="239" ssid = "7">For example, the nearest10 neighbors of sandwich might be: salad, pizza, bread, soup... and the nearest neighbors of the polysemous noun star11 might be: actor, footballer, planet, circle...</S>
			<S sid ="240" ssid = "8">These neighbors reflect the various senses of the word, which for star might be: • a celebrity • a celestial body • a shape • a sign of the zodiac12 We assume that the number and distributional similarity scores of neighbors pertaining to a given sense of a target word will reflect the prevalence of that sense in the corpus from which the thesaurus was derived.</S>
			<S sid ="241" ssid = "9">This is because the more prevalent senses of the word will appear more frequently and in more contexts than other, less prevalent senses.</S>
			<S sid ="242" ssid = "10">The neighbors of the target word relate to its senses, but are themselves word forms rather than senses.</S>
			<S sid ="243" ssid = "11">The senses of the target word are predefined in a sense inventory and we use a semantic similarity score defined over the sense inventory to relate the neighbors to the various senses of the target word.</S>
			<S sid ="244" ssid = "12">The two semantic similarity scores that we use in this article are implemented in the WordNet similarity package.</S>
			<S sid ="245" ssid = "13">One uses the overlap in definitions of word senses, based on Lesk (1986), and the other uses a combination of corpus statistics and the WordNet hyponym hierarchy, based on Jiang and Conrath (1997).</S>

			<S sid ="258" ssid = "26">For example, in the thesaurus we describe subsequently in Section 4.1 acquired from the BNC, chicken has neighbors duck and goose which relate to both the meat and animal senses.</S>

			<S sid ="260" ssid = "28">We normalize the semantic similarity scores because some of the semantic similarity scores that we use, described in Section 4.2, can get disproportionately large.</S>
			<S sid ="261" ssid = "29">Because we normalize the semantic similarity scores, the sum of the ranking scores for a word equals the sum of the distributional similarity scores.</S>

			<S sid ="273" ssid = "41">Measures of distributional similarity take into account the shared contexts of the two words.</S>
			<S sid ="274" ssid = "42">Several measures of distributional similarity have been described in the literature.</S>
			<S sid ="275" ssid = "43">In our experiments, dss is computed using Lin’s similarity measure (Lin 1998a).</S>
			<S sid ="276" ssid = "44">We set the number of nearest neighbors to equal 50.14 We use three different sources of data for our first two experiments, resulting in three distributional thesauruses.</S>
			<S sid ="277" ssid = "45">These are described in the next section.</S>
			<S sid ="278" ssid = "46">We use domain-specific data for our third and fourth experiments.</S>
			<S sid ="279" ssid = "47">The data sources for these are described in Sections 6.3 and 6.4.</S>
			<S sid ="280" ssid = "48">A word, w, is described by a set of features, f , each with an associated frequency, where each feature is a pair (r, x) consisting of a grammatical relation name and the other word in the relation.</S>
			<S sid ="281" ssid = "49">We computed distributional similarity scores for every pair of words of the same PoS where each word’s total feature frequency was at least 10.</S>
			<S sid ="282" ssid = "50">A thesaurus entry of size k for a target word w is then defined as the k most similar words to w. A large number of distributional similarity measures have been proposed in the literature (see Weeds 2003 for a review) and comparing them is outside the scope of this work.</S>
			<S sid ="283" ssid = "51">However, the study of Weeds and Weir (2005) provides interesting insights into what makes a “good” distributional similarity measure in the contexts of semantic similarity prediction and language modeling.</S>
			<S sid ="284" ssid = "52">In particular, weighting features by pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks 1989) appears to be beneficial.</S>
			<S sid ="285" ssid = "53">The pointwise mutual information (I(w, f )) between a word and a feature is calculated as I(w, f ) = log P( f |w) P( f ) (3) Intuitively, this means that the occurrence of a less-common feature is more important in describing a word than a more-common feature.</S>
			<S sid ="286" ssid = "54">For example, the verb eat is more selective and tells us more about the meaning of its arguments than the verb be.</S>
			<S sid ="287" ssid = "55">13 We use sss for the semantic similarity between a WordNet sense and another word, the neighbor.</S>
			<S sid ="288" ssid = "56">We use.</S>
			<S sid ="289" ssid = "57">ssst for the semantic similarity between two WordNet senses, si and a sense of the neighbor (sx ).</S>
			<S sid ="290" ssid = "58">14 From previous work (McCarthy et al. 2004b), the value of k has a minimal effect on finding the.</S>
			<S sid ="291" ssid = "59">predominant sense; however, we will continue experimentation with this in the future for using our ranking score for estimating probability distributions of senses, because a sufficiently large value of k will be needed to include neighbors for rarer senses.</S>
			<S sid ="292" ssid = "60">565 We chose to use the distributional similarity score described by Lin (1998a) because it is an unparameterized measure which uses pointwise mutual information to weight features and which has been shown (Weeds 2003) to be highly competitive in making predictions of semantic similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="293" ssid = "61">This measure is based on Lin’s information-theoretic similarity theorem (Lin 1997): The similarity between A and B is measured by the ratio between the amount of information needed to state the commonality of A and B and the information needed to fully describe what A and B are.</S>
			<S sid ="294" ssid = "62">In our application, if T(w) is the set of features f such that I(w, f ) is positive, then the similarity between two words, w and n, is &apos;Sf ∈T(w)∩T(n) I(w, f ) + I(n, f )1 dss(w, n) = f ∈T(w) I(w, f ) + &apos;Sf ∈T(n) I(n, f ) (4) However, due to this choice of dss and the openness of the domain, we restrict ourselves to only considering words with a total feature frequency of at least 10.</S>
			<S sid ="295" ssid = "63">Weeds et al.</S>
			<S sid ="296" ssid = "64">(2005) do show that distributional similarity can be computed for lower frequency words but this is using a highly specialized corpus of 400,000 words from the biomedical domain.</S>
			<S sid ="297" ssid = "65">Further, it has been shown (Weeds et al. 2005; Weeds and Weir 2005) that performance of Lin’s distributional similarity score decreases more significantly than other measures for low frequency nouns.</S>

			<S sid ="301" ssid = "69">Several semantic similarity scores have been proposed that leverage the structure of WordNet; for ssst we experiment with two of these, as implemented in the WordNet Similarity Package (Patwardhan and Pedersen 2003).</S>

			<S sid ="306" ssid = "74">We briefly summarize them here; Patwardhan, Banerjee, and Pedersen (2003) give a more detailed discussion.</S>
			<S sid ="307" ssid = "75">The scores measure the similarity between two WordNet senses (s1 and s2).</S>
			<S sid ="308" ssid = "76">lesk This measure (Banerjee and Pedersen 2002) maximizes the number of overlapping words in the gloss, or definition, of the senses.</S>
			<S sid ="309" ssid = "77">It uses the glosses of semantically related (according to WordNet) senses too.</S>
			<S sid ="310" ssid = "78">We use the default version of the measure in the package with no normalizing for gloss length, and the default set of relations: lesk(s1, s2) = |{W1 ∈ definition(s1)}| ∩ |{W2 ∈ definition(s2)}| (5) where definitions(s) is the gloss definition of sense s concatenated with the gloss definitions of the senses related to s where the relationships are defined by the de 566 fault set of relations in the relations.dat file supplied with the WordNet Similarity package.</S>
			<S sid ="311" ssid = "79">W ∈ definition(s) is the set of words from the concatenated definitions.</S>
			<S sid ="312" ssid = "80">jcn This measure (Jiang and Conrath 1997) uses corpus data to populate classes (synsets) in the WordNet hierarchy with frequency counts.</S>
			<S sid ="313" ssid = "81">Each synset is incremented with the frequency counts (from the corpus) of all words belonging to that synset, directly or via the hyponymy relation.</S>
			<S sid ="314" ssid = "82">The frequency data is used to calculate the “information content” (IC; Resnik 1995) of a class as follows: IC(s) = −log(p(s)) (6) Jiang and Conrath specify a distance measure: Djcn (s1, s2) = IC(s1) + IC(s2) − 2 × IC(s3) (7) where the third class (s3) is the most informative, or most specific, superordinate synset of the two senses s1 and s2.</S>
			<S sid ="315" ssid = "83">This is converted to a similarity measure in the WordNet Similarity package by taking the reciprocal as in Equation (8) (which follows).</S>
			<S sid ="316" ssid = "84">For this reason, the jcn values can get very large indeed when the distances are negligible, for example where the neighbor has a sense which is a synonym.</S>
			<S sid ="317" ssid = "85">This is a motivation for our normalizing the sss in Equation (1).</S>
			<S sid ="318" ssid = "86">jcn(s1, s2) = 1/Djcn (s1, s2) (8) The IC data required for the jcn measure can be acquired automatically from raw text.</S>
			<S sid ="319" ssid = "87">We used raw data from the BNC to create the IC files.</S>
			<S sid ="320" ssid = "88">There are various parameters that can be set in the WordNet Similarity Package when creating these files; we used the RESNIK method of counting frequencies in WordNet (Resnik 1995), the stop words provided with the package, and no smoothing.</S>
			<S sid ="321" ssid = "89">The lesk score is applicable to all parts of speech, whereas the jcn is applicable only to nouns and verbs because it relies on IC counts which are obtained using the hyponym links and these only exist for nouns and verbs.15 However, we did not use jcn for verbs because in previous experiments (McCarthy et al. 2004c) the lesk measure outperformed jcn because the structure of the hyponym hierarchy is very shallow for verbs and the measure is therefore considerably less informative for verbs than it is for nouns.</S>
			<S sid ="322" ssid = "90">4.3 An Example.</S>
			<S sid ="323" ssid = "91">We illustrate the application of our measure with an example.</S>
			<S sid ="324" ssid = "92">For star, if we set16 k = 4 and have the dss for the previously given neighbors as in the first row of Table 6, and 15 For verbs these pointers actually encode troponymy, which is a particular kind of entailment relation,.</S>
			<S sid ="325" ssid = "93">rather than hyponymy.</S>
			<S sid ="326" ssid = "94">16 In this example, as before, we set k to 4 for the sake of brevity..</S>

			<S sid ="351" ssid = "1">In this section we describe four experiments using our method for acquiring predominant sense information.</S>
			<S sid ="352" ssid = "2">The first experiment evaluates automatically acquired predominant senses for all parts of speech, using SemCor as the test corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="353" ssid = "3">This extends previous work which had only evaluated all PoS on Senseval2 (Cotton et al. 2001) and Senseval3 (Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004) data.</S>
			<S sid ="354" ssid = "4">The SemCor corpus is composed of 220,000 words, in contrast to the 6 documents in the Senseval2 and -3 English all-words data (10,000 words).</S>
			<S sid ="355" ssid = "5">We examine the effects of using the two different semantic similarity scores that performed well in previous work: jcn is quick to compute but lesk has the advantage that it is applicable to all PoS and can be implemented for any dictionary with sense definitions.</S>
			<S sid ="356" ssid = "6">We compare three thesauruses: one is derived from the BNC and two from the NEWSWIRE corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="357" ssid = "7">The two from the NEWSWIRE corpus examine the requirement for a parser by contrasting results obtained when the thesaurus is built using parsed data compared to a proximity approach.</S>
			<S sid ="358" ssid = "8">We contrast the results of the BNC thesaurus with a simplified version of the prevalence score which uses the number of the k neighbors closest to a sense for ranking without using the dss and without sharing the credit for a neighbor between senses.</S>
			<S sid ="359" ssid = "9">We also perform an error analysis on a random sample of words for which a predominant sense was found that differed from that given by SemCor, identifying and giving an indication of the frequencies of the main sources of error.</S>
			<S sid ="360" ssid = "10">The second experiment is on nouns in the Senseval2 all-words data, again using predominant senses acquired using each of the three distributional thesauruses, but in this experiment we explore the benefits of an automatic first sense heuristic when there is inadequate data in available resources.</S>
			<S sid ="361" ssid = "11">Although McCarthy et al.</S>
			<S sid ="362" ssid = "12">(2004c) show that on Senseval2 and Senseval3 test data a first sense heuristic derived from SemCor outperforms the automatic method, we look at whether the method’s performance is relatively stronger on words for which there is little data in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="363" ssid = "13">This is important because, as we have shown in Table 5, low frequency words are used often in senses other than the sense that is ranked first according to SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="364" ssid = "14">In addition to the issue of lack of coverage of manually annotated resources, sense frequency will depend on the domain of the data.</S>
			<S sid ="365" ssid = "15">In the third experiment, we revisit some previous work on noun senses and domain (McCarthy et al. 2004a) using corpora of news text about sports and finance.</S>
			<S sid ="366" ssid = "16">Using distributional thesauruses computed from these corpora and a gold standard domain labeling of word senses we look at the potential for computing domain-specific predominant senses for parts of speech other than nouns.</S>
			<S sid ="367" ssid = "17">Continuing the line of research on automatic acquisition of domain-specific predominant senses, the fourth experiment compares results when we train and test on domain-specific corpora, where the training data is (1) manually categorized for domain and from the same corpus as the gold-standard test data, and (2) where the training data is harvested automatically from another corpus which is categorized automatically.</S>
			<S sid ="368" ssid = "18">6.1 Experiment 1: All Parts of Speech.</S>
			<S sid ="369" ssid = "19">In this experiment, we evaluate the accuracy of automatically acquired predominant senses for all open class parts of speech, taking SemCor as the gold standard.</S>
			<S sid ="370" ssid = "20">For nouns we use the semantic similarity measures lesk and jcn, and for other parts of speech, lesk.</S>
			<S sid ="371" ssid = "21">We use the three distributional thesauruses BNC, DEP, and PROX.</S>
			<S sid ="372" ssid = "22">570 The gold standard is derived from the Brown Corpus files publicly released as part of SemCor, rather than the processed data provided in the cntlist file in the WordNet distribution.</S>
			<S sid ="373" ssid = "23">The released SemCor files contain only the tagged data from the Brown Corpus and do not include data from The Red Badge of Courage.</S>
			<S sid ="374" ssid = "24">We use the released data rather than that in cntlist because this includes the actual tagged examples which are marked for genre by the Brown files.</S>
			<S sid ="375" ssid = "25">We envisage the possibility of further experiments with these genre markers.</S>
			<S sid ="376" ssid = "26">We only evaluate on instances where a single, unique sense is supplied by the annotators.</S>
			<S sid ="377" ssid = "27">So, for example, we ignore instances like the following with multiple wnsn values: &lt;wf cmd=done pos=NN lemma=tooth wnsn=3;1 lexsn=1:05:02::;1:08:00::&gt;tooth&lt;/wf&gt; We also only evaluate on polysemous words (according to WordNet) having one sense in SemCor which is more frequent than any other, and for which both SemCor and our thesauruses have at least a minimal amount of data.</S>
			<S sid ="378" ssid = "28">Specifically, a word must occur three or more times in SemCor; it must also occur in ten or more grammatical relations in the parsed version of the BNC and have neighbors in the distributional thesaurus, or be present in Dekang Lin’s thesaurus.19 We evaluate on nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs separately, computing a number of accuracy measures, both type-based and token-based.</S>
			<S sid ="379" ssid = "29">PSacc is calculated over word types in SemCor which have one sense which occurs more than any other.</S>
			<S sid ="380" ssid = "30">It is the accuracy of identifying the predominant sense in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="381" ssid = "31">If the automatic ranking has a tie for the top ranked sense then we score that word as incorrect.20 So we have PS = |correcttyp | |typesmf | × 100 (9) where typesmf are the types in SemCor such that one sense is more frequent than any other, the word has occurred at least three times in SemCor and has an entry in the thesaurus.</S>
			<S sid ="382" ssid = "32">|correcttyp | is the number of these where the automatically acquired predominant sense matches the first sense in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="383" ssid = "33">PSacc BL is the predominant sense random baseline, obtained as follows: PSacc BL = &apos;S 1 ∈ mf |senses(w)| |typesmf | × 100 (10) WSDsc is a token-based measure.</S>
			<S sid ="384" ssid = "34">It is the WSD accuracy that would be obtained by using the first sense heuristic with the automatically acquired predominant sense information, in cases where there was a unique automatic top ranked sense: correcttok | WSDsc = | |SCtokensafs | × 100 (11) 19 Although we do not evaluate words for which there were no neighbors in the thesaurus, we could extend.</S>
			<S sid ="385" ssid = "35">the thesaurus to include some of these by widening the range of grammatical relations covered and compensating for some systematic PoS tagging errors.</S>
			<S sid ="386" ssid = "36">20 If we exclude these words with joint top ranking from the automatic method (precision rather than recall).</S>
			<S sid ="387" ssid = "37">then we obtain marginally higher accuracy for the jcn measure but no difference for lesk.</S>
			<S sid ="388" ssid = "38">571 where |correcttok | is the number of tokens disambiguated correctly out of the tokens in SemCor having an automatically acquired first sense (SCtokensafs ).</S>
			<S sid ="389" ssid = "39">SC FS is the WSD accuracy of the SemCor first sense heuristic on the same set of tokens (SCtokensafs ), which is the upper bound because the information it uses is derived from the test data itself.</S>
			<S sid ="390" ssid = "40">RBL is the random baseline for the WSD task, calculated by splitting the credit for each token to be tagged in the test data evenly between all of the word’s senses.</S>
			<S sid ="391" ssid = "41">RBL = &apos;S 1 ∈ afs |senses(w)| |SCtokensafs | × 100 (12) The results are shown in Table 9.</S>
			<S sid ="392" ssid = "42">We examined differences between the semantic similarity measures (lesk and jcn), the BNC and DEP thesauruses, and the DEP and PROX thesauruses using the χ2 test of significance with one degree of freedom (Siegel and Castellan 1988).</S>
			<S sid ="393" ssid = "43">None of the differences between the different combinations of similarity measures and thesauruses for the type-based measure PSacc are significant.</S>
			<S sid ="394" ssid = "44">The differences between lesk and jcn are significant for the token-based measure WSDsc for both the BNC and PROX thesauruses (both p &lt; .001), however not when comparing lesk and jcn for the DEP thesaurus.</S>
			<S sid ="395" ssid = "45">Although lesk is more accurate than jcn, at least on the WSD task, jcn is much faster because of the precompilation of IC in the WordNet similarity package; however, lesk has the additional benefit of being applicable to other parts of speech.</S>
			<S sid ="396" ssid = "46">The method gives particularly good results for adjectives, given that they have a similar random baseline to nouns.</S>
			<S sid ="397" ssid = "47">It does not do so well for adverbs and verbs, but still performs well above the random baseline which is low for verbs due to their high degree of polysemy.</S>
			<S sid ="398" ssid = "48">Given that the first sense heuristic from SemCor is particularly strong for adverbs, it is disappointing that the automatic method does not perform as well as it does on adjectives.</S>
			<S sid ="399" ssid = "49">One possible reason for this might be that adverbs are often less strongly associated to the verbs that they modify than adjectives are to the nouns that they modify, so the distributional thesaurus information is less reliable.</S>
			<S sid ="400" ssid = "50">Another reason may be that less data are available for adverbs, both in the thesaurus and also in WordNet.</S>

			<S sid ="423" ssid = "73">Even though the differences between jcn DEP and jcn PROX are significant, the absolute differences are nevertheless relatively small; this bodes well for applying the automatic predominant sense method to languages less well resourced than English, because the PROX thesaurus was produced without using a parser.</S>
			<S sid ="424" ssid = "74">The differences in results between jcn BNC and jcn DEP for nouns are statistically significant (p &lt; .001).21 The better accuracy with DEP may be because the NEWSWIRE corpus is larger than the BNC.</S>

			<S sid ="428" ssid = "78">A simple variation of our method is just to associate each neighbor with just one sense and use the number of neighbors associated with a sense for the prevalence score.</S>
			<S sid ="429" ssid = "79">This gives a modified version of Equation (1) where each sense si ∈ senses(w) is assigned a score as follows: Simplified Prevalence Score(w, si ) = |{nj ⊂ Nw } : arg max (sss(sk , nj )) = si | (13) sk ∈senses(w) where sss(sk , nj ) = max sx ∈senses(nj ) ssst (sk , sx ) (14) For the example in Table 6, celebrity would get the top score of 2 (due to it having the highest sss for actor and footballer), celestial body would get a score of 1 (due to its sss with planet), shape would get 1 (due to circle), and zodiac would obtain a Simplified Prevalence Score of 0 because it does not have the highest sss for any of the neighbors.</S>

			<S sid ="466" ssid = "116">neighbors There are not many neighbors related to the sense.</S>
			<S sid ="467" ssid = "117">There can be various reasons for this, such as the sense having restricted contexts of occurrence or only a small number of near synonyms existing for the sense.</S>
			<S sid ="468" ssid = "118">An example of this is the adjective live where the SemCor FS unrecorded sense seems to occur in the BNC corpus more than the alive sense; there are plenty of grammatical relations pertaining to this sense, but there are few distributional neighbors near in meaning to unrecorded.23 spurious similarity The WordNet similarity scores were misled by spurious relationships to neighbors; this can occur in dense areas such as the “physical object” region of the noun hyponym hierarchy.</S>
			<S sid ="469" ssid = "119">An example of this is the verb tap which has neighbors push and press which are related to the AUTO FS (solicit) as well as the SemCor FS (strike lightly).</S>

			<S sid ="471" ssid = "121">The analysis shows that differences between the training (BNC) and testing (SemCor) corpora are not a major source of error.</S>
			<S sid ="472" ssid = "122">Although SemCor itself (the released files from the Brown corpus comprising only 200,000 words) is not large enough to build a thesaurus with entries for a reasonable portion of the words, we did build a thesaurus from the entire Brown corpus (1 million words) to see the effect of corpus data.</S>
			<S sid ="473" ssid = "123">The results are compared to those from the BNC in Table 12 on the set of words which had thesaurus entries in the Brown data (to make the results more comparable, because the corpora are of such different sizes).</S>

			<S sid ="478" ssid = "128">For nouns, it was apparent that in two cases less-prevalent senses were receiving a higher ranking simply because the credit for some neighbors associated with another meaning was split between related senses (error type competing).</S>
			<S sid ="479" ssid = "129">This was not observed for other parts of speech, possibly because the AUTO FS was rarely unrelated to the SemCor FS.</S>
			<S sid ="480" ssid = "130">There were some problems arising from spurious similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="481" ssid = "131">One possible source of such problems is due to the ambiguity of the neighbor; in the future we will look at reducing this source of error by removing neighbors which have a value for sx in Equation (2) which is not the same as that preferred by the other senses of the target word (w).</S>

			<S sid ="484" ssid = "134">Verbs are on average highly polysemous, and often have senses that are related.</S>
			<S sid ="485" ssid = "135">Furthermore, the structure of the WordNet verb troponym hierarchy is very shallow compared to the noun hyponymy hierarchy, so there 23 The closest neighbors to the adjective live are adult, forthcoming, lively, solo, excellent, stuffed, living, dead,.</S>

			<S sid ="492" ssid = "142">So, although we tried to identify the main problem source, for verbs the problems usually arose from a combination of factors and the relatedness of the senses was usually one of these.</S>
			<S sid ="493" ssid = "143">Relatedness of senses and fine-grained distinctions are major sources of error.</S>
			<S sid ="494" ssid = "144">There have been various attempts to group WordNet senses both manually and automatically (Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle 2003; McCarthy 2006; Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="495" ssid = "145">Indeed, McCarthy demonstrated that distributional and semantic similarity can be used for relating word senses and that such methods increase accuracy of first sense heuristics, including the automatic method proposed here.</S>
			<S sid ="496" ssid = "146">WSD is improved with coarser-grained inventories but ultimately, performance depends on the application.</S>
			<S sid ="497" ssid = "147">For example, the noun bar has 11 senses in WordNet 1.6.</S>
			<S sid ="498" ssid = "148">These include the pub sense as well as the counter sense and these are related to a certain extent.</S>
			<S sid ="499" ssid = "149">One might want to group them when acquiring predominant senses, but there may be situations where they should be distinguished.</S>
			<S sid ="500" ssid = "150">For example, if one were to ask a robot to “go to the bar ” one would hope it could use the context to go get the drinks rather than replying that it is already there!</S>
			<S sid ="501" ssid = "151">Even in cases where fine-grained distinctions are ultimately required, it may be helpful to have a coarse-grained prior and then use contextual features to tease apart subtle sense distinctions.</S>
			<S sid ="502" ssid = "152">From our error analysis, the problem of semantically isolated senses (identified as neighbors) was not a major source of error, but still causes some problems.</S>
			<S sid ="503" ssid = "153">One possible remedy might be to identify these cases by looking for neighbors which relate strongly to a sense which none of the other neighbors relate to and weighting the contribution from these neighbors more.</S>
			<S sid ="504" ssid = "154">This may however give rise to further errors because of the noise introduced by focusing on individual neighbors.</S>
			<S sid ="505" ssid = "155">We will explore such directions in future work.</S>
			<S sid ="506" ssid = "156">576 In this experiment we did not assign any credit for near misses.</S>
			<S sid ="507" ssid = "157">In many cases of error the SemCor FS nonetheless received a high prevalence score.</S>
			<S sid ="508" ssid = "158">In the future we hope to use the score for probability estimation, and combine this with contextual information for WSD as in related work by Lapata and Brew (2004) and Chan and Ng (2005).</S>
			<S sid ="509" ssid = "159">6.2 Experiment 2: Frequency and the SemCor First Sense Heuristic.</S>
			<S sid ="510" ssid = "160">In the previous section we described an evaluation of the accuracy of automatically acquired predominant sense information.</S>
			<S sid ="511" ssid = "161">We carried out the evaluation with respect to SemCor in order to have as much test data as possible.</S>
			<S sid ="512" ssid = "162">To obtain reasonably reliable gold-standard first-sense data and first-sense heuristic upper bounds, we limited the evaluation to words occurring at least three times in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="513" ssid = "163">Clearly this scenario is unrealistic.</S>
			<S sid ="514" ssid = "164">For many words, and particularly for nouns, there is very little or no data in SemCor; Table 2 shows that 81.9% of nouns (excluding multiwords) listed in WordNet do not occur at all in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="515" ssid = "165">Thus, even for English, which has substantial manually sense-tagged resources, coverage is severely limited for many words.</S>
			<S sid ="516" ssid = "166">For a more realistic comparison of automatic and manual heuristics, we therefore now change to a different test corpus, the Senseval2 English all-words task data set.</S>
			<S sid ="517" ssid = "167">We focus on nouns and evaluate using all words regardless of their frequencies in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="518" ssid = "168">We examine the effect of frequency in SemCor on performance of a SemCor-derived heuristic in comparison to results from our automatic method on the same words.</S>
			<S sid ="519" ssid = "169">Our hypothesis is that although automatically acquired predominant sense information may not outperform first-sense data obtained from a hand-tagged resource over all words in a text, the information may well be more accurate for low frequency items.</S>
			<S sid ="520" ssid = "170">We use a mapping between different WordNet versions25 (Daude´ , Padro´ , and Rigau 2000) to obtain the Senseval2 all words noun data (originally distributed with 1.7 sense numbers) with 1.6 sense numbers.</S>
			<S sid ="521" ssid = "171">As well as examining the performance of our method in contrast to the SemCor heuristic, we calculate an upper bound for this using the first sense heuristic from the Senseval2 all-words data itself.</S>
			<S sid ="522" ssid = "172">This is obtained for nouns with two or more occurrences in the Senseval2 data and where one sense occurs more than any of the others.</S>
			<S sid ="523" ssid = "173">We calculate type, precision, and recall, using this Senseval2 first-sense as the gold standard.</S>
			<S sid ="524" ssid = "174">The recall measure is the same as PSacc described previously, except that we include items which do not have entries in the thesaurus, scoring them incorrect.</S>
			<S sid ="525" ssid = "175">Precision only includes items where there is a sense ranked higher than any other for that word with the prevalence score, that is, it does not include items with a joint automatic ranking.</S>
			<S sid ="526" ssid = "176">We also calculate token precision and recall (WSD).</S>
			<S sid ="527" ssid = "177">These measures relate to WSDsc , but again, recall includes words not in the thesaurus which are scored incorrect, and precision does not include items with a joint automatic ranking.</S>
			<S sid ="528" ssid = "178">We also separately compute WSD precision for words not in SemCor (NISC).</S>
			<S sid ="529" ssid = "179">The results are shown in Table 13.26 The automatically acquired predominant sense results (the first six lines of results in the table) are approaching the SemCor-derived results (third line from the bottom of the table).</S>
			<S sid ="530" ssid = "180">The NISC results are particularly encouraging, but with the caveat that there are only 17 such words in the data.</S>
			<S sid ="531" ssid = "181">The precision for these items is higher than the 25 This mapping is available at http://www.lsi.upc.es/~nlp/tools/mapping.html..</S>

			<S sid ="537" ssid = "187">This is because the nouns involved are less frequent so tend to be less polysemous and consequently have a higher random baseline.</S>
			<S sid ="538" ssid = "188">There are a few nouns that are not in the automatic ranking, but this is due to the fact that neighbors were not collected for these nouns in the thesaurus because of tagging or parser errors or the particular set of grammatical relations used.</S>
			<S sid ="539" ssid = "189">It should be possible to extend the range of grammatical relations, or use proximity-based relations, so that neighbors can be obtained in these cases.</S>
			<S sid ="540" ssid = "190">It would also be possible to assign some credit in the case of joint top ranked senses to increase coverage.</S>
			<S sid ="541" ssid = "191">Looking at Table 13 in more detail, it seems to be the case that although the BNC thesaurus does well in identifying the first sense of a word (the type results), the PROX and DEP thesauruses from the NEWSWIRE corpus return better WSD results when used with the jcn measure.</S>
			<S sid ="542" ssid = "192">This is possibly because jcn works well for more frequent items due to its incorporation of frequency information, and the NEWSWIRE corpus has more data for frequent words, although coverage is not as good as the BNC as seen by the bigger differences in precision and recall and the figures in Table 8.</S>
			<S sid ="543" ssid = "193">The lower coverage may be due to the narrower domain and genre of the NEWSWIRE corpus, though spelling and capitalization differences probably also account for some differences.</S>
			<S sid ="544" ssid = "194">Table 14 shows results on the Senseval2 nouns for the best similarity measure and thesaurus combinations in Table 13 for nouns at or below various frequencies in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="545" ssid = "195">(The differences between the DEP and PROX thesauruses are negligible at frequencies of 10 or below, so for those we report only the results for DEP.)</S>
			<S sid ="546" ssid = "196">As we anticipated, for low frequency words the automatic methods do give more accurate predominant sense information than SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="547" ssid = "197">The low number of test items at frequency five or less means that results for jcn with the BNC thesaurus are not significantly better when compared with SemCor ( p = .05); however the lesk WSD results are significantly better ( p &lt; .01 for the ≤ 1 threshold and p &lt; .05 for the ≤ 5 threshold).</S>
			<S sid ="548" ssid = "198">On the whole, we see that the automatic method, using either jcn or lesk and any of the three thesauruses, tend to give better results than SemCor on nouns which have low coverage in SemCor.</S>

			<S sid ="571" ssid = "221">The two domain-specific corpora were: SPORTS (Reuters topic code GSPO), 9.1 million words FINANCE (Reuters topic codes ECAT and MCAT), 32.5 million words In that work we produced sense rankings for a set of 38 nouns which have at least one synset with an economy SFC label and one with a sport SFC label.</S>
			<S sid ="572" ssid = "222">We then demonstrated that there were more sport labels assigned to the predominant senses acquired from the SPORTS corpus and more economy labels assigned to those from the FINANCE corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="573" ssid = "223">The predominant senses from both domains had a similarly high percentage of factotum (domain-independent) labels.</S>
			<S sid ="574" ssid = "224">We reproduce the results here (in Figure 4) for ease of reference, and for comparison with other results presented in this section.</S>
			<S sid ="575" ssid = "225">The y-axis in this figure shows the percentage of the predominant sense labels for these 38 nouns that have the SFC label indicated by the x-axis.</S>
			<S sid ="576" ssid = "226">We envisaged running the same experiment with verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, although we suspected that these would show less domain-specific tendencies and there would be fewer candidate words to work with.</S>
			<S sid ="577" ssid = "227">The SFC labels for all senses of polysemous words (excluding multiwords) in the various parts of speech are shown in Table 15.</S>
			<S sid ="578" ssid = "228">We see from the distribution of factotum labels across the parts of speech that nouns are certainly the PoS most likely to be influenced by domain.</S>
			<S sid ="579" ssid = "229">To produce results like Figure 4 for each PoS, we needed words having at least one synset with a sport label and one with an economy label.</S>
			<S sid ="580" ssid = "230">There were 20 such verbs but 581 Figure 4 Distribution of domain labels of predominant senses for 38 polysemous nouns ranked using the SPORTS and FINANCE corpora.</S>

			<S sid ="635" ssid = "285">After running the predominant sense finding algorithms on the raw text of the two domain corpora (SPORTS and FINANCE) and the domain-neutral corpus (BNC), we evaluate the accuracy of performing WSD on the sample of 40 words purely with the first sense heuristic using all nine combinations of training and test corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="636" ssid = "286">The results (as given in Table 16) are compared with a random baseline (“Random BL”)28 and the accuracy using the first sense heuristic from SemCor (“SemCor FS”).29 The results in Table 16 show that the best results are obtained when the predominant senses are acquired using the appropriate domain (i.e., test and training data from the same domain).</S>

			<S sid ="653" ssid = "303">Although the previous experiment shows that it is possible to acquire domain-specific predominant senses successfully, the usefulness of doing this will be far greater if there is no need to classify corpora with respect to domain by hand.</S>

			<S sid ="656" ssid = "306">In this section we describe an experiment where we build a text classifier using WordNet as a sense inventory and the SFC domain extension (see Section 6.3).</S>
			<S sid ="657" ssid = "307">We extracted bags of domain-specific words from WordNet for all the defined domains by collecting all the word senses (synsets) and corresponding glosses associated with each domain label.</S>
			<S sid ="658" ssid = "308">These bags of words are the fingerprints for the domains and we used them to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) text classifier using TwentyOne.30 The classifier distinguishes between 48 classes (the first and second levels of the SFC hierarchy).</S>

	<SECTION title="Conclusions. " number = "7">
			<S sid ="674" ssid = "1">In this article we have argued that information on the predominant sense of words is important, and that it is desirable to be able to infer this automatically from unlabeled text.</S>
			<S sid ="675" ssid = "2">We presented a number of evaluations investigating various facets of a previously proposed method for automatically acquiring this information (McCarthy et al. 2004a).</S>
			<S sid ="676" ssid = "3">The evaluations extend ones in previous publications in a number of ways: they use larger, balanced test data sets, and they compare alternative semantic similarity scores and distributional thesauruses derived from different corpora and based on different kinds of relations.</S>
			<S sid ="677" ssid = "4">We also looked in detail at areas where the method performs well and also where it does not, and carried out a manual error analysis to identify the types of mistakes it makes.</S>
			<S sid ="678" ssid = "5">Our main results are: • The predominant sense acquisition method produces promising results overall for all open class parts of speech, when evaluated on SemCor, a large balanced corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="679" ssid = "6">• The highest accuracies are for nouns and adjectives; overall accuracy for verbs is lower, but they have the lowest random baseline; adverbs have the lowest average polysemy but gains over the random baseline are lower than for other PoS.</S>
			<S sid ="680" ssid = "7">• Using a thesaurus computed from proximity-based relations produces almost as good results as using an otherwise identical one computed from syntactic dependency-based relations.</S>
			<S sid ="681" ssid = "8">• Lesk’s semantic similarity score (Banerjee and Pedersen 2002, lesk) produces particularly good results for nouns which have low corpus frequencies; Jiang and Conrath’s (1997, jcn) score does well on higher frequency words.31 • For low frequency nouns in SemCor, the method, using any combination of automatically acquired thesaurus and semantic similarity score that we tried, produces more accurate predominant sense information than SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="682" ssid = "9">In particular, for nouns with a frequency of five or less (12.9% of the polysemous nouns in the Senseval2 data) it outperforms the SemCor first sense heuristic.</S>
			<S sid ="683" ssid = "10">As the threshold is increased, the SemCor first sense 31 The lesk score has wider applicability than jcn since it can be applied to all parts of speech.</S>
			<S sid ="684" ssid = "11">It can also be.</S>
			<S sid ="685" ssid = "12">used with any sense inventory which has textual definitions for its senses even if the inventory does not contain WordNet-like semantic relations.</S>
			<S sid ="686" ssid = "13">586 heuristic becomes more competitive, but some of the automatic methods are still outperforming it for nouns occurring 20 or fewer times in SemCor.</S>
			<S sid ="687" ssid = "14">• Nouns show a stronger tendency for domain-specific meanings than other parts of speech, but predominant senses for verbs acquired automatically with respect to domain-specific corpora also correlate with the appropriate domain labeling for those senses.</S>
			<S sid ="688" ssid = "15">• Predominant senses acquired using domain-specific corpora outperform those from SemCor ina WSD task, for a selection of nouns, using corpora consisting of either hand-classified or automatically-classified documents.</S>
	</SECTION>
	<SECTION title="Further Work. " number = "8">
			<S sid ="689" ssid = "1">We are continuing to work on automatic ranking of word senses for WSD.</S>
			<S sid ="690" ssid = "2">Our next step will be to use the numeric values of sense prevalence scores to compare the skews in the distributions of word senses across different corpora and see if this enables us to detect automatically words for which a domain- or genre-specific ranking is warranted.</S>
			<S sid ="691" ssid = "3">Looking at skews should also help in predicting words for which contextual WSD is likely to be particularly powerful, for example when more than one sense is scored as being highly prevalent.</S>
			<S sid ="692" ssid = "4">In such situations we will combine our method with an approach to unsupervised context-based WSD which uses the collocates of the distributional neighbors associated with each of the senses as contextual features.</S>
			<S sid ="693" ssid = "5">Our error analysis shows that many errors in identifying predominant senses are caused by the sense distinctions in WordNet being particularly fine-grained.</S>
			<S sid ="694" ssid = "6">We have recently (Koeling and McCarthy 2007) evaluated our method on the coarse-grained English all words task at SemEval (Navigli, Litkowski, and Hargraves 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="695" ssid = "7">We will follow work on finding relationships between WordNet senses to induce coarser-grained classes (McCarthy 2006), and on automatic induction of senses (Pantel and Lin 2002) and adapt our method to acquire prevalence rankings for these.</S>
			<S sid ="696" ssid = "8">The granularity of the inventory will depend on the application and we plan to apply rankings over such inventories for WSD within the context of a task, such as lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="697" ssid = "9">To date we have only applied our methods to English.</S>
			<S sid ="698" ssid = "10">We plan to apply our approach to other languages for which sense tagged resources of the size of SemCor are not available.</S>
			<S sid ="699" ssid = "11">Given the good results with Lin’s proximity based thesaurus we believe our method should work even for languages which do not have high quality parsers available.</S>
