			<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">The goal of “lightweight” semantic annotation of text, particularly in scenarios with limited resources and expertise, presents several requirements for arepresentation: simplicity; adaptability to new lan guages, topics, and genres; and coverage.</S>
			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">This paper describes coarse lexical semantic annotationof Arabic Wikipedia articles subject to these con straints.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Traditional lexical semantic representations are either narrow in scope, like named entities,1 or make reference to a full-fledged lexicon/ontology, which may insufficiently cover the language/domainof interest or require prohibitive expertise and ef fort to apply.2 We therefore turn to supersense tags (SSTs), 40 coarse lexical semantic classes (25 fornouns, 15 for verbs) originating in WordNet.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Previ ously these served as groupings of English lexicon 1Some ontologies like those in Sekine et al.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">(2002) and BBN Identifinder (Bikel et al., 1999) include a large selection of classes, which tend to be especially relevant to proper names.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">2E.g., a WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) sense annotation effortreported by Passonneau et al.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">(2010) found considerable inter annotator variability for some lexemes; FrameNet (Baker etal., 1998) is limited in coverage, even for English; and Prop Bank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) does not capture semanticrelationships across lexemes.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">We note that the Omega ontology (Philpot et al., 2003) has been used for fine-grained cross lingual annotation (Hovy et al., 2006; Dorr et al., 2010).</S>

			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Part of the earliest versions of WordNet, the supersense categories (originally, “lexicographer classes”) were intended to partition all English noun and verb senses into broad groupings, or semanticfields (Miller, 1990; Fellbaum, 1990).</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">More re cently, the task of automatic supersense tagging has emerged for English (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Curran, 2005; Ciaramita and Altun, 2006; Paaß and Reichartz, 2009), as well as for Italian (Picca et al., 2008; Picca et al., 2009; Attardi et al., 2010) and Chinese (Qiu et al., 2011), languages with WordNetsmapped to English WordNet.3 In principle, we be lieve supersenses ought to apply to nouns and verbsin any language, and need not depend on the avail ability of a semantic lexicon.4 In this work we focuson the noun SSTs, summarized in figure 2 and ap plied to an Arabic sentence in figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">SSTs both refine and relate lexical items: they capture lexical polysemy on the one hand—e.g.,3Note that work in supersense tagging used text with fine grained sense annotations that were then coarsened to SSTs.</S>

			<S sid ="37" ssid = "1">The annotation in this work was on top of a smallcorpus of Arabic Wikipedia articles that had al ready been annotated for named entities (Mohit et al., 2012).</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "2">Here we use two different annotators, both native speakers of Arabic attending a university with English as the language of instruction.</S>

			<S sid ="42" ssid = "6">Working in a custom, browser based interface, annotators were to tag each relevanttoken with a supersense category by selecting the to ken and typing a tag symbol.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "7">Any token could be marked as continuing a multiword unit by typing &amp;lt;.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "8">If the annotator was ambivalent about a token they were to mark it with the ? symbol.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "9">Sentences werepre-tagged with suggestions where possible.6 Anno tators noted obvious errors in sentence splitting and grammar so ill-formed sentences could be excluded.Training.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "10">Over several months, annotators alternately annotated sentences from 2 designated arti cles of each domain, and reviewed the annotationsfor consistency.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "11">All tagging conventions were deve loped collaboratively by the author(s) and annotators during this period, informed by points of confusionand disagreement.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "12">WordNet and SemCor were con sulted as part of developing the guidelines, but not during annotation itself so as to avoid complicating the annotation process or overfitting to WordNet’sidiosyncracies.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "13">The training phase ended once inter annotator mention FI had reached 75%.6Suggestions came from the previous named entity annota tion of PERSONs, organizations (GROUP), and LOCATIONs, as well as heuristic lookup in lexical resources—Arabic WordNet entries (Elkateb et al., 2006) mapped to English WordNet, and named entities in OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006).</S>

			<S sid ="61" ssid = "25">After training, the two annota tors proceeded on a per-document basis: first they worked together to annotate several sentences fromthe beginning of the article, then each was independently assigned about half of the remaining sentences (typically with 5–10 shared to measure agreement).</S>

			<S sid ="67" ssid = "31">Some of the most concrete tags—BODY, ANIMAL, PLANT, NATURAL OBJECT, and FOOD— were barely present, but would likely be frequent in life sciences domains.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "32">Others, such as MOTIVE, POSSESSION, and SHAPE, are limited in scope.To measure inter-annotator agreement, 87 sentences (2,774 tokens) distributed across 19 of the ar ticles (not including those used in pilot rounds) wereannotated independently by each annotator.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "33">Interannotator mention Fl (counting agreement over en tire mentions and their labels) was 70%.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "34">Excluding the 1,397 tokens left blank by both annotators, the token-level agreement rate was 71%, with Cohen’s n = 0.69, and token-level Fl was 83%.7We also measured agreement on a tag-by-tag basis.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "35">For 8 of the 10 most frequent SSTs (fig ure 3), inter-annotator mention Fl ranged from 73% to 80%.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "36">The two exceptions were QUANTITY at63%, and COGNITION (probably the most heterogeneous category) at 49%.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "37">An examination of the confusion matrix reveals four pairs of supersense cate gories that tended to provoke the most disagreement: COMMUNICATION/COGNITION, ACT/COGNITION, ACT/PROCESS, and ARTIFACT/COMMUNICATION.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "38">7Token-level measures consider both the supersense label and whether it begins or continues the mention.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "39">The last is exhibited for the first mention in figure 1, where one annotator chose ARTIFACT (referring tothe physical book) while the other chose COMMUNICATION (the content).</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "40">Also in that sentence, an notators disagreed on the second use of university(ARTIFACT vs. GROUP).</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "41">As with any sense anno tation effort, some disagreements due to legitimate ambiguity and different interpretations of the tags— especially the broadest ones—are unavoidable.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "42">A “soft” agreement measure (counting as matches any two mentions with the same label and at leastone token in common) gives an Fl of 79%, showing that boundary decisions account for a major portion of the disagreement.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "43">E.g., the city Fez, Mo rocco (figure 1) was tagged as a single LOCATION by one annotator and as two by the other.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "44">Further examples include the technical term ‘thin client’, for which one annotator omitted the adjective; and‘World Cup Football Championship’, where one an notator tagged the entire phrase as an EVENT while the other tagged ‘football’ as a separate ACT.</S>
