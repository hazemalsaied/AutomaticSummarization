Abstract
“Lightweight” semantic annotation of text
calls for a simple representation, ideally with-
out requiring a semantic lexicon to achieve
good coverage in the language and domain.
In this paper, we repurpose WordNet’s super-
sense tags for annotation, developing specific
guidelines for nominal expressions and ap-
plying them to Arabic Wikipedia articles in
four topical domains. The resulting corpus
has high coverage and was completed quickly
with reasonable inter-annotator agreement.

1 Introduction

The goal of “lightweight” semantic annotation of
text, particularly in scenarios with limited resources
and expertise, presents several requirements for a
representation: simplicity; adaptability to new lan-
guages, topics, and genres; and coverage. This
paper describes coarse lexical semantic annotation
of Arabic Wikipedia articles subject to these con-
straints. Traditional lexical semantic representations
are either narrow in scope, like named entities,1 or
make reference to a full-fledged lexicon/ontology,
which may insufficiently cover the language/domain
of interest or require prohibitive expertise and ef-
fort to apply.2 We therefore turn to supersense tags
(SSTs), 40 coarse lexical semantic classes (25 for
nouns, 15 for verbs) originating in WordNet. Previ-
ously these served as groupings of English lexicon

 
1Some ontologies like those in Sekine et al. (2002) and BBN
Identifinder (Bikel et al., 1999) include a large selection of
classes, which tend to be especially relevant to proper names.
2E.g., a WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) sense annotation effort
reported by Passonneau et al. (2010) found considerable inter-
annotator variability for some lexemes; FrameNet (Baker et
al., 1998) is limited in coverage, even for English; and Prop-
Bank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) does not capture semantic
relationships across lexemes. We note that the Omega ontol-
 
 
ogy (Philpot et al., 2003) has been used for fine-grained cross-
lingual annotation (Hovy et al., 2006; Dorr et al., 2010).

entries, but here we have repurposed them as target
labels for direct human annotation.
Part of the earliest versions of WordNet, the
supersense categories (originally, “lexicographer
classes”) were intended to partition all English noun
and verb senses into broad groupings, or semantic
fields (Miller, 1990; Fellbaum, 1990). More re-
cently, the task of automatic supersense tagging has
emerged for English (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003;
Curran, 2005; Ciaramita and Altun, 2006; Paaß and
Reichartz, 2009), as well as for Italian (Picca et al.,
2008; Picca et al., 2009; Attardi et al., 2010) and
Chinese (Qiu et al., 2011), languages with WordNets
mapped to English WordNet.3 In principle, we be-
lieve supersenses ought to apply to nouns and verbs
in any language, and need not depend on the avail-
ability of a semantic lexicon.4 In this work we focus
on the noun SSTs, summarized in figure 2 and ap-
plied to an Arabic sentence in figure 1.
SSTs both refine and relate lexical items: they
capture lexical polysemy on the one hand—e.g.,
 
 
3Note that work in supersense tagging used text with fine-
grained sense annotations that were then coarsened to SSTs.
4The noun/verb distinction might prove problematic in some
languages.

disambiguating PERSON vs. POSSESSION for the
noun principal—and generalize across lexemes on
the other—e.g., principal, teacher, and student can
all be PERSONs. This lumping property might be
expected to give too much latitude to annotators; yet
we find that in practice, it is possible to elicit reason-
able inter-annotator agreement, even for a language
other than English. We encapsulate our interpreta-
tion of the tags in a set of brief guidelines that aims
to be usable by anyone who can read and understand
a text in the target language; our annotators had no
prior expertise in linguistics or linguistic annotation.
Finally, we note that ad hoc categorization
schemes not unlike SSTs have been developed for
purposes ranging from question answering (Li and
Roth, 2002) to animacy hierarchy representation for
corpus linguistics (Zaenen et al., 2004). We believe
the interpretation of the SSTs adopted here can serve
as a single starting point for diverse resource en-
gineering efforts and applications, especially when
fine-grained sense annotation is not feasible.
 
 
2 Tagging Conventions
 
 
WordNet’s definitions of the supersenses are terse,
and we could find little explicit discussion of the
specific rationales behind each category. Thus,
we have crafted more specific explanations, sum-
marized for nouns in figure 2. English examples
are given, but the guidelines are intended to be
language-neutral. A more systematic breakdown,
formulated as a 43-rule decision list, is included
with the corpus.5 In developing these guidelines
we consulted English WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)
and SemCor (Miller et al., 1993) for examples and
synset definitions, occasionally making simplifying
decisions where we found distinctions that seemed
esoteric or internally inconsistent. Special cases
(e.g., multiword expressions, anaphora, figurative
 
 
5For example, one rule states that all man-made structures
(buildings, rooms, bridges, etc.) are to be tagged as ARTIFACTs.
 
 
language) are addressed with additional rules.
 
 
3 Arabic Wikipedia Annotation
 
 
The annotation in this work was on top of a small
corpus of Arabic Wikipedia articles that had al-
ready been annotated for named entities (Mohit et
al., 2012). Here we use two different annotators,
both native speakers of Arabic attending a university
with English as the language of instruction.
Data &amp; procedure. The dataset (table 1) consists of
the main text of 28 articles selected from the topical
domains of history, sports, science, and technology.
The annotation task was to identify and categorize
mentions, i.e., occurrences of terms belonging to
noun supersenses. Working in a custom, browser-
based interface, annotators were to tag each relevant
token with a supersense category by selecting the to-
ken and typing a tag symbol. Any token could be
marked as continuing a multiword unit by typing &lt;.
If the annotator was ambivalent about a token they
were to mark it with the ? symbol. Sentences were
pre-tagged with suggestions where possible.6 Anno-
tators noted obvious errors in sentence splitting and
grammar so ill-formed sentences could be excluded.
Training. Over several months, annotators alter-
nately annotated sentences from 2 designated arti-
cles of each domain, and reviewed the annotations
for consistency. All tagging conventions were deve-
loped collaboratively by the author(s) and annotators
during this period, informed by points of confusion
and disagreement. WordNet and SemCor were con-
sulted as part of developing the guidelines, but not
during annotation itself so as to avoid complicating
the annotation process or overfitting to WordNet’s
idiosyncracies. The training phase ended once inter-
annotator mention FI had reached 75%.
 
 
6Suggestions came from the previous named entity annota-
tion of PERSONs, organizations (GROUP), and LOCATIONs, as
well as heuristic lookup in lexical resources—Arabic WordNet
entries (Elkateb et al., 2006) mapped to English WordNet, and
named entities in OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006).

Main annotation. After training, the two annota-
tors proceeded on a per-document basis: first they
worked together to annotate several sentences from
the beginning of the article, then each was inde-
pendently assigned about half of the remaining sen-
tences (typically with 5–10 shared to measure agree-
ment). Throughout the process, annotators were en-
couraged to discuss points of confusion with each
other, but each sentence was annotated in its entirety
and never revisited. Annotation of 28 articles re-
quired approximately 100 annotator-hours. Articles
used in pilot rounds were re-annotated from scratch.
Analysis. Figure 3 shows the distribution of SSTs in
the corpus. Some of the most concrete tags—BODY,
ANIMAL, PLANT, NATURAL OBJECT, and FOOD—
were barely present, but would likely be frequent
in life sciences domains. Others, such as MOTIVE,
POSSESSION, and SHAPE, are limited in scope.
To measure inter-annotator agreement, 87 sen-
tences (2,774 tokens) distributed across 19 of the ar-
ticles (not including those used in pilot rounds) were
annotated independently by each annotator. Inter-
annotator mention Fl (counting agreement over en-
tire mentions and their labels) was 70%. Excluding
the 1,397 tokens left blank by both annotators, the
token-level agreement rate was 71%, with Cohen’s
n = 0.69, and token-level Fl was 83%.7
We also measured agreement on a tag-by-tag ba-
sis. For 8 of the 10 most frequent SSTs (fig-
ure 3), inter-annotator mention Fl ranged from 73%
to 80%. The two exceptions were QUANTITY at
63%, and COGNITION (probably the most heteroge-
neous category) at 49%. An examination of the con-
fusion matrix reveals four pairs of supersense cate-
gories that tended to provoke the most disagreement:
COMMUNICATION/COGNITION, ACT/COGNITION,
ACT/PROCESS, and ARTIFACT/COMMUNICATION.
7Token-level measures consider both the supersense label
and whether it begins or continues the mention.
The last is exhibited for the first mention in figure 1,
where one annotator chose ARTIFACT (referring to
the physical book) while the other chose COMMU-
NICATION (the content). Also in that sentence, an-
notators disagreed on the second use of university
(ARTIFACT vs. GROUP). As with any sense anno-
tation effort, some disagreements due to legitimate
ambiguity and different interpretations of the tags—
especially the broadest ones—are unavoidable.
A “soft” agreement measure (counting as matches
any two mentions with the same label and at least
one token in common) gives an Fl of 79%, show-
ing that boundary decisions account for a major por-
tion of the disagreement. E.g., the city Fez, Mo-
rocco (figure 1) was tagged as a single LOCATION
by one annotator and as two by the other. Further
examples include the technical term ‘thin client’,
for which one annotator omitted the adjective; and
‘World Cup Football Championship’, where one an-
notator tagged the entire phrase as an EVENT while
the other tagged ‘football’ as a separate ACT.
 
 
4 Conclusion
 
 
We have codified supersense tags as a simple an-
notation scheme for coarse lexical semantics, and
have shown that supersense annotation of Ara-
bic Wikipedia can be rapid, reliable, and robust
(about half the tokens in our data are covered
by a nominal supersense). Our tagging guide-
lines and corpus are available for download at
