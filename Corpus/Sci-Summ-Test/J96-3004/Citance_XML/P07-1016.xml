			<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">The study of Chinese transliteration dates back to the seventh century when Buddhist scriptures were translated into Chinese.</S>
			<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">The earliest bit of Chinese translation theory related to transliteration may be the principle of “Names should follow their bearers, while things should follow Chinese.” In other words, names should be transliterated, while things should be translated according to their meanings.</S>
			<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">The same theory still holds today.</S>
			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Transliteration has been practiced in several ways, including phonetic transliteration and phonetic-semantic transliteration.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">By phonetic 120 geo- in geometry into Chinese as 几何 /Ji-He/, which carries the pronunciation of geo- and expresses the meaning of “a science concerned with measuring the earth”.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Many of the loanwords exist in today’s Chinese through semantic transliteration, which has been well received (Hu and Xu, 2003; Hu, 2004) by the people because of many advantages.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Here we just name a few.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">(1) It brings in not only the sound, but also the meaning that fills in the semantic blank left by phonetic transliteration.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">This also reminds people that it is a loanword and avoids misleading; (2) It provides etymological clues that make it easy to trace back to the root of the words.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">For example, a transliterated Japanese name will maintain its Japanese identity in its Chinese appearance; (3) It evokes desirable associations, for example, an English girl’s name is transliterated with Chinese characters that have clear feminine association, thus maintaining the gender identity.</S>

			<S sid ="15" ssid = "3">Qc 2007 Association for Computational Linguistics Unfortunately, most of the reported work in the area of machine transliteration has not ventured into semantic transliteration yet.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "4">The Latin-scripted personal names are always assumed to homogeneously follow the English phonic rules in automatic transliteration (Li et al., 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "5">Therefore, the same transliteration model is applied to all the names indiscriminatively.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "6">This assumption degrades the performance of transliteration because each language has its own phonic rule and the Chinese characters to be adopted depend on the following semantic attributes of a foreign name.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "7">(1) Language of origin: An English word is not necessarily of pure English origin.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "8">In English news reports about Asian happenings, an English personal name may have been originated from Chinese, Japanese or Korean.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "9">The language origin affects the phonic rules and the characters to be used in transliteration3 . For example, a Japanese name Matsumoto should be transliterated as 松本 /Song-Ben/, instead of 马茨莫托 /Ma-Ci-MoTuo/ as if it were an English name.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "10">(2) Gender association: A given name typically implies a clear gender association in both the source and target languages.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "11">For example, the Chinese transliterations of Alice and Alexandraare 爱丽丝 /AiLi-Si/ and 亚历山大 /YaLi-Shan Da/ respectively, showing clear feminine and masculine characteristics.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "12">Transliterating Alice as 埃里 斯 /AiLi-Si/ is phonetically correct, but semantically inadequate due to an improper gender association.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "13">(3) Surname and given name: The Chinese name system is the original pattern of names in Eastern Asia such as China, Korea and Vietnam, in which a limited number of characters 4 are used for surnames while those for given names are less restrictive.</S>

			<S sid ="38" ssid = "10">2 Related Work.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "11">In general, computational studies of transliteration fall into two categories: transliteration modeling and extraction of transliteration pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "12">In transliteration modeling, transliteration rules are trained from a large, bilingual transliteration lexicon (Lin and Chen, 2002; Oh and Choi, 2005), with the objective of translating unknown words on the fly in an open, general domain.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "13">In the extraction of transliterations, data-driven methods are adopted to extract actual transliteration pairs from a corpus, in an effort to construct a large, up- to-date transliteration lexicon (Kuo et al., 2006; Sproat et al., 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "14">Phonetic transliteration can be considered as an extension to the traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion (Galescu and Allen, 2001), which has been a much-researched topic in the field of speech processing.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "15">If we view the grapheme and phoneme as two symbolic representations of the same word in two different languages, then G2P is a transliteration task by itself.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "16">Although G2P and phonetic transliteration are common in many ways, transliteration has its unique challenges, especially as far as E-C transliteration is concerned.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "17">E-C transliteration is the conversion between English graphemes, phonetically associated English letters, and Chinese graphemes, characters which represent ideas or meanings.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "18">As a Chinese transliteration can arouse to certain connotations, the choice of Chinese characters becomes a topic of interest (Xu et al., 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "19">Semantic transliteration can be seen as a subtask of statistical machine translation (SMT) with monotonic word ordering.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "20">By treating a letter/character as a word and a group of letters/characters as a phrase or token unit in SMT, one can easily apply the traditional SMT models, such as the IBM generative model (Brown et al., 1993) or the phrase-based translation model (Crego et al., 2005) to transliteration.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "21">In transliteration, we face similar issues as in SMT, such as lexical mapping and alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "22">However, transliteration is also different from general SMT in many ways.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "23">Unlike SMT where we aim at optimizing the semantic transfer, semantic transliteration needs to maintain the phonetic equivalence as well.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "24">In computational linguistic literature, much effort has been devoted to phonetic transliteration, such as EnglishArabic, EnglishChinese (Li et al., 2004), EnglishJapanese (Knight and Graehl, 1998) and EnglishKorean.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "25">In G2P studies, Font Llitjos and Black (2001) showed how knowledge of language of origin may improve conversion accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "26">Unfortunately semantic transliteration, which is considered as a good tradition in translation practice (Hu and Xu, 2003; Hu, 2004), has not been adequately addressed computationally in the literature.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "27">Some recent work (Li et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006) has attempted to introduce preference into a probabilistic framework for selection of Chinese characters in phonetic transliteration.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "28">However, there is neither analytical result nor semantic-motivated transliteration solution being reported.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "29">3 Feasibility of Semantic Transliteration.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "30">A Latin-scripted personal name is written in letters, which represent the pronunciations closely, whereas each Chinese character represents not only the syllables, but also the semantic associations.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "31">Thus, character rendering is a vital issue in transliteration.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "32">Good transliteration adequately projects semantic association while an inappropriate one may lead to undesirable interpretation.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "33">Is semantic transliteration possible?</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "34">Let’s first conduct an inquiry into the feasibility of semantic transliteration on 3 bilingual name corpora, which are summarizied in Table 1 and will be used in experiments.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "35">E-C corpus is an augmented version of Xinhua English to Chinese dictionary for English names (Xinhua, 1992).</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "36">J-C corpus is a romanized Japanese to Chinese dictionary for Japanese names.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "37">The C-C corpus is a Chinese Pinyin to character dictionary for Chinese names.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "38">The entries are classified into surname, male and female given name categories.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "39">The E-C corpus also contains some entries without gender/surname labels, referred to as unclassified.E C 5J C 6C C Su rn am e (S) 12, 49 0 36, 35 2 56 9,4 03 Gi ve n na me (M ) 3,2 01 35, 76 7 34 5,0 44 Gi ve n na me (F) 4,2 75 11, 81 7 12 2,7 72 Un cla ssi fie d 22, 56 2 Al l 42, 52 8 83, 93 6 1,9 72, 85 1 Table 1: Number of entries in 3 corpora Phonetic transliteration has not been a problem as Chinese has over 400 unique syllables that are enough to approximately transcribe all syllables in other languages.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "40">Different Chinese characters may render into the same syllable and form a range of homonyms.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "41">Among the homonyms, those arousing positive meanings can be used for personal names.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "42">As discussed elsewhere (Sproat et al., 1996), out of several thousand common Chinese characters, a subset of a few hundred characters tends to be used overwhelmingly for transliterating English names to Chinese, e.g. only 731 Chinese characters are adopted in the E-C corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "43">Although the character sets are shared across languages and genders, the statistics in Table 2 show that each semantic attribute is associated with some unique characters.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "44">In the C-C corpus, out of the total of 4,507 characters, only 776 of them are for surnames.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "45">It is interesting to find that female given names are represented by a smaller set of characters than that for male across 3 corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "46">E C J C C C A l l S 3 2 7 2, 1 2 9 7 7 6 2,6 12 (1 9.2 %) M 5 0 4 1, 3 9 9 4, 3 4 0 4,9 95 (2 0.0 %) F 4 7 9 1, 1 7 8 1, 3 1 8 2,1 92 (2 6.3 %) Al l 7 3 1 (4 4.</S>

			<S sid ="78" ssid = "50">The numbers in brackets indicate the percentage of characters that are shared by at least 2 corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "51">Note that the overlap of Chinese characters usage across genders is higher than that across languages.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "52">For instance, there is a 44.2% overlap 5 http://www.cjk.org 6 http://technology.chtsai.org/namelist across gender for the transcribed English names; P(L, G | S ) is the probability of the language and but only 19.2% overlap across languages for the surnames.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "53">In summary, the semantic attributes of personal names are characterized by the choice of characters, and therefore their n-gram statistics as well.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "54">If the the gender given the source, S. Given the alignment between S and T, the transliteration probability given L and G may be written as I ∏ i 1 1 (4) attributes are known in advance, then the semantic transliteration is absolutely feasible.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "55">We may obtain the semantic attributes from the context P(T | S , L, G) = i =1 I P(t | T i −1 , S i ) through trigger words.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "56">For instance, from “Mr Tony Blair”, we realize “Tony” is a male given ≈ ∏ P(ti | ti −1 , si −1 , si ) i =1 (5) name while “Blair” is a surname; from “Japanesewhere s and t are the ith token of S and T respec Prime Minister Koizumi”, we resolve that i i “Koizumi” is a Japanese surname.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "57">In the case tively and I is the total number of tokens in both S where contextual trigger words are not available, and T. S k and T k represent the sequence of tokens we study detecting the semantic attributes from the personal names themselves in the next section.</S>

			<S sid ="92" ssid = "7">To obtain the source T * = arg max P(T | S ) T∈T S (1) tokens, the source and target names in the training data are aligned using the EM algorithm.</S>

			<S sid ="95" ssid = "10">In a standard phonetic transliteration system, P(T | S ) , the posterior probability of the hypothe sized transliteration, T, given the source name, S, is directly modeled without considering any form of semantic information.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "11">On the other hand, semantic testing, each source name is first segmented into all possible token sequences given the token set.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "12">These source token sequences are mapped to the target sequences to yield an N-best list of transliteration candidates.</S>

			<S sid ="180" ssid = "49">All the MRR results are based on transliteration systems using bi- gram language models.</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "50">The table clearly shows that having perfect knowledge, denoted by “3”, of language and gender helps improve the MRR performance; detecting semantic attributes using soft decision, denoted by “c”, has a clear win over thebaseline, denoted by “2”, where semantic informa tion is not used.</S>

			<S sid ="212" ssid = "81">The baseline phonetic transliteration system yielded 36.87% and 58.39% accuracies at word and character levels respectively; and 0.4895 MRR.</S>
			<S sid ="213" ssid = "82">It can be conjectured from the results that semantic transliteration is substantially superior to phonetic transliteration.</S>
			<S sid ="214" ssid = "83">In particular, knowing the language information improved the overall MRR performance to 0.5952; and with additional gender information, the best performance of 0.6812 was obtained.</S>
			<S sid ="215" ssid = "84">Furthermore, both hard and soft decision of semantic information improved the performance, with the latter being substantially better.</S>
			<S sid ="216" ssid = "85">Both the word and character accuracies improvements were consistent and have similar trend to that observed for MRR.</S>
			<S sid ="217" ssid = "86">The performance of the semantic transliteration using soft decisions (last row of Table 10) achieved 25.1%, 33.9%, 18.5% relative improvement in MRR, word and character accuracies respectively over that of the phonetic transliteration (first row of Table 10).</S>
			<S sid ="218" ssid = "87">In addition, soft decision also presented 5.1%, 4.9% and 3.5% relative improvement over hard decision in MRR, word and character accuracies respectively.</S>

			<S sid ="220" ssid = "89">It was found that the performance of the baseline phonetic transliteration may be greatly improved by incorporating semantic information such as the language of origin and gender.</S>
			<S sid ="221" ssid = "90">Furthermore, it was found that the soft decision of language and gender outperforms the hard decision approach.</S>
			<S sid ="222" ssid = "91">The soft decision method incorporates the semantic scores P(L, G | S ) with transliteration scores P(T | S , L, G) , involving all possible semantic specific models in the decoding process.</S>
			<S sid ="223" ssid = "92">In this paper, there are 9 such models (3 languages × 3 genders).</S>

			<S sid ="226" ssid = "95">Neither soft nor hard decision requires any prior information about the names.</S>
			<S sid ="227" ssid = "96">It provides substantial performance improvement over phonetic transliteration at a reasonable computational cost.</S>
