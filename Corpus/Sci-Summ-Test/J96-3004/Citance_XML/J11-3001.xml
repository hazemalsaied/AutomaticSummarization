			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Furthermore, unsupervised approaches are more adaptive to relatively unfamiliar languages for which we do not have enough linguistic knowledge.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">In addition, unsupervised approaches can cooperate with supervised ones to overcome drawbacks of both.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">Since Sproat and Shih (1990) introduced mutual information (MI) to word segmentation, some researchers have conducted research on unsupervised approaches to word segmentation (Chang and Su 1997).</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Peng and Schuurmans (2001) proposed an unsupervised approach based on an improved expectation maximum (EM) learning algorithm and a pruning algorithm based on MI.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Their approach outperforms soft- counting (Ge, Pratt, and Smyth 1999) that is also based on EM and MI.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Non-parametric Bayesian techniques—for example, the PitmanYor process (PYP, a generalization of the Dirichlet process, DP) (Pitman and Yor 1997), hierarchical DP (HDP) (Teh et al. 2006; Goldwater, Grifﬁths, and Johnson 2006), hierarchical PYP (HPYP) (Teh 2006a, 2006b), and hierarchical HPYP (HHPYP) (Wood and Teh 2008)—have been introduced to word segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">Mochihashi, Yamada, and Ueda (2009) proposed a novel unsupervised approach based on HPYP, and evaluated it on a part of SIGHAN Bakeoff2 data set (Emerson 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">Their evaluation results suggested that their approach outperformed the previous ones.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Some approaches, such as TONGO (Ando and Lee 2000, 2003) and Voting Experts (Cohen, Heeringa, and Adams 2002; Cohen, Adams, and Heeringa 2007), are based on relatively simple ideas.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">In most cases, an unsupervised approach can be viewed as a kind of goodness measurement to ﬁnd boundaries between words or ﬁlter words from candidates or both.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">There are four goodness algorithms reviewed by Zhao and Kit (2008a).</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">The algorithms, including Description Length Gain (DLG) (Kit and Wilks 1999), Accessor Variety (Feng et al. 2004a, 2004b), and Branching Entropy (TanakaIshii 2005; Jin and TanakaIshii 2006), were evaluated on SIGHAN Bakeoff3 data set (Levow 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">In this article, we propose ESA, a new unsupervised approach to word segmentation, and demonstrate its effectiveness on Chinese corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">The approach was motivated by the following considerations: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">In contrast to the semi-supervised or supervised approaches, we want to.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">ﬁnd an approach which produces acceptable results under harsh conditions.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">The harsh conditions are lack of prior knowledge, namely, no lexicons, annotated corpora, or linguistic rules.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">The acceptability involves comparison with the gold standards, which usually means the manually segmented results.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">potential of completely unsupervised approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "40">Therefore, we try to avoid any manual interference.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "41">To avoid manual interference, we need to consider the following issues: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "42">Unsupervised approaches usually rely on a maximization strategy or.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "43">thresholds or both.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "44">Approaches adopting the maximization strategy alone can be easily adapted to various contexts with few manual adjustments, whereas approaches using thresholds may have a higher accuracy in some cases.</S>

	<SECTION title="Many approaches have constraints on maximum word length.. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "1">Furthermore, some approaches adopt different strategies for processing words of different lengths.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "2">The constraints and the different strategies may improve results on speciﬁc languages, however they reduce the generality of the approaches.</S>

	<SECTION title="Many approaches process  characters with different strategies according. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "1">to different character types.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "2">The character types are usually identiﬁed by encoding information.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "3">Because encoding information is prior knowledge of speciﬁc languages, a completely unsupervised approach should avoid it as much as possible in order to be applicable under any conditions.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "4">ESA is based on a new goodness algorithm that adopts a local maximum strategy and avoids thresholds.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "5">ESA has no constraints on maximum word length.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "6">In practice, this kind of constraint can have a negative impact on ESA’s segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "7">A simple process called Balancing is introduced to uniformly process words of different lengths.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "8">Moreover, ESA uses a self-revision mechanism to improve segmentation accuracy and guarantees convergence after a small number of iterations.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "9">In practice, ESA has only one parameter that needs to be conﬁgured, and the parameter can be predicted by empirical formulae proposed in this article.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "10">In Section 2, we describe ESA in detail.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "11">The SIGHAN Bakeoff2 archives are available for research on the ofﬁcial Web site and therefore we can easily test ESA on that data.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "12">We provide our experimental results and discuss them in Section 3.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "13">In Section 4, we compare ESA with other approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "14">Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section 5.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "15">2. ESA.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "16">ESA consists of Evaluation, Selection, and Adjustment as shown in Figure 1, and it is based on two simple ideas: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "17">A better result can be produced by combining certainty and uncertainty.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "18">The key is how to combine them.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "19">2.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "20">A better result can be produced by adopting the self-revised pattern based on an iterative process.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "21">Figure 1 ESA and input/output data.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "22">423 The input text can be viewed as a character sequence.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "23">A character sequence can be divided into two adjacent subsequences.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "24">The certainty mentioned previously means certainty of co-occurrence of adjacent subsequences.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "25">And the uncertainty means uncertainty of co-occurrence of adjacent subsequences.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "26">For example, suppose there are two character sequences, AB and AC.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "27">The occurrence of AB represents the certainty of co-occurrence of A and B, whereas the occurrence of AC represents the uncertainty of co-occurrence of A and B, and vice versa.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "28">The two kinds of information are combined to evaluate the segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "29">In other words, the decision of whether to segment a character sequence into two adjacent subsequences or not depends on both certainty and uncertainty.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "30">An iterative process can produce better results than a non-iterative scheme (Chang and Su 1997).</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "31">In fact, the current result can be viewed as prior knowledge to adjust the next one.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "32">Devising an unsupervised approach is similar to clarifying how infants segment words without explicit instructions.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "33">In particular, infants are able to learn words from various kinds of information such as familiar names (Bortfeld et al. 2005), edges of utterances (Seidl and Johnson 2006), meaning maps (Estes et al. 2007), and auditory forms of words (Swingley 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "34">There are a few notable issues: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "35">Familiarity (Bortfeld et al. 2005) can be represented by high frequency..</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "36">Frequent character sequences provide more credibility than infrequent ones.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "37">The appearance frequencies are the most important information for word segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "38">2.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "39">The edges of utterances (Seidl and Johnson 2006) can be viewed as natural.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "40">boundaries.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "41">In practice, the boundaries given by punctuation can improve the accuracy of segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "42">However, we think that punctuation should be ignored by completely unsupervised approaches in order to avoid relying on encoding information.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "43">3.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "44">Both word lists and statistical data as prior knowledge enable human.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "45">infants to segment words (Estes et al. 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "46">For a completely unsupervised approach, the prior knowledge can be the approach itself and the previous results produced by the approach.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "47">(Swingley 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "48">Some research (Goldwater, Grifﬁths, and Johnson 2006) is based on phonemes, but the input data are still text.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "49">Before completely clarifying the mechanism of human learning, we tend to believe that machines can understand symbol sequences with simple logic.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "50">2.1 Evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "51">Evaluation is the phase that gives a character sequence or a pair of adjacent subsequences a goodness value according to statistical information.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "52">There are three issues to be settled: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "53">What are the character sequence and the pair of adjacent subsequences.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "54">that can be evaluated?</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "55">2.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "56">What is the necessary statistical information and how do we get it?.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "57">3.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "58">How do we calculate the goodness?.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "59">424 2.1.1 The Target of Evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "60">A character sequence contains (N+1)× N subsequences, where N is the number of characters in the character sequence.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "61">These subsequences are the targets to be evaluated.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "62">A character sequence can be divided into various pairs of adjacent subsequences as shown in Figure 2.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "63">A pair of adjacent subsequences contains a gap that is the potential boundary between the two subsequences.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "64">Every character sequence has an individual goodness value (IV).</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "65">Every pair of adjacent subsequences has a combined goodness value (CV) based on the IV of each subsequence and the goodness value of the gap (LRV).</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "66">IV and LRV indicate certainty and uncertainty of co-occurrence, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "67">Therefore, CV is the combination of certainty and uncertainty.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "68">IV is the base of CV, and LRV serves as the modiﬁer of the base.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "69">2.1.2 The Information Needed.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "70">The information mentioned here is the statistical information that can be extracted from corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "71">There are two basic quantities to be directly measured: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "72">The frequency of a character sequence.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "73">For example, if the character.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "74">sequence is ABAB: the frequencies of A, B, and AB are all 2; and the frequencies of ABAB, ABA, BAB, and BA are all 1.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "75">2. The number of character sequences of the same length.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "76">For example, if the.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "77">character sequence is ABC: the sequences of length 1 are A, B, and C; the sequences of length 2 are AB and BC; and the sequence of length 3 is ABC itself.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "78">Therefore, the number of the sequences of length 1, 2, and 3 are 3, 2, and 1, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "79">Furthermore, there are three other quantities that can be calculated according to those just mentioned: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "80">The average frequency of character sequences of the same length.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "81">For.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "82">example, there are only two sequences of length 1: A and B. The frequencies of A and B are 2 and 8, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "83">Therefore, the arithmetic mean of frequencies of A and B is 5.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "84">In other words, the average frequency of character sequences of length 1 is 5.</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "85">2. The entropy of Sequence Plus One (SP1) of a character sequence.</S>
			<S sid ="133" ssid = "86">For.</S>
			<S sid ="134" ssid = "87">example, consider the character sequence X. The SP1 of X is a set, and each member of the SP1 contains X and one character.</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "88">In detail, the entropy Figure 2 A character sequence and its subsequence pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="136" ssid = "89">425 mentioned here is denoted by H(SP1L(X)) and H(SP1R(X)), where SP1L (SP1 Left) and SP1R (SP1 Right) are two subsets of SP1.</S>
			<S sid ="137" ssid = "90">In other words, SP1L(X) and SP1R(X) mean that the left side of X is attached with one character and the right side of X is attached with one character, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="138" ssid = "91">For example, there are several character sequences: BC, ABC, BBC, BCD, and BCB.</S>
			<S sid ="139" ssid = "92">ABC and BBC are the members of SP1L(BC), whereas BCD and BCB are the members of SP1R(BC).</S>
			<S sid ="140" ssid = "93">Therefore, H(SP1L(BC)) is calculated according to the frequencies of ABC, BBC, and other members of SP1L(BC), whereas H(SP1R(BC)) is calculated according to the frequencies of BCD, BCB, and other members of SP1R(BC).</S>
			<S sid ="141" ssid = "94">The formal descriptions of SP1L and SP1R are SP1L(x) = {s|s = c · x, s ∈ S, x ∈ S, c ∈ Σ} (1) and SP1R(x) = {s|s = x · c, s ∈ S, x ∈ S, c ∈ Σ} (2) respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="142" ssid = "95">The symbol · denotes the attachment operator; s denotes a subsequence of the character sequence S; c denotes a character in the alphabet Σ.</S>
			<S sid ="143" ssid = "96">In fact, x is the largest proper subsequence of s. 3.</S>
			<S sid ="144" ssid = "97">The average entropies of SP1s of character sequences of the same length..</S>
			<S sid ="145" ssid = "98">The SP1s refer to both SP1Ls and SP1Rs.</S>
			<S sid ="146" ssid = "99">For example, there are only three character sequences of length 2: AB, BC, and CD.</S>
			<S sid ="147" ssid = "100">Therefore, the sum of H(SP1L(AB)), H(SP1L(BC)), and H(SP1L(CD)) is the numerator of the arithmetic mean, and the denominator is 3.</S>
			<S sid ="148" ssid = "101">The arithmetic mean is the average entropies of SP1Ls of AB, BC, and CD.</S>
			<S sid ="149" ssid = "102">We directly use the preﬁx tree (trie) (Fredkin 1960) to record the information.</S>
			<S sid ="150" ssid = "103">Some other data structures can also be used (Morrison 1968; McCreight 1976; Manber and Myers 1990).</S>
			<S sid ="151" ssid = "104">2.1.3 The Calculation of Goodness.</S>
			<S sid ="152" ssid = "105">The IV of a character sequence is formulated as IV(x) = ( Fx FML )L (3) The superscript L is the exponent; x is the character sequence to be evaluated; L is the length of x. F denotes the frequency of a character sequence, and therefore Fx is that of x; FM denotes the average frequency of character sequences of the same length, and therefore FML is that of length L. F can be viewed as a local variable, and FM brings global effects to the formula.</S>
			<S sid ="153" ssid = "106">By the division in IV, the character sequences of different lengths become comparable with each other.</S>
			<S sid ="154" ssid = "107">The division is based on a pattern called Balancing, which means keeping balance between the local and global effects.</S>
			<S sid ="155" ssid = "108">Furthermore, FM is formulated as FML = 1 FL (4) N 426 The entropies of SP1L and SP1R are formulated as H(SP1L(x)) = − n i=1 p(FLxi ) ln p(FLxi ) (5) and H(SP1R(x)) = − n i=1 p(FRxi ) ln p(FRxi ) (6) respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="156" ssid = "109">Lxi and Rxi denote the ith members in SP1L(x) and SP1R(x), respectively; FLx and FRx denote the frequencies of members in SP1L(x) and SP1R(x), respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="157" ssid = "110">The average entropies of SP1Ls and SP1Rs of character sequences of the same length are formulated as HLM = 1 N HLL (7) N and HRM = 1 N HR L (8) N respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "111">HLM and HRM denote the average entropies of SP1Ls and SP1Rs of character sequences of certain length, respectively; HL and HR denote the entropies of SP1L and SP1R of a character sequence of a certain length, respectively; N is the number of HL or HR; L is the length of character sequences.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "112">The CV of a pair of adjacent subsequences is formulated as CV(Sleft · Sright ) = IV(Sleft ) × IV(Sright ) × LRV(Sleft · Sright ) (9) where the LRV is formulated as qH(SP1R(Sleft )) × H(SP1L(Sright )) x LRV(Sleft · Sright ) = ( HRML1 ) × HLML2 (10) The superscript x is the exponent; The symbol · denotes that Sleft and Sright are two adjacent sequences; L1 and L2 denote the lengths of character sequences in SP1R(Sleft ) and SP1L(Sright ), respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "113">Actually, L1 and L2 are equal to the lengths of Sleft + 1 and Sright + 1, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "114">The division in LRV represents a Balancing process.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "115">As before, the entropies of SP1s of character sequences of different lengths become comparable with each other by using Balancing.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "116">IV and LRV represent certainty and uncertainty of co-occurrence of two adjacent character sequences, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "117">Their combination is CV.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "118">The exponent in LRV represents the weight of LRV in CV.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "119">427 2.2 Selection.</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "120">Selection is the phase in which a maximization strategy is used to determine the best segmentation of a character sequence.</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "121">For example, the character sequence ABC has six subsequences: A, B, C, AB, BC, and ABC.</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "122">Therefore, ABC can be divided into various pairs of adjacent subsequences, as shown in Figure 3.</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "123">The process of Selection can be viewed as the sets of comparisons.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "124">Each set consists of all comparisons between a character sequence itself and all pairs of adjacent subsequences of the character sequence.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "125">In Figure 3, the character sequence BC is compared with the pair of adjacent subsequences B · C. If the CV of B · C is higher than the IV of BC, BC will be segmented into B and C. Processing the longer sequence is done in a similar manner.</S>
			<S sid ="173" ssid = "126">For example, ABC has two adjacent subsequence pairs: A · BC and AB · C. Both BC and AB have their own adjacent subsequence pairs B · C and A · B, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="174" ssid = "127">Therefore, Selection must process BC and AB before processing ABC.</S>
			<S sid ="175" ssid = "128">The IV of ABC, the CV of A · BC, and the CV of AB · C are compared with each other after Selection ﬁnishes processing both BC and AB.</S>
			<S sid ="176" ssid = "129">The one with the highest goodness value is the ﬁnal choice.</S>
			<S sid ="177" ssid = "130">We adopt a dynamic programming technique to limit the computational complexity of the algorithm in Selection.</S>
			<S sid ="178" ssid = "131">Therefore, the algorithm takes polynomial time over the length of the character sequence being processed.</S>
			<S sid ="179" ssid = "132">2.2.1 The Primary Criterion and Secondary Criteria.</S>
			<S sid ="180" ssid = "133">The task of Selection is to maximize the goodness value, which can be deﬁned as seg∗ = argmax E(seg) (11) seg where seg denotes all possible segmentations of a character sequence, seg* denotes the ﬁnally selected segmentation, and E denotes an evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "134">Figure 3 The pairs of adjacent subsequences.</S>
			<S sid ="182" ssid = "135">428 For a character sequence and its pairs of adjacent subsequences, Selection is further formulated as where E(Si ) = S∗ = argmax E(Si ) (12) 0 ≤ i ≤ N (IV(S0 ) i= 0, (13) CV(Si ) 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 1.</S>
			<S sid ="183" ssid = "136">S0 is the character sequence and N is its length; Si (1≤i≤N − 1) is the pair of adjacent subsequences in S0 , where the second subsequence starts at i. The evaluations for a character sequence and a pair of adjacent subsequences are IV and CV, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="184" ssid = "137">The combination of IV and CV is the primary criterion in Selection.</S>
			<S sid ="185" ssid = "138">Besides the primary criterion, it is necessary to provide a mechanism for making the decision when the primary criterion cannot resolve it.</S>

			<S sid ="202" ssid = "155">Our idea is that the result of the previous Selection is based on the overestimation of frequencies of some character sequences.</S>
			<S sid ="203" ssid = "156">For example, when the character sequence X is selected as a word after Selection, the original frequencies of X’s proper subsequences are considered as being overestimated because all of them were regarded as potential words before the Selection.</S>

			<S sid ="205" ssid = "158">Therefore, the frequencies of these subsequences are reduced, and Adjustment can be viewed as the corrections to the overestimated frequencies.</S>
			<S sid ="206" ssid = "159">In our example, the character sequence ABC occurs twice in an input, as shown in Figure 6.</S>
			<S sid ="207" ssid = "160">After Selection, one of the ABCs is selected as a word but not the other.</S>

			<S sid ="209" ssid = "162">This process reminds us of Statistical Substring Reduction (SSR) (Zhang et al. 2003; Lu¨ , Zhang, and Hu 2004), although the idea of SSR is not similar to ours.</S>

			<S sid ="264" ssid = "217">When the current result of segmentation is the same as the previous result, or ESA reaches a given number of iterations, ESA stops.</S>
			<S sid ="265" ssid = "218">Otherwise, ESA repeats the process from Step 1.</S>
			<S sid ="266" ssid = "219">Preprocessing has two steps: Step 1: Segment a corpus into multiple character sequences.</S>
			<S sid ="267" ssid = "220">No character sequence exceeds the limit of maximum length.</S>
			<S sid ="268" ssid = "221">Step 2: The frequencies (F in IV) of all subsequences in every character sequence are recorded.</S>

			<S sid ="275" ssid = "228">IV is an exponential formula.</S>
			<S sid ="276" ssid = "229">The base is a ratio, which represents the inﬂuence of a segment on the goodness of segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="277" ssid = "230">The exponent is the length of the segment, which means that each character in the segment has an equal inﬂuence on the goodness.</S>
			<S sid ="278" ssid = "231">433 LRV is also an exponential formula.</S>
			<S sid ="279" ssid = "232">The base is the product of two ratios, which represents the inﬂuence of the gap between two adjacent segments on the goodness of segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="280" ssid = "233">The exponent is the weight needed to harmonize the inﬂuences of IV and LRV in CV.</S>
			<S sid ="281" ssid = "234">CV is the combination of IV and LRV.</S>
			<S sid ="282" ssid = "235">The whole goodness of segmentation can be viewed as nested CVs.</S>
			<S sid ="283" ssid = "236">For example, the character sequence ABC is segmented into A B C. The whole goodness is equivalent to CV(A · B · C) = IV(A) × CV(B · C) × LRV(A · BC) (16) or CV(A · B · C) = CV(A · B) × IV(C) × LRV(AB · C) (17) Although the character sequence can possibly be segmented in a different order, the whole goodness is equivalent to CV(A · B · C) = IV(A) × IV(B) × IV(C) × LRV(A · BC) × LRV(AB · C) (18) Therefore, the design of CV ensures the consistency of the goodness measurement across different orders of segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="284" ssid = "237">By using the length as the exponent of IV, CV has a feature.</S>
			<S sid ="285" ssid = "238">For example, the character sequence ABC can be segmented into A B C, AB C, A BC, and ABC.</S>
			<S sid ="286" ssid = "239">The products of IVs in the nested CVs are FA FB FC FM1 × FM1 × FM1 (19) FAB FAB FC FM2 × FM2 × FM1 (20) FA FBC FBC FM1 × FM2 × FM2 (21) FABC FABC FABC FM3 × FM3 × FM3 (22) No matter how it is segmented, the inﬂuence of each character is equally considered.</S>
			<S sid ="287" ssid = "240">The idea of ESA is to introduce few manually assigned parameters when using the unannotated corpora alone.</S>
			<S sid ="288" ssid = "241">The only parameter in ESA is the exponent in LRV, which can be predicted with the empirical formulae.</S>
			<S sid ="289" ssid = "242">We think that a completely unsupervised approach to word segmentation should be tested with the closed criterion in Bakeoff.</S>
			<S sid ="290" ssid = "243">Furthermore, there are three reasons why the approach should not depend on punctuation to segment sentences: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="291" ssid = "244">Although punctuation is easily identiﬁed with encoding information, it.</S>
			<S sid ="292" ssid = "245">cannot be identiﬁed when lacking such information.</S>
			<S sid ="293" ssid = "246">434 2.</S>
			<S sid ="294" ssid = "247">Segmenting sentences with punctuation is based on the assumption that a. language must have punctuation.</S>
			<S sid ="295" ssid = "248">In fact, some languages, such as ancient Chinese, have no such symbols.</S>
			<S sid ="296" ssid = "249">This phenomenon even partly exists in modern Chinese, which implies a lack of delimiters between words.</S>
			<S sid ="297" ssid = "250">3.</S>
			<S sid ="298" ssid = "251">The completely unsupervised approach should have more abilities to.</S>
			<S sid ="299" ssid = "252">process unfamiliar languages, because this kind of approach is similar to the infant language learner without prior knowledge such as lexicons, annotated corpora, and character information.</S>
			<S sid ="300" ssid = "253">The completely unsupervised approach should discover new knowledge instead of just using it.</S>

			<S sid ="321" ssid = "274">The result with this setting demonstrates that discriminating non-Chinese characters from Chinese ones can further improve the accuracy.</S>

			<S sid ="324" ssid = "277">The unsupervised approaches are not comparable with supervised.</S>

			<S sid ="329" ssid = "282">some extent.</S>
			<S sid ="330" ssid = "283">This is not only because the researchers carried out their experiments on different corpora and with test settings, but also because the different approaches may be adapted to different applications (Sproat and Shih 2001; Sproat and Emerson 2003; Wu 2003; Gao et al. 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="331" ssid = "284">Zhao (2009) even suggested that character-level analysis could replace word-level analysis for Chinese.</S>
			<S sid ="332" ssid = "285">However, we think that making comparisons based on similar corpora and settings with other approaches is necessary when regarding word segmentation as an independent task.</S>

			<S sid ="427" ssid = "4">A statistical approach was proposed by Teahan et al.</S>
			<S sid ="428" ssid = "5">(2000) (TH), which is based on the partial matching (PPM) symbol-wise compression scheme.</S>
			<S sid ="429" ssid = "6">The approach consists of multiple order models and an escape strategy that is used to transition from the higher order model to the lower one.</S>
			<S sid ="430" ssid = "7">The approach calculates the escape probabilities and the probabilities of successive characters according to the training corpus that is manually segmented.</S>
			<S sid ="431" ssid = "8">Therefore, TH is a supervised approach.</S>
			<S sid ="432" ssid = "9">Iterative Word Segmentation and Likelihood Ratio Ranking (IWSLRR) (Chang and Su 1997) is an iterative process that uses both certainty and uncertainty information (MI and entropy, respectively).</S>
			<S sid ="433" ssid = "10">The approach segments words according to an augmented dictionary and adds potential words to the dictionary.</S>
			<S sid ="434" ssid = "11">The program consists of a segmentation module and a ﬁltering module.</S>
			<S sid ="435" ssid = "12">The augmented dictionary consists of a system dictionary and the potential words.</S>
			<S sid ="436" ssid = "13">The system dictionary stores the known words given as prior knowledge.</S>
			<S sid ="437" ssid = "14">The potential words are produced by merging and ﬁltering.</S>
			<S sid ="438" ssid = "15">MI and entropy are combined by Gaussian mixture in the ﬁltering algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="439" ssid = "16">The ﬁltering algorithm uses a threshold to make the choice for the potential words.</S>
			<S sid ="440" ssid = "17">In Chang and Su (1997), the system dictionary was the combination of two dictionaries.</S>
			<S sid ="441" ssid = "18">446 Figure 13 The time complexity in practice (4 samples: 10, 30, 50, and 100).</S>
			<S sid ="442" ssid = "19">In addition, their approach extracted the potential words from unannotated corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="443" ssid = "20">Therefore, IWSLRR is semi-supervised.</S>
			<S sid ="444" ssid = "21">Whereas ESA is completely unsupervised, both IWSLRR and ESA use the combination of certainty and uncertainty.</S>
			<S sid ="445" ssid = "22">MI and entropy are the measures of two kinds of information in IWSLRR, whereas ESA uses IV and LRV.</S>
			<S sid ="446" ssid = "23">ESA directly multiplies IV and LRV to combine them, unlike IWSLRR, which uses Gaussian mixture.</S>

			<S sid ="448" ssid = "25">The algorithm ﬁnds the best substitutes for certain sequences to reduce the description length calculated by the encoding algorithms.</S>
			<S sid ="449" ssid = "26">The DLG value is negative when replacing the one-character sequence.</S>
			<S sid ="450" ssid = "27">Therefore DLG cannot uniformly process words of different lengths.</S>
			<S sid ="451" ssid = "28">That is to say, DLG needs an additional strategy to process one-character words, whereas ESA uniformly processes words of different lengths.</S>
			<S sid ="452" ssid = "29">TONGO (Threshold and maximum for n-grams that overlap) (Ando and Lee 2000, 2003) counts non-straddling strings on two sides of potential boundaries and straddling strings containing the potential boundaries.</S>

			<S sid ="454" ssid = "31">The sum of goodness values produced from the comparisons is called the “total vote.” If the “total vote” is the local maximum or exceeds a threshold, the location of the boundary 447 will be determined.</S>
			<S sid ="455" ssid = "32">The algorithm uses held-out data sets to estimate the maximum order of n-grams and the threshold.</S>
			<S sid ="456" ssid = "33">The held-out data sets are manually annotated.</S>
			<S sid ="457" ssid = "34">Therefore, TONGO is semi-supervised.</S>
			<S sid ="458" ssid = "35">The non-straddling and straddling strings can be viewed as uncertainty and certainty, respectively.</S>

			<S sid ="470" ssid = "47">The pruning algorithm uses two thresholds that are manually assigned, and the validation corpus is manually annotated.</S>
			<S sid ="471" ssid = "48">Therefore, SS is semi-supervised.</S>
			<S sid ="472" ssid = "49">The word candidates represent certainty and MI is used to measure uncertainty.</S>
			<S sid ="473" ssid = "50">These two kinds of information are independently considered by SS, whereas ESA uses a different method to combine them.</S>

			<S sid ="480" ssid = "57">VE independently processes the two kinds of information, whereas ESA combines them in CV.</S>
			<S sid ="481" ssid = "58">Accessor Variety (AV) (Feng et al. 2004a, 2004b) uses uncertainty between a string and its adjacent characters to assess the string’s independence of its context.</S>
