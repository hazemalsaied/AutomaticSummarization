			<S sid ="42" ssid = "7">We defined a statistical word model to assign a reasonable word probability to an arbitrary substring in the input sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "8">It is formally defined as the joint probability of the character sequence c1•..c c if Wi is a.n unknown word.</S>

			<S sid ="65" ssid = "1">3.1 Longest Match.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "2">We can get a set of initial estimates of the word frequencies by segmenting the training corpus using a heuristic (non-stochastic) dictionary-based word segmenter.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "3">In both Japanese and Chinese, one of the most popular non-stochastic dictionary-based approaches is the longest match method 1.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "4">There are many variations of the longest match method, possibly augmented with further heuristics.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "5">We used a simple greedy algorithm described in [Sproat et al., 1996].</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "6">It starts at the beginning of the sentence, finds the longest word starting at that point, and then repeats the process starting at the next character until the end of the sentence is reached.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "7">We chose the greedy algorithm because it is easy to implement and guaranteed to produce only one segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "8">3.2 String Frequency.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "9">[Sproat et al., 1996] also proposed another method to estimate a set of initial word frequencies without segmenting the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "10">It derives the initial estimates from the frequencies in the corpus of the strings of character making up each word in the dictionary whether or not each string is actually an instance of the word in question.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "11">The total number of words in the corpus is derived simply by summing the string frequency of each word in the dictionary.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "12">Finding (and counting) all instances of a string W in a large text T can be efficiently accomplished by making a data structure known as a suffix array, which is basically a. sorted list of all the suffixes ofT [Ma.nber and Myers, 1993].</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "13">3.3 Longest Match String Frequency.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "14">The estimates of word frequencies by the above string frequency method tend to inflate a lot especially in short words, because of double counts.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "15">We devised a slightly improved version which we term the &quot;longest match string frequency&quot; method.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "16">It counts the instances of string W1in text T, unless the instance is also a substring of another string W2 in dictionary D. This method can be implemented by making two suffix arrays, ST and SD for text T and dictionary D. By using ST, we first make list Lw of all occurrences of string Win the text.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "17">By using SD, we then look up all strings Win the dictionary that include Was a substring, and make list Lw of all their occurrences in the text by using ST. The longest match string frequency of word W in text T with respect to dictionary D is obtained by counting the number of elements in the set difference LwLw For example, if the input sentence is &quot; 11!iilli :fti;::-?\-&apos;&quot;Cli!-&apos;!1.</S>

			<S sid ="83" ssid = "19">Figure 3 shows the difference of the three methods.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "20">The longest match string frequency (lsf) method considers all possible longest matches in the text, while the greedy longest match (lm) algorithm considers only one possibility.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "21">It is obvious that the longest match string frequency method remedies the problem that the string frequency (sf) method consistently and inappropriately favors short words.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "22">The problem of the longest match string frequency method is that if a word W1 is a substring of other word w2 and if wl always appears as a substring of w2 in the training text, just like m 1Although (Sproat et al., 1996] calls it &quot;maximum matching&quot;, we call this method &quot;longest match&quot; according to a review on Chinese word segmentation [Wu and Tseng, 1993) and the literal translation of the Japanese name of the method Hi!:.</S>

			<S sid ="89" ssid = "1">To a first approximation, a point in the text where character type changes is likely to be a word boundary.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "2">This is a popular heuristics in Japanese word segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "3">To help readers understand the heuristics, we have to give a. brief introduction to the Japanese writing system.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "4">In contemporary Japanese, there are at least five different types of characters other than punc­ tuation marks: kanji, hiragana, kata.kana, Roman alphabet, and Arabic numeral.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "5">Kanji which means &apos;Chinese character&apos; is used for both Chinese origin words and Japanese words semantically equivalent to Chinese characters.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "6">There are two syllabaries hiragana and katakana.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "7">The former is used primarily for grammatical function words, such as particles and inflectional endings, while the latter is used primarily to transliterate Western origin words.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "8">Roman alphabet is also used for Western origin words and acronyms.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "9">Arabic numeral is used for numbers.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "10">By using just this character type heuristics, a non-stochastic and non-dictionary word segmenter can be made.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "11">In fact, using the estimated word frequencies obtained by the heuristics results in poor segmentation accuracy 2 • We found, however, that it is very effective to use the character type based word segmenter as a lexical acquisition tool to augment the initial word list.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "12">The initial word identification procedure is as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "13">First, we segment the training corpus by the character type based word segmenter, and make a list of words with frequencies.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "14">We then filter out hiragana strings because they are likely to be function words.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "15">We add the extracted word 2The word segmentation accuracy of the c:haracter type based method was less than 60%, while other estimation methods achieves around 7080% M we show in the next section.</S>

			<S sid ="105" ssid = "17">Although there are a lot of erroneous words in the augmented word list, most of them are filtered out by the re-estimation.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "18">This method works surprisingly well, as shown in the experiment.</S>

			<S sid ="199" ssid = "93">To investigate the effect of re-estimation, we tested the combination of three initial word lists: Dl, D2, DlOO, and two initial word frequency estimation methods: string frequency method (sf) and longest match string frequency method augmented with the word identification method (lsf+ct).</S>
			<S sid ="200" ssid = "94">We applied the Viterbi re-estimation procedure three times.</S>
			<S sid ="201" ssid = "95">It seems further re-estimation brings no significant change.</S>
			<S sid ="202" ssid = "96">At each stage of re-estimation, we measured the word segmentation accuracy on the test sentences (not the training texts!).</S>
			<S sid ="203" ssid = "97">Figure 5 shows the word segmentation accuracy, the number of word tokens in the training texts, and the number of word types in the dictionary at each stage of re-estimation.</S>
			<S sid ="204" ssid = "98">In general, re-estimation has little impact on word segmentation accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="205" ssid = "99">It gradually improves the accuracy when the initial word list is relatively large (Dl and D2), while it worsen the accuracy a little when the initial word list is relatively small (DlOO).</S>
			<S sid ="206" ssid = "100">This might correspond with the results on unsupervised learning performed by an English part of speech tagger.</S>
			<S sid ="207" ssid = "101">Although [Kupiec, 19921 presented a very sophisticated method of unsupervised learning, [Elworthy, 19941 reported that re-estimation is not always helpful.</S>
			<S sid ="208" ssid = "102">We think, however, our results are because we used a word unigra.m model; it is too early to conclude that re-estimation is useless for word segmentation, as discussed in the next section.</S>

			<S sid ="224" ssid = "1">6.1 The Nature of the Word Unigram Model.</S>
			<S sid ="225" ssid = "2">First, we will clarify the nature of the word unigra.m model.</S>
			<S sid ="226" ssid = "3">ROughly speaking, word Ulligram based word segmenters maximize the product of the word frequencies under the fewest word principle which subsumes the longest match principle.</S>
			<S sid ="227" ssid = "4">If two word segmentation hypotheses differs in the number of words, the one with fewer words is almost always selected.</S>
			<S sid ="228" ssid = "5">For example, the input string is c1c2 and the dictionary includes three words C1C2, c1, c2• To prefer segmentation hypothesis c11c2 over c1c2, the following relation must hold.</S>
			<S sid ="229" ssid = "6">(8) where C(·) represents the word frequency and N is the number of word tokens in the training text.</S>
			<S sid ="230" ssid = "7">Suppose N is one million.</S>
			<S sid ="231" ssid = "8">Even if C(c1c2) = 1; c1c2 is preferred unless c1 and c2 are highly frequent, say C(c1) C(c2) &gt; 1000.</S>
			<S sid ="232" ssid = "9">It is obvious that the segmentatiOn with fewer words are preferred.</S>
			<S sid ="233" ssid = "10">If two word segmentation hypotheses have the same number of words, the one with larger product of word frequencies is selected.</S>
			<S sid ="234" ssid = "11">For example, the input string is C1C2C3 and the dictionary includes four words c1c2, ca, c1, c2ca.</S>
			<S sid ="235" ssid = "12">To prefer segmentation hypothesis c1c2lca over c1lc2ca, the following relation must hold.</S>
			<S sid ="236" ssid = "13">C(c1c2) C(cs) C(c1) C(c2ca) N N &lt; N N (9) Since the denominator N is cancelled, it is obvious that the segmentation with larger product of frequencies is preferred.</S>
			<S sid ="237" ssid = "14">6.2 Classification of Segmentation Errors.</S>
			<S sid ="238" ssid = "15">There are three major types of segmentation errors.</S>
			<S sid ="239" ssid = "16">The first type is not an error but the ambiguity resulting from inconsistent manual segmentation, or the intrinsic indeterminacy of Japanese word segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="240" ssid = "17">For example, in the manually segmented corpus, we found the string OO.A. Ifl1!i&apos;&quot; (foreign laborer) is identified as one word in some places while in others it is divided into two words OO.A.</S>
			<S sid ="241" ssid = "18">(foreigner) and lfl1!i&apos;&quot; (laborer).</S>
			<S sid ="242" ssid = "19">However, the word unigram based segmenter consistently identifies it as a single word.</S>
			<S sid ="243" ssid = "20">We assume 35 % of the segmentation &quot;errors&quot; belong to this type.</S>
			<S sid ="244" ssid = "21">The second type is breakdown of unknown words.</S>
			<S sid ="245" ssid = "22">For example, the word k:P (funny) is segmented into two word hypotheses (rare) and 1!!P (strange).</S>
			<S sid ="246" ssid = "23">This is because 1!!P is included in the dictionary.</S>
			<S sid ="247" ssid = "24">When a substring of an unknown word coincides with other word in the dictionary, it is very likely to be broken down into the dictionary word and the remaining substring.</S>
			<S sid ="248" ssid = "25">This is a major flaw of our word model using character unigram.</S>
			<S sid ="249" ssid = "26">It assigns too little probability to longer word hypotheses, especially more than three characters.</S>
			<S sid ="250" ssid = "27">The third type is erroneous longest match.</S>
			<S sid ="251" ssid = "28">This happens frequently at the sequence of gram-_ matical function words written in hiragana.</S>
			<S sid ="252" ssid = "29">For example, the phrase -;; (gather) I -:&gt; (INFL) j-c (and) I (come) I t::.</S>
			<S sid ="253" ssid = "30">(past-AUXV), which means &quot;came and gathered&quot;, is segmented into** I -c (TOPIC) I t (north), because the number of words is fewer.</S>
			<S sid ="254" ssid = "31">The larger the initial word list is, the more often a hiragana word happens to coincide with a sequence of other hiragana words, because the number of character types in hirago.na is small ( &lt; 100).</S>
			<S sid ="255" ssid = "32">This is the major reason why word segmentation accuracy levels off or decreases at a certain point, as the size of the initial word list increases.</S>
			<S sid ="256" ssid = "33">6.3 Classification of tbe Effects of Re-estimation.</S>
			<S sid ="257" ssid = "34">There are two types of major changes in segmentation with re-estimation: word boundary adjust­ ment and subdivision.</S>
			<S sid ="258" ssid = "35">The former moves a word boundary keeping the number of words unchanged.</S>
			<S sid ="259" ssid = "36">The latter break down a word into two or more words.</S>
			<S sid ="260" ssid = "37">Re-estimation usually improves a sequence of grammatical function words written in hiragana at the sentence final predicate phrase if the initial segmentation and the correct segmentation have the same number of words.</S>
			<S sid ="261" ssid = "38">For example, the incorrect initial segmentation :il:tt.</S>
			<S sid ="262" ssid = "39">(take away) I :tt.</S>
			<S sid ="263" ssid = "40">(INFL + passive-AUXV) I t -;; (ball) I -;;t!</S>
			<S sid ="264" ssid = "41">(not yet) is correctly adjusted to :il:tt.</S>
			<S sid ="265" ssid = "42">(take away) I h (INFL + passive-AUXV) I t (past-AUXV) I -;;-;; (still) I tt.</S>
			<S sid ="266" ssid = "43">(COPULA), which means &quot;still be taken away&quot;.</S>
			<S sid ="267" ssid = "44">Re-estimation subdivides an erroneous longest match if the frequencies of the shorter words are significantly large.</S>
			<S sid ="268" ssid = "45">For example, the incorrect initial segmentation .:t (restrain) 1 t::.\-&apos; (sea bream) is correctly subdivided into *.</S>
			<S sid ="269" ssid = "46">(restrain)I t:.</S>
			<S sid ="270" ssid = "47">(want-AUXV) I lt&apos; (INFL), which means &quot;want to restrain&quot;.</S>
			<S sid ="271" ssid = "48">One of the most frequent undesirable effects of re-estimation is subdividing an infrequent word into highly frequent words, or a frequent word and an unknown word.</S>
			<S sid ="272" ssid = "49">For example, the correct infrequent word li (ambassador) is subdivided into two frequent words, (use-ROOT) and ill (node).</S>
			<S sid ="273" ssid = "50">As we sa.id before, one of the major virtues of re-estimation is its ability to remove inappropriate word hypotheses generated by the initial word identification procedure.</S>
			<S sid ="274" ssid = "51">For example, from the phrase &gt;&apos;li (Soviet Union) I (made-SUFFIX) I Tetllr (tank), which means &quot;Soviet Union-made tank&quot;, the initial word identifier extracts two word hypotheses &gt;&apos; and retllr, where the former is written in katakana and the latter is written in kanji.</S>
			<S sid ="275" ssid = "52">H &gt;&apos;it and !lll!</S>
			<S sid ="276" ssid = "53">is in the dictionary, the two erroneous word hypotheses Y and lll!!lll!TStlli are removed and the correct word JAl]J is added to the dictionary after re-estimation.</S>
			<S sid ="277" ssid = "54">1 Conclusion and Future Work.</S>
			<S sid ="278" ssid = "55">We have presented a self-organized method that builds a stochastic Japanese word segmenter from a small word list and a large unsegmented text.</S>
			<S sid ="279" ssid = "56">We found that it is very effective to augment the initial word list with automatically extracted words using character type heuristics.</S>
			<S sid ="280" ssid = "57">Re-estimation helps in adjusting word frequencies and removing inappropriate word hypotheses, although it has little impact on word segmentation accuracy if the word unigram model is used.</S>
			<S sid ="281" ssid = "58">The major drawbacks of the current word segmenter is its breakdown of unknown words whose substrings coincide with other words in the dictionary, and the erroneous longest match at the sequence of functional words written in hiragana.</S>
			<S sid ="282" ssid = "59">The first drawback results from the character unigram based word model that prefers short words, while the second drawback results from the nature of the word unigram model which prefers fewest words segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="283" ssid = "60">One may argue that we could use the word bigram model.</S>
			<S sid ="284" ssid = "61">However, we don&apos;t know how we can estimate the initial word bigram frequencies from scratch.</S>
			<S sid ="285" ssid = "62">One may also argue that we could use the character bigram in the word model.</S>
			<S sid ="286" ssid = "63">However, the character bigram for the word model must be computed from segmented texts.</S>
			<S sid ="287" ssid = "64">Both of these suggest that we need a word segmenter to build a more sophisticated word segmenter.</S>
			<S sid ="288" ssid = "65">Therefore, as a next step of our research, we are thinking of using the proposed unigram based word segmenter to obtain the initial estimates of the word bigrams a.nd the word-based character bigrams which will then be refined by a re-estimation procedure.</S>
