			<S sid="7" ssid="7">The difficulty of achieving adequate hand&#194;&#173; crafted semantic representations has limited the field of natural language processing to applica&#194;&#173; sons that can be contained within well-defined domains . </S>

			<S sid="11" ssid="11">One of the most controversial areas has to do with polygamy . </S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="12">What constitutes a clear sepa&#194;&#173; ration into senses for any one verb , and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished ? </S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">The answer to this question is the key to breaking the bottleneck of semantic representation that is currently the single great&#194;&#173; est limitation on the general application of nat&#194;&#173; Ural language processing techniques . </S>

			<S sid="15" ssid="15">We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes , inter&#194;&#173; section Levin classes , as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts . </S>

	<SECTION number="2" title="Classifying verbs. ">
			<S sid="20" ssid="1">Two current approaches to English verb classi&#194;&#173; fictions are WordNet ( Miller et al. , 1990 ) and Levin classes ( Levin , 1993 ) . </S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="2">WordNet is an on&#194;&#173; line lexical database of English that currently contains approximately 120,000 sets of noun , verb , adjective , and adverb synonyms , each rep&#194;&#173; resenting a lexical concept . </S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="3">A sunset syn onyx set ) contains , besides all the word forms that can refer to a given concept , a definitional gloss and - in most cases - an example sentence . </S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="4">Words and sunsets are interrelated by means of lexical and semantic-conceptual links , respec&#194;&#173; lively . </S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="5">Antonym or semantic opposition links individual words , while the super-/subordinate relation links entire sunsets . </S>
			<S sid="25" ssid="6">WordNet was de&#194;&#173; signed principally as a semantic network , and contains little syntactic information . </S>
			<S sid="26" ssid="7">Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntac&#194;&#173; tic frames that are in some sense meaning pre&#194;&#173; serving ( diathesis alternations ) ( Levin , 1993 ) . </S>
			<S sid="27" ssid="8">The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class member&#194;&#173; ship . </S>
			<S sid="28" ssid="9">The fundamental assumption is that the syntactic frames are a direct reflection of the un&#194;&#173; underlying semantics . </S>
			<S sid="29" ssid="10">Levin classes are supposed to provide specific sets of syntactic frames that are associated with the individual classes . </S>
			<S sid="30" ssid="11">The sets of syntactic frames associated with a particular Levin class are not intended to be arbitrary , and they are supposed to reflect un&#194;&#173; underlying semantic components that constrain al&#194;&#173; losable arguments . </S>
			<S sid="31" ssid="12">For example , break verbs and cut verbs are similar in that they can all participate in the transitive and in the mid&#194;&#173; dle construction , John broke the window , Glass breaks easily , John cut the bread , This loaf cuts easily . </S>
			<S sid="32" ssid="13">However , only break verbs can also occur in the simple intransitive , The window broke , *The bread cut . </S>
			<S sid="33" ssid="14">In addition , cut verbs can oc&#194;&#173; cur in the donative John valiantly bushwhacked at the frozen loaf , but his knife was too dull to make a dent in it , whereas break verbs can not , *John broke at the window . </S>
			<S sid="34" ssid="15">The explanation given is that cut describes a series of actions di&#194;&#173; directed at achieving the goal of separating some object into pieces . </S>
			<S sid="35" ssid="16">It is possible for these ac&#194;&#173; sons to be performed without the end result being achieved , but where the cutting manner can still be recognized , i.e. , John cut at the loaf . </S>
			<S sid="36" ssid="17">Where break is concerned , the only thing speci&#194;&#173; fie is the resulting change of state where the object becomes separated into pieces . </S>
			<S sid="37" ssid="18">If the result is not achieved , there are no attempted breaking actions that can still be recognized . </S>
			<S sid="38" ssid="19">2.1 Ambiguities in Levin classes . </S>
			<S sid="39" ssid="20">It is not clear how much WordNet sunsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes , and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy ( Dorr and Jones , 1996 ) , ( Jones and Onyshkevych , 1997 ) , ( Dorr , 1997 ) . </S>
			<S sid="40" ssid="21">However , it would be useful for the WordNet senses to have access to the detailed syntactic information that the Levin classes contain , and it would be equally useful to have more guidance as to when membership in a Levin class does in fact indicate shared seman&#194;&#173; tic components . </S>
			<S sid="41" ssid="22">Of course , some Levin classes , such as braid ( bob , braid , brush , clip , cold cream comb , condition , crimp , crop , curl , etc . ) are clearly not intended to be synonymous , which at least partly explains the lack of overlap be&#194;&#173; tween Levin and WordNet . </S>
			<S sid="42" ssid="23">The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose . </S>
			<S sid="43" ssid="24">For in&#194;&#173; stance , carry verbs are described as not taking the donative *The mother carried at the baby , and yet many of the verbs in the carry class { push , pull , tug , shove , kick ) are also listed in the pushily class , which does take the cona&#194;&#173; tie . </S>
			<S sid="44" ssid="25">This listing of a verb in more than one class ( many verbs are in three or even four classes ) is left open to interpretation in Levin . </S>
			<S sid="45" ssid="26">Does it indicate that more than one sense of the verb is involved , or is one sense primary , and the alternations for that class should take precedence over the alternations for the other classes in which the verb is listed ? </S>
			<S sid="46" ssid="27">The grounds for deciding that a verb belongs in a particular class because of the alternations that it does not take are elusive at best . </S>

			<S sid="47" ssid="1">We augmented the existing database of Levin semantic classes with a set of intersection classes , which were created by grouping to&#194;&#173; ether subsets of existing classes with over&#194;&#173; lapping members . </S>
			<S sid="48" ssid="2">All subsets were included which shared a minimum of three members . </S>
			<S sid="49" ssid="3">If only one or two verbs were shared between two classes , we assumed this might be due to ho&#194;&#173; mo phony an idiosyncrasy involving individual verbs rather than a systematic relationship in&#194;&#173; voling coherent sets of verbs . </S>
			<S sid="50" ssid="4">This filter al&#194;&#173; lowed us to reject the potential intersection class that would have resulted from combining the re&#194;&#173; move verbs with the scribble verbs , for example . </S>

			<S sid="52" ssid="6">On the other hand , the scribble verbs do form an intersection class with the perfor&#194;&#173; dance verbs , since paint and write are also in both classes , in addition to draw . </S>

			<S sid="65" ssid="19">isolate semantic components Some of the large Levin classes comprise verbs that exhibit a wide range of possible semantic components , and could be divided into smaller subclasses . </S>
			<S sid="66" ssid="20">The split verbs ( cut , draw , kick , knock , push , rip , roll , shove , slip , split , etc . ) do not obviously form a homogeneous seman&#194;&#173; tic class . </S>
			<S sid="67" ssid="21">Instead , in their use as split verbs , each verb manifests an extended sense that can be paraphrased as `` separate by V-ing , '' where `` V '' is the basic meaning of that verb ( Levin , 1993 ) . </S>
			<S sid="68" ssid="22">Many of the verbs ( e.g. , draw , pull , push , shove , tug , yank ) that do not have an inherent semantic component of `` separating '' belong to this class because of the component of force in their meaning . </S>
			<S sid="69" ssid="23">They are interpretable as verbs of splitting or separating only in particular syn&#194;&#173; tactic frames ( I pulled the twig and the branch apart , I pulled the twig off { of ) the branch , but not *I pulled the twig and the branch ) . </S>
			<S sid="70" ssid="24">The ad&#194;&#173; junction of the apart adverb adds a change of state semantic component with respect to the object which is not present otherwise . </S>
			<S sid="71" ssid="25">These fringe split verbs appear in several other inter&#194;&#173; section classes that highlight the force aspect of their meaning . </S>

			<S sid="89" ssid="3">Although the Levin classes that make up an intersection class may have conflicting alterna&#194;&#173; sons e.g. , verbs of exerting force can take the donative alternation , while carry verbs can not ) , this does not invalidate the semantic regularity of the intersection class . </S>
			<S sid="90" ssid="4">As a verb of exerting force , push can appear in the donative son which emphasizes its force semantic com&#194;&#173; potent and ability to express an `` attempted '' action where any result that might be associ&#194;&#173; ated- with the verb ( e.g. , motion ) is not nec&#194;&#173; necessarily achieved ; as a carry verb ( used with a goal or directional phrase ) , push can not take the donative , which would conflict with the core meaning of the carry verb class ( i.e. , causation of motion ) . </S>
			<S sid="91" ssid="5">The critical point is that , while the verb 's meaning can be extended to either `` attempted '' action or directed motion , these two extensions can not co-occur - they are mutually exclusive . </S>
			<S sid="92" ssid="6">However the simultaneous potential of mutually exclusive extensions is not a problem . </S>
			<S sid="93" ssid="7">It is exactly those verbs that are triple-listed in the split/push/carry class ( which have force exertion as a semantic component ) that can take the donative . </S>
			<S sid="94" ssid="8">The carry verbs that are not in the intersection class ( carry , drag , haul , heft , hoist , lug , tote , tow ) are more `` pure '' examples of the carry class and always imply the achievement of causation of motion . </S>
			<S sid="95" ssid="9">Thus they can not take the donative alternation . </S>
			<S sid="96" ssid="10">3.2 Comparisons to WordNet . </S>
			<S sid="97" ssid="11">Even though the Levin verb classes are defined by their syntactic behavior , many reflect seman&#194;&#173; tic distinctions made by WordNet , a classifica&#194;&#173; son hierarchy defined in terms of purely se&#194;&#173; antic word relations ( synonyms , hypergamy etc . ) . </S>
			<S sid="98" ssid="12">When examining in detail the intersec&#194;&#173; tie classes just described , which emphasize not only the individual classes , but also their rela&#194;&#173; son to other classes , we see a rich semantic lat&#194;&#173; tic much like WordNet . </S>
			<S sid="99" ssid="13">This is exemplified by the Levin cut verbs and the intersection class formed by the cut verbs and split verbs . </S>
			<S sid="100" ssid="14">The original intersection class ( cut , hack , hew , saw ) exhibits alternations of both parent classes , and has been augmented with chip , clip , slash , snip since these cut verbs also display the syntactic properties of split verbs . </S>
			<S sid="101" ssid="15">WordNet distinguishes two subclasses of cut , differentiated by the type of result : 1 . </S>
			<S sid="102" ssid="16">Manner of cutting that results in separa&#194;&#173; . </S>
			<S sid="103" ssid="17">son into pieces ( chip , clip , cut , hack , hew , saw , slash , snip ) , having cut , separate with an instrument as an immediate hypergamy . </S>
			<S sid="104" ssid="18">2 . </S>
			<S sid="105" ssid="19">Manner of cutting that does n't separate . </S>
			<S sid="106" ssid="20">completely ( scrape , scratch ) , having cut into , incise as an immediate hypergamy which in turn has cut , separate with an in&#194;&#173; instrument as an immediate hypergamy </S>
			<S sid="107" ssid="21">This distinction appears in the second-order Levin classes as membership vs. nonmember&#194;&#173; ship in the intersection class with split . </S>
			<S sid="108" ssid="22">Levin verb classes are based on an underlying lat&#194;&#173; tic of partial semantic descriptions , which are manifested indirectly in diathesis alternations . </S>
			<S sid="109" ssid="23">Whereas high level semantic relations ( syn&#194;&#173; onyx hypergamy are represented directly in WordNet , they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes , as with the splitting class . </S>
			<S sid="110" ssid="24">However , other intersection classes , such as the split/push/carry class , are no more con&#194;&#173; consistent with WordNet than the original Levin classes . </S>
			<S sid="111" ssid="25">The most specific hypergamy common to all the verbs in this intersection class is move , displace , which is also a hypergamy for other carry verbs not in the intersection . </S>
			<S sid="112" ssid="26">In addition , only one verb ( pull ) has a WordNet sense cor&#194;&#173; responding to the change of state - separation semantic component associated with the split class . </S>
			<S sid="113" ssid="27">The fact that the split sense for these verbs does not appear explicitly in WordNet is not surprising since it is only an extended sense of the verbs , and separation is inferred only when the verb occurs with an appropriate adjunct , such as apart . </S>
			<S sid="114" ssid="28">However , apart can also be used with other classes of verbs , including many verbs of motion . </S>
			<S sid="115" ssid="29">To explicitly list separation as a possible sense for all these verbs would be extravagant when this sense can be gener&#194;&#173; ate from the combination of the adjunct with the force ( potential cause of change of physical state ) or motion ( itself a special kind of change of state , i.e. , of position ) semantic component of the verb . </S>
			<S sid="116" ssid="30">WordNet does not currently provide a consistent treatment of regular sense exten&#194;&#173; ion some are listed as separate senses , others are not mentioned at all ) . </S>
			<S sid="117" ssid="31">It would be straight&#194;&#173; forward to augment it with pointers indicating which senses are basic to a class of verbs and which can be generated automatically , and in&#194;&#173; clue corresponding syntactic information . </S>
			<S sid="118" ssid="32">3.3 Sense extension for manner of . </S>
			<S sid="119" ssid="33">motion Figure 3 shows intersection classes involving two classes of verbs of manner of motion ( run and roll verbs ) and a class of verbs of existence ( me&#194;&#173; under verbs ) . </S>
			<S sid="120" ssid="34">Roll and run verbs have seman&#194;&#173; tic components describing a manner of motion that typically , though not necessarily , involves change of location . </S>
			<S sid="121" ssid="35">In the absence of a goal or path adjunct they do not specify any direction of motion , and in some cases ( e.g. , float , bounce ) require the adjunct to explicitly specify any dis&#194;&#173; placement at all . </S>
			<S sid="122" ssid="36">The two classes differ in that roll verbs relate to manners of motion charac&#194;&#173; touristic of inanimate entities , while run verbs describe manners in which animate entities can move . </S>
			<S sid="123" ssid="37">Some manner of motion verbs allow a transitive alternation in addition to the basic in&#194;&#173; transitive . </S>
			<S sid="124" ssid="38">When a roll verb occurs in the tran&#194;&#173; transitive Bill moved the box across the room ) , the subject physically causes the object to move , whereas the subject of a transitive run verb merely induces the object to move ( the coach ran the athlete around the track ) . </S>
			<S sid="125" ssid="39">Some verbs can be used to describe motion of both animate and inanimate objects , and thus appear in both roll and run verb classes . </S>
			<S sid="126" ssid="40">The slide class parti&#194;&#173; sons this rolling intersection into verbs that can take the transitive alternation and verbs that can not ( drift and glide can not be causative , because they are not typically externally con&#194;&#173; controllable . </S>
			<S sid="127" ssid="41">Verbs in the slide/roll/run son are also allowed to appear in the dative alternation ( Carla slid the book to Dale , Carla slid Dale the book ) , in which the sense of change of location is extended to change of possession.When used intransitively with a path prepositional phrase , some of the manner of motion verbs can take on a sense of pseudo-motional existence , in which the subject does not actu&#194;&#173; ally move , but has a shape that could describe a path for the verb ( e.g. , The stream twists through the valley ) . </S>
			<S sid="128" ssid="42">These verbs are listed in the intersection classes with meander verbs of existence . </S>

			<S sid="130" ssid="44">The Portuguese verbs we examined behaved much more similarly to their English counter&#194;&#173; parts than we expected . </S>
			<S sid="131" ssid="45">Many of the verbs participate in alternations that are direct trans&#194;&#173; elations of the English alternations . </S>
			<S sid="132" ssid="46">However , there are some interesting differences in which sense extensions are allowed . </S>

			<S sid="134" ssid="48">We have made a preliminary study of the Por&#194;&#173; Portuguese translation of the carry verb class . </S>
			<S sid="135" ssid="49">As in English , these verbs seem to take different alter&#194;&#173; nations , and the ability of each to participate in an alternation is related to its semantic content . </S>
			<S sid="136" ssid="50">Table 1 shows how these Portuguese verbs natu&#194;&#173; rally cluster into two different subclasses , based on their ability to take the donative and apart alternations as well as path prepositions . </S>
			<S sid="137" ssid="51">These subclasses correspond very well to the English subclasses created by the intersection class . </S>

			<S sid="139" ssid="53">For ex&#194;&#173; ample , Eu puree o ram e o gal ho As in English , deriver and planar are not exter&#194;&#173; ally controllable actions and thus do n't take the causative alternation common to other verbs in the roll class . </S>
			<S sid="140" ssid="54">Planar does n't take a direct object in Portuguese , and it shows the induced action alternation the same way as flu&#194;&#173; char by using the light verb faze . </S>

			<S sid="146" ssid="60">Most verbs have more than one translation into Portuguese , so we chose the translation that best described the meaning or that had the same type of arguments as described in Levin 's verb classes . </S>
			<S sid="147" ssid="61">The elements of the slide/roll/run class are rebater ( bounce ) , flutter float ) , roar rolQ and desalinate slide ) . </S>
			<S sid="148" ssid="62">The consultative in Portuguese can not be expressed in the same way as in En&#194;&#173; English . </S>
			<S sid="149" ssid="63">It takes a gerund plus a reflexive , as in A port abridge The door slid opening itself ) . </S>
			<S sid="150" ssid="64">Transitivity is also not always preserved in the translations . </S>
			<S sid="151" ssid="65">For example , flutter does not take a direct object , so some of the alterna&#194;&#173; sons that are related to its transitive meaning are not present . </S>
			<S sid="152" ssid="66">For these verbs , we have the in&#194;&#173; duce action alternation by using the light verb faze make ) before the verb , as in Maria fez o Marco ( Mary floated the boat ) . </S>
			<S sid="153" ssid="67">As can be seen in Table 2 the alternations for the Portuguese translations of the verbs in this intersection class indicate that they share simi&#194;&#173; lar properties with the English verbs , including the causative . </S>
			<S sid="154" ssid="68">The exception to this , as just noted , is flutter float ) . </S>
			<S sid="155" ssid="69">The result of this is that statuary should move out of the slide class , which puts it with deriver drift ) and pla&#194;&#173; nar ( glide ) in the closely related rolling class . </S>

	<SECTION number="5" title="Discussion. ">
			<S sid="156" ssid="1">We have presented a refinement of Levin classes , intersection classes , and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses . </S>
			<S sid="157" ssid="2">Whereas each WordNet sunset is hierarchical ing to only one aspect ( e.g. , Result , in the case of cut ) , Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features , without designating one as primary . </S>
			<S sid="158" ssid="3">Intersection Levin sets partition these classes according to more co&#194;&#173; coherent subsets of features ( force , forestations separation , in effect highlighting a lattice of semantic features that determine the sense of a verb . </S>
			<S sid="159" ssid="4">Given the incompleteness of the list of members of Levin classes , each verb must be examined to see whether it exhibits all the al&#194;&#173; alternation of a class . </S>
			<S sid="160" ssid="5">This might be approxi&#194;&#173; mated by automatically extracting the syntac&#194;&#173; tic frames in which the verb occurs in corpus data , rather than manual analysis of each verb , as was done in this study . </S>
			<S sid="161" ssid="6">We have also examined a mapping between the English verbs that we have discussed and their Portuguese translations , which have sev&#194;&#173; era of the same properties as the corresponding verbs in English . </S>
			<S sid="162" ssid="7">Most of these verbs take the same alternations as in English and , by virtue of these alternations , achieve the same regular sense extensions . </S>
			<S sid="163" ssid="8">There are still many questions that require further investigation . </S>
			<S sid="164" ssid="9">First , since our experi&#194;&#173; met was based on a translation from English to Portuguese , we can expect that other verbs in Portuguese would share the same alternations , so the classes in Portuguese should by no means be considered complete . </S>
			<S sid="165" ssid="10">We will be using re&#194;&#173; sources such as dictionaries and on line corpora to investigate potential additional members of our classes . </S>
			<S sid="166" ssid="11">Second , since the translation map&#194;&#173; pings may often be many-to-many , the alternation re bat er ( bo unc e ) flu ( flo at ) roll r ( rol l ) deal ( sli de ) dire var ( dr ift ) pla nar ( gli de ) native &#226;&#128;&#162; c o n a t i v e c a u s . / i n c h . m i d d l e acc ept . </S>

			<S sid="172" ssid="17">In this experiment , we have tried to choose the Portuguese verb that is most closely related to the description of the English verb in the Levin class . </S>
			<S sid="173" ssid="18">We expect these cross-linguistic features to be useful for capturing translation generalizations between languages as discussed in the litera&#194;&#173; pure Palmer and Rosenzweig , 1996 ) , ( Copes&#194;&#173; take and Sanfilippo , 1993 ) , ( Dorr , 1997 ) . </S>
			<S sid="174" ssid="19">In pursuing this goal , we are currently implement&#194;&#173; ing features for motion verbs in the English Tree-Adjoining Grammar , TAG ( Bleam et al. , 1998 ) . </S>
			<S sid="175" ssid="20">TAGs have also been applied to Por&#194;&#173; Portuguese in previous work , resulting in a small Portuguese grammar ( Kipper , 1994 ) . </S>
			<S sid="176" ssid="21">We in&#194;&#173; tend to extend this grammar , building a more robust TAG grammar for Portuguese , that will allow us to build an English/Portuguese trans&#194;&#173; fer lexicon using these features . </S>
