Abstract
We  present  a  class-based   approach   to  building  a 
verb  lexicon   that  makes  explicit   the  close  asso­ 
ciation   between   syntax   and  semantics   for  Levin 
classes.    We  have  used  Lexicalized   Tree  Adjoin­ 
ing Grammars to capture the syntax associated  with 
each  verb class and have augmented the trees to in­ 
clude  sclcctional  restrictions.   In addition,  semantic 
predicates  arc associated  with each  tree,  which  al­ 
low for a compositional interpretation.

1   Introduction
The difficulty of achieving adequate hand-crafted 
semantic   representations  has  limited  the  field  of 
natural   language   processing   to  applications   that 
can be contained  within  well-clefinccl sub-domains. 
Despite many different lexicon clcvclopmcnt ap­ 
proaches   (Mel'cuk,  1988;  Copestakc   and  Sanfil­ 
ippo,  1993;   Lowe  et  al.,  1997),  the  field  has  yet 
to develop a clear consensus  on guidelines  for a 
computational lexicon.  One of the most controver­ 
sial  areas  in  building  such  a lexicon  is polysemy: 
how  senses  can  be computationally distinguished 
and characterized. We address  this problem  by em­ 
ploying compositional semantics  and the adjunction 
of syntactic  phrases to support regular verb sense 
extensions.  This  differs  from  the Lexical  Concep­ 
tual Structure (LCS)  approach  exemplified  by Voss 
(1996),  which  requires  a separate  LCS  representa­ 
tion for each  possible  sense  extension.    In this  pa­ 
per we describe  the construction of VcrbNet, a verb 
lexicon  with explicitly  stated  syntactic  and seman­ 
tic  information   for  individual  lexical  items,  using 
Levin verb classes (Levin, 1993) to systematically 
construct  lexical entries.  We use Lexicalizecl Tree 
Adjoining  Grammar (LTAG) (Joshi, 1987; Schabes,
1990) to capture  the syntax for each verb class,  and
associate  semantic  predicates  with each tree.
  Although   similar  ideas  have  been  explored   for 
verb sense extension  (Pustejovsky,  1995; Goldberg,


1995), our approach  of applying  LTAG to the prob­ 
lem  of  composing  and  extending  verb  senses   is 
novel.   LTAGs have an extended  domain  of local­ 
ity that captures  the arguments  of a verb in a local 
manner. The association  of semantic  predicates  to a 
tree yields a complete  semantics for the verb. More­ 
over, the operation  of adjunction  in LTAGs provides 
a mechanism  for extending  verb senses.

2   Levin classes

Levin verb classes arc based on the ability of a verb 
to occur  in diathesis  alternations,  which  arc  pairs 
of syntactic  frames  that arc in some sense  meaning 
preserving.  The fundamental assumption  is that the 
syntactic  frames  arc a direct reflection  of the under­ 
lying semantics.  However, Levin classes exhibit in­ 
consistencies that have hampered  researchers' abil­ 
ity to reference  them directly  in applications. Many 
verbs are listed  in multiple  classes,  some of which 
have conflicting  sets of syntactic  frames.  Dang ct al. 
(1998)  showed  that multiple  listings  could  in some 
cases be interpreted  as regular sense extensions,  and 
defined intcrsectivc  Levin classes,  which are a more 
fine-grained,   syntactically and semantically coher­ 
ent refinement  of basic Levin classes.  We represent 
these verb classes and their regular sense extensions 
in the LTAG formalism.

3   Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars

3.1    Overview of formalism

Lcxicalizcd  Tree Adjoining  Grammars  consist  of a 
finite  set  of  initial  and  auxiliary  elementary   trees, 
and  two  operations   to  combine them.    The  min­ 
imal,  non-recursive  linguistic   structures   of  a  lan­ 
guage, such as a verb and its complements, arc cap­ 
tured by initial trees. Recursive structures of a lan­ 
guage, such as prepositional modifiers  which result 
in syntactically embedded  VPs, arc represented  by 
auxiliary  trees.





  Elementary trees are combined by the operations 
of substitution and adjunction. Substitution is a sim­ 
ple operation that replaces a leaf of a tree with a new 
tree. Adjunction is a splicing operation that replaces 
an internal node of an elementary tree with an aux­ 
iliary tree.  Every tree is associated with a lexical 
item of the language, called the anchor of the tree. 
The tree represents the domain over which the lex­ 
ical item can directly specify syntactic constraints, 
such as subject-verb number agreement, or seman­ 
tic constraints, such as selectional restrictions, all of 
which are implemented as features.
LTAGs are more powerful than context free gram­
mars (CFG), allowing localization of so-called un­ 
bounded dependencies that cannot be handled by 
CFGs.  There are critical benefits to lexical seman­ 
tics that are provided by the extended domain of 
locality of the lexicalized  trees.   Each lexical en­ 
try corresponds to a tree.   If the lexical item is a 
verb, the corresponding tree is a skeleton for an en­ 
tire sentence with the verb already present, anchor­ 
ing the tree as a terminal symbol.  The other parts 
of the sentence will be substituted or adjoined in at 
appropriate places in the skeleton tree in the cou.rse 
of the derivation.  The composition of trees dunng 
parsing is recorded in a derivation tree. The deriva­ 
tion tree nodes correspond to lexically anchored el­ 
ementary trees, and the arcs are labeled with infor­ 
mation about how these trees were combined to pro­ 
duce the parse. Since each lexically anchored initial 
tree corresponds  to a semantic unit, the derivation 
tree closely resembles a semantic-dependency  rep­ 
resentation.

3.2   Semantics for TAGs
There is a range of previous work in incorporating 
semantics into TAG trees. Stone and Doran (1997) 
describe a system used for generation that simul­ 
taneously  constructs  the semantics  and  syntax  of 
a sentence using LTAGs. Joshi and Vijay-Shanker 
(1999),  and Kallmeyer and Joshi (1999), describe 
the semantics of a derivation tree as a set of attach­ 
ments of trees. The semantics of these attachments 
is given as a conjunction of formulae in a flat seman­ 
tic representation. They provide a specific method­ 
ology for composing semantic representations n.mch 
like Candito and Kahane (1998),  where the direc­ 
tionality of dominance in the derivation tree should 
be interpreted according to the operations used to 
build it. Kallmeyer and Joshi also use a flat semantic 
representation  to handle scope phenomena involv­ 
ing quantifiers.


4    Description of the verb lexicon

VerbNet can be viewed in both a static and a dy­ 
namic way. The static aspect refers to the verb and 
class entries and how they are organized, providing 
the characteristic descriptions of a verb sense or a 
verb class (Kipper et a!., 2000).  The dynamic as­ 
pect of the lexicon constrains the entries to allow 
a compositional  interpretation in LTAG derivation 
trees, representing extended verb meanings by in­ 
corporating adjuncts.
  Verb classes allow us to capture generalizations 
about verb behavim: Each verb class lists the the­ 
matic roles that the predicate-argument stmcture of 
its members  allows,  and provides descriptions  of 
the syntactic frames conesponding  to licensed con­ 
stmctions,  with selectional restrictions defined for
each  argument  in each frame. 1       Each  frame  also
includes semantic predicates describing  the partic­ 
ipants at various stages of the event described  by 
the frame.
  Verb classes are hierarchically organized, ensur­ 
ing that each class is coherent -that is, all its mem­ 
bers have common semantic elements and share a 
common set of thematic roles and basic syntactic 
frames. This requires some manual restmcturing of 
the original Levin classes, which is facilitated by us­ 
ing intersective Levin classes.

5    Compositional Semantics

We use TAG elementary  trees for the description 
of allowable frames and associate semantic predi­ 
cates with each tree, as was done by Stone and Do­ 
ran.  The semantic predicates are primitive enough 
so that many may be reused in different trees.  By 
using TAGs we get the additional benefit of an ex­ 
isting parser that yields derivations and derived trees 
from which we can construct the compositional se­ 
mantics of a given sentence.
  We  decompose   each   event   E   into  a  tripar­ 
tite structure in a manner similar to Moens and 
Steedman  (1988),  introducing  a time function  for 
each predicate  to specify whether the predicate is 
true in the preparatory (during(E)), culmination 
(end(E)), or consequent  (result(E)) stage of an 
event.
  Initial trees capture the semantics of the basic 
senses of verbs in each class.  For example,  many

  'These  restrictions arc more like preferences that generate a 
preferred reading of a sentence. They may be relaxed depend­ 
ing on the domain of a particular application.

Figure 1: Induced action alternation for the Run verbs




verbs in the Run class can occur  in the induced  ac­ 
tion alternation,  in which the subject of the intransi­ 
tive sentence  has the same thematic role as the direct 
object in the transitive sentence.  Figure 1 shows the 
initial  trees  for  the transitive  and  intransitive  vari­ 
ants for the Run class, along with their semantic 
predicates.   The entity  in motion  is given  by ar-gl, 
associated  with the syntactic  subject of the intransi­ 
tive tree and the direct  object  of the transitive  tree. 
The event denoted  by the transitive  variant is a com­ 
position  of two subevents:  Hl  refers to the event of 
ar·gl  running, and E2 refers to the event of an entity 
(ar·gO) causing  event El.
  Predicates  are associated  with  not only  the verb 
trees,  but  also  the  auxiliary   trees.    We use  a  flat 
semantic  representation   like that of Kallmeyer  and 
Joshi, and the semantics of a sentence is the con­ 
junction  of the semantic  predicates  of the trees used 
to derive  the sentence.  Figure 2 shows an auxiliary 
tree for a path prepositional  phrase headed  by "to", 
along with its associated  semantic  predicate.
  When the PP tree for "to the park" is adjoined into 
the intransitive  tree for "John  ran", the semantic  in­ 
terpretation  is the conjunction  of the two predicates 
motion( during( E ),john)  1\  goal( end( E ),john, park); 
adjunction    into  the  transitive   tree  for  "Bill   ran 
the horse" yields cause(durin[i(E2),bill,EI)  1\ nw­ 
tion( during( El ),horse) 1\ goal( end( E1 ),horse, park). 
In  both  cases,   the  argument   Xm·.qO.argl    (john  or 
horse)  for the auxiliary  tree is nonlocal  and comes
from  the  adjunction  site.2    The  arguments  are  re­
covered from the derivation  tree, following  Candito 
and Kahane.  When an initial tree is substituted  into 
another  tree, the dependency   mirrors the derivation 
structure,  so the variables  associated  with the sub-

2 X,,.  o.a,.  I  is the variable associated with the entity in mo­


stituting  tree can be referenced  as arguments  in the 
host tree's predicates.   When an auxiliary tree is 
adjoined,  the dependency  for the adjunction  is re­ 
versed,  so  that  variables  associated   with  the  host 
tree can  be referenced  as arguments  in the adjoin­ 
ing tree's  predicates.

  The tripartite  event structure  allows us to express 
the  semantics   of  classes  of  verbs  like  change  of 
state  verbs whose description  requires  reference  to 
a complex   event  structure.    In  the  case  of  a  verb 
such  as "break",   it is important  to make a distinc­ 
tion  between  the state of the object  before  the end 
of  the  action  and  the  new  state  that  results  after­ 
wards.  This event  structure  also handles  the cona­ 
tive construction, in which  there  is an intention  of 
a  goal  during   the  event,   that  is  not  achieved   at 
the  end  of  the  event.    The  example  of  the  cona­ 
tive construction shown in Figure 3 expresses  the 
intention   of  hitting  something.    Because   the  in­ 
tention   is  not  satisfied  the  semantics   do  not  in­ 
clude  the predicates  manner( end( E),force.fitl,Xm·go)
1\  contact( end( E),Xargo.Xm·gl),  that   express   the
completion  of the contact  with impact event.

our conjunction   of semantic  predicates.  The  orig­ 
inal  Hit verb class  does  not  include  movement  of 
the direct object as part of the meaning  of hit; only 
sudden contact  has to be established. By adjoining 
a path PP such as "across  NP",  we get an extended 
meaning,  and a change  in Levin class  membership 
to the Throw class. Figure 4 shows the class-specific

on the LTAG formalism,  for which we already  have 
a large English  grammar.  Palmer  et a!.  (1998)  de­ 
fined compositional semantics for classes of verbs 
implemented in LTAG, representing general seman­ 
tic components (e.g.,  motion,  manner)  as features 
on the nodes of the trees.  Our  use of separate  log­ 
ical forms gives a more detailed semantics for the 
sentence,  so that for an event involving  motion, it is 
possible to know not only that the event has a motion 
semantic  component, but also  which entity  is actu­ 
ally in motion.  This level of detail  is necessary  for 
applications such  as animation  of natural  language 
instructions (Bindiganavale et a!., 2000).   Another 
important contribution  of this work is that by divid­ 
ing each event into a tripartite  structure,  we permit a 
more precise definition  of the associated  semantics.

We have presented  a class-based  approach  to build­ 
ing a verb lexicon  that  makes  explicit  and  imple­ 
ments the close association  between  syntax  and se­ 
mantics, as postulated  by Levin. The power of the 
lexicon comes from its dynamic  aspect that is based

able to factor out some class-specific auxiliary  trees 
to be used across several verb classes.
