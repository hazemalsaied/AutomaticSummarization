Abstract

This paper presents a methodology for us- 
ing the argument structure of sentences as 
encoded by the PropBank  project  to de- 
velop clusters of verbs with similar mean- 
ing and usage   These clusters can be fa- 
vorably compared to the classes developed 
by the VerbNet project   The  most inter- 
esting cases are those where the cluster- 
ing methodology suggests new members for 
VerbNet classes which will then be associ- 
ated with the semantic predicates for that 
class 


1     Introduction

There can be no doubt that meaning is dependent 
upon a  great number of factors     The  diÆculty 
in higher-level comprehension in Natural Language 
Processing is due to the identification  of these factors 
as well as the successful implementation of methods 
for handling them  Early  generative models of syn- 
tax failed to answer the meaning question because of 
their assumption that semantics was a natural out- 
come of structure  thus neglecting the other factors 
involved   More recent works  such as those found 
in WordNet (Miller   1985  Fellbaum   1998) and its 
descendents fall short for the inverse reason  they 
focus solely on lexical meaning while ignoring struc- 
ture altogether 
  Another factor in the meaning game is the rela- 
tionship between individual lexical items of the same 
function   How are all determiners alike  for exam- 
ple  and how are they individually  different?  Are 
there subclasses within the class of determiners and 
how do these subclasses differ from each other? Hu- 
man beings are supreme pattern-matchers and assign 
things to categories almost to a fault  The categories


into which semantically loaded items are grouped
must therefore be one of the factors leading to higher-
level comprehension and knowledge of what these
categories are and how they are built can help solve
the greater meaning question 

2     Issue and Previous Work

Much previous work in the domain of classification 
of lexical items has focused on verbs  This is a nat- 
ural starting place  since the verb is the hook upon 
which the rest of a sentence hangs  Verbs also dis- 
play a higher degree of variation in their semantics 
than other lexical types  Whereas nouns for exam- 
ple  all  name some kind of  thing   verbs can de- 
scribe an action or a state and involve some num- 
ber of non-verbal actors in the description    It  is 
this latter quality of verbs which most interests us 
here  and indeed which has been the focus of most 
previous work in verb classification  Even the most 
elementary grammars of English draw a distinction 
between transitive and intransitive verbs  More ad- 
vanced work has refined this distinction into ever- 
larger numbers of classes   For example  the land- 
mark work of Levin (1993) divided over three thou- 
sand verbs into 191 classes based partly on shared se- 
mantics and partly on shared syntactic alternations 
More recently  the VerbNet project at Penn (Kip- 
per et al   2000) incorporated Levin s verb classifica- 
tion to systematically create verb entries in a lexi- 
con   On a purely semantic note   WordNet (Miller 
1985 Fellbaum  1998) has classified much of the vo- 
cabulary of English  not just verbs in terms of rela- 
tionships such as synonymy  hyponymy  and others 
Various attempts worldwide have begun focussing on 
the argument structure of verbs as part of develop- 
ing dependency grammars   The PropBank  project 
at Penn (Kingsbury and Palmer  2002) is an exam- 
ple of this process for English   similar projects are


underway for Czech (Hajicova etc)  German (Broker
1998)  and others  The FrameNet project at Berke-
ley (Baker et al   1998) has classified many words in
terms of their relation to a relatively small number
of core semantic concepts such as  commerce and
judgment    Various attempts have been made to
automatically cluster verbs into semantically mean-
ingful classes using the Levin class as a gold stan-
dard for evaluation (Gildea  2002 McCarthy  2000
Merlo and Stevenson 2001 Schulte im Walde 2000)
In the next two sections we provide background on
VerbNet and PropBank  which play central roles in
the cluster methodology presented here

2.1   VerbNet

VerbNet is a verb lexicon with syntactic and seman- 
tic information for English verbs  referring to Levin 
verb classes (Levin   1993) for systematic construc- 
tion of lexical entries  This lexicon exploits the sys- 
tematic link between syntax and semantics that mo- 
tivates these classes and thus provides a clear and 
regular association between syntactic and semantic 
properties of verbs and verb classes (Kipper  et al
2000  Dang et al    2000)   Each  class in the hier- 
archy is composed of a set of members (linked to 
their WordNet synsets) and a set of syntactic frames 
and semantic information for each frame  Currently 
VerbNet has over 4 000 verb senses described (3 004 
lemmas) within 191 first level classes
  VerbNet has a hierarchical structure with the first 
level classes constituted by the original Levin classes 
In order to ensure that each class is coherent so that 
all its members share a common set of thematic roles 
syntactic frames and semantic predicates some re- 
structuring of the classes was required  This reorga- 
nization  which was facilitated by the use of inter- 
sective Levin classes (Dang et al   1998) refined the 
classes to account for semantic and syntactic differ- 
ences within a class  A child subclass inherits all the 
information from its parent class and adds informa- 
tion to it  which can be in terms of imposing further 
restrictions on the roles or adding syntactic frames 
or semantic predicates to the subclass
  The hierarchical organization of VerbNet is illus- 
trated in Figure 1  The Transfer of a Message verb 
class is subdivided into three levels  At the top level 
are thematic roles  syntactic  frames and semantic 
predicates shared by all members of the class   In 
this particular case there is a transitive frame with 
the Topic (message) as the direct object (Agent Verb 
Topic)  as in "John explained trigonometry"  and a 
frame for Topic and Recipient (Agent Verb Topic to


the transfer of information event but in the first case
the Recipient is underspecified Some of the verbs in
this class are able to participate in other syntactic
frames as well   Verbs at the second level can take
the ditransitive frame (Agent Verb Recipient Topic)
in addition to the frames and predicates inherited
from the parent class
  VerbNet  uses a  fiat  semantic representation in 
which the semantics of each syntactic frame is cap- 
tured by a conjunction of predicates 1   such as mo- 
tion,  contact, transfer info  which can be negated or 
not   These predicates can take arguments over the 
verb complements as well as over implicit existen- 
tially quantified event variables
  Each semantic predicate in VerbNet also include 
a  time  function specifying whether the predicate 
is  true  in  the preparatory (during(E ))  culmina- 
tion (end(E )) or consequent (result(E )) stage of an 
event in a tripartite event structure is similar to that 
of Moens and Steedman (1988)  which allows us to 
express the semantics of classes of verbs like change 
of state verbs whose description requires reference to 
a complex event structure

2.2   PropBank

In a different vein the PropBank project (Kingsbury 
and Palmer  2002) has endeavoured to describe all 
the most frequent verbs of English in terms of their 
argument structure   This  project has three major 
differences from previous works  First   the descrip- 
tion of each verb is accompanied by a rich set of 
examples drawn from real language in this case the 
Wall  Street Journal sections of the Penn Treebank 
(Marcus  1994)   Furthermore   the descriptions are 
based on the usages in the corpus rather than a pos- 
sible situation where the corpus was mined for sen- 
tences fitting preconceived patterns  This results in 
many instances which are perfectly well-formed but 
unexpected The best example of this is an odd usage 
of the verb add   The  Nasdaq  composite  index added
1 01 to 456 6 on pa try  vo ume    where the context 
makes it clear that add is being used as a synonym for 
rise   Second argument structure allows for a richer 
set of descriptions than merely  transitive     unac- 
cusative   and so forth  since any individual verb is 
allowed to have anywhere between zero and six ar- 
guments  Third  and perhaps most importantly  the 
PropBank descriptions make explicit mention of the 
different senses of verbs  This is crucial because dif- 
ferent senses can have different argument structures 
or different syntactic alternations  a detail which is 
often glossed over in other resources Thus  while (1)

syntactic frames have semantic predicates expressing


Presently there  are 64 distinct predicates described.

((THE ATIC ROLES  )) 	Agent(A), Recipient(R), Topic(T)
((SELECT RESTRICTIONS )) 	Agent[+animate], 
Recipient[+animate],

((FRA ES and  PREDICATES ))

(4) do not  because of the ungrammaticality of (4)

1 Congress passed the bill

2 John passed the butter

3 The bill passed

4 *The butter passed

  Under the PropBank scheme the similarity be- 
tween pass  (make  bill  into  law)  and pass  (move 
from one place to another) is regarded an almost- 
accidental byproduct of centuries of semantic drift 
The  combination of accounting for all  the usages 
in  a  large corpus and separating verb senses re- 
sults in a very large database  4358 distinct senses 
spread across 3183 lexical items with a total of over
70 000 unique tokens   PropBank  annotations are 
recorded as theory-neutrally as possible  Crucially 
the nomenclature of traditional thematic roles is not 
used  instead  simple labels of Arg0  Arg1 and so 
forth are used  Each ArgX  is mapped to a specific 
role on a per-verb basis such as the roleset for give

Arg0  giver
Arg1  gift
Arg2  given-to
ex	 ArgO    The  executives] gave  Arg2     the
chefs] Arg1   a standing ovation]


  Such a schema has its advantages and its draw- 
backs  On the negative side it makes it diÆcult to 
draw comparisons between various arguments with 
the same number The meaning of Arg2 for one verb


might bear no relation to the meaning of Arg2 for
some other verb  for example  On the plus side not
using traditional thematic roles both frees the anno-
tators from the necessity of distinguishing between
Theme and Patient  for example while also allowing
for roles which do not have corresponding thematic
roles  For example PropBank has a host of verbs re-
lating to the judicial process such as jai    sentence
imprison   and so forth  All of these take four roles

Arg0  lawgiver
Arg1  guilty party
Arg2  term  length of jail time
Arg3  crime
ex	Dallas  District  Judge Jack  Hampton
had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with
his  remarks to the press last  December
two weeks after  ArgO    *trace�Hampton*]
sentencing Arg1    an 18-year-old defendant]
to  Arg2    30 years in state prison] for  Arg3
killing two homosexual men in a city park ]


  While Args 0 and 1 can be thought of as Agent 
and Patient   traditional  thematic role terminology 
fails to accommodate Args 2 and 3  for all that they 
are central to the meaning of the verbs

3     Methodology

The PropBank  annotations thus provide a rich set 
of actual usages which are easily divided into senses 
and quantified   That  is  for any verb (sense) it is 
possible to collect all the usages divide them into 
their various syntactic realizations  and enumerate 
these realizations   The realizations themselves are


rendered at a very basic level encoding only the lin-
ear order of arguments  The verb itself is rendered
as re  for  relation	Thus a verb such as repea  can
appear in either a simple transitive or passive

 ArgO     West  Germany]  will   repeal   Arg1 
the unpopular turnover tax on security 
transactions]  (wsj 0302)
--- Arg0 rel Arg1

the tax  will  be oÆcially repealed  Arg1


but with different Arg0 s  The annotator of this sen-
tence clearly forgot this specification	Fortunately
PropBank is proceeding through a double blind an-
notation followed by an adjudication phase The ad-
judication will catch and correct structures such as
the above  For the time being however such errors
are retained largely for want of an eÆcient and ac-
curate filtering mechanism

Other filtering on the data is performed however
Since the TreeBank  corpus is subject to the same
2


*trace�the tax*]  before the  end of  the


Zipfian distribution


of lexical items as any natural-


current parliamentary term    (wsj 0302)
--- rel Arg1


  As seen in the second example  adjuncts such as 
the temporal before the end of the current par iamen- 
tary term are omitted  While the bulk of annotations 
fall into basic categories such as Arg0 rel Arg1 (ba- 
sic transitive)  Arg0 rel Arg1 Arg2 (ditransitive)  and 
so forth  the nature of the data and the annotation 
process itself means that there is a large residue of ir- 
regular syntactic realizations  As an example of the 
former  consider the following sentence where the 
benefactive argument has been topicalized to the be- 
ginning

For  Arg4   Mr  Sherwin]   ArgO  a conviction] 
could carry  Arg1    penalties of five years in 
prison and a $250 000 fine on each count] 
(wsj 1331) --- Arg4 Arg0 rel Arg1

  Such a construction is certainly a natural part of 
English   yet it occurs very rarely-only  twice in all 
of Propbank (so far)   The annotation process itself 
also introduces many odd  low-frequency syntactic 
realizations which should be regarded as errors  For 
example  occasionally annotators include one argu- 
ment label twice

  the board also was informed  of Arg1   in- 
terest] expressed by   ArgO    buy-out funds

and Forstmann Little  & Co ]  as well as by 
ArgO   Robert Bass  Morgan Stanley s buy- 
out fund  and Pan Am Corp]   (wsj 2104)
--- Arg1 rel Arg0 Arg0

  In cases of such conjoined constructions the an- 
notation guidelines specify that the sentence should 
be regarded as two overlapping sentences with two 
overlapping argument structures  Thus  for the sen- 
tence above there should properly be two instances 
of Arg1 rel Arg0   each with the same Arg1 and rel


language database many verbs are only poorly at-
tested	A  largely arbitrary  decision was made to
eliminate all verbs which had fewer than 10 attesta-
tions  Finally  again due to the ongoing nature of the
PropBank work  not all polysemous verbs have been
disambiguated  These verbs were also deleted from
the subsequent analysis  All the same the resulting
dataset provides 921 verbs with 200 distinct syntactic
realizations of varying frequencies Each realization
was recorded as a proportion of the number of attes-
tations of that syntactic pattern to the total num-
ber of attestations of that verb  Expressing these as
proportions rather than as raw counts allows for bet-
ter comparisons among verbs which themselves vary
widely in frequency The proportions themselves are
then run through a standard clustering algorithm im-
plemented in R  (http jjwww R-project org) which
classifies each verb by the difference between its at-
tested proportions and the proportions attested by
every other verb  Verbs with little difference mean-
ing they attest nearly the same syntactic patterns in
nearly the same proportions are judged to be very
similar and are likely to be grouped into the same
class	A  varying number of "centroids"  or proto-
types for each class can be established  Each verb
is then classified by its similarity  to the centroids
resulting in a number of classes equal to the num-
ber of centroids  The resulting classes are compared
to the existing VerbNet classes	This  is at best a
noisy measure of accuracy  since many of the Prop-
Banked verbs (even fairly  richly-attested ones) are
not classified in VerbNet  and many verbs which are
classified in VerbNet are not present in PropBank in
suÆcient numbers to undergo the clustering analysis
These factors are constant across all possible number
of centroidsjclasses however so at least the amount
of noise in the assessment remains constant as well




   The probability of occurrence of words or other  items 
starts high  and  tapers off. Thus, a few occur  very  often 
while many  others  occur  rarely.


4     Results

As an initial assessment of the worth of the method- 
ology consider the case with only three clusters  The 
clusters can be viewed graphically in Figure 2
  The crosses are the centroids  Such a display as 
this is naturally a gross simplification of the actual
200-dimensional space the clusters are mapped in 
but it s the best that can be done on paper  If we look
at (a sample of ) the membership of each of the three 
clusters we see that the three groups clearly fall into
the sets of transitive  unaccusative and ditransitive
verbs 3








  For higher numbers of clusters a more formal 
method of measuring accuracy is required  Since we 
are comparing sets the similarity of two sets A and 
B can be computed with the following


IAnBI
similarity(A, B)� IAUBI
  In other words  the similarity  of two sets can be 
measured as the number of elements shared by the 
two sets divided by the total number of unique el- 
ements in the two sets    Thus   two identical sets


etc)   This  demonstrates how a three-cluster analy-
sis  while interesting for describing a gross syntactic
grouping does not go very far in describing any finer-
grained meaning contrasts
 To get at the classification with real implications 
for meaning we clearly need to use more smaller clus- 
ters   How many more  and how small?  Since the 
original set of verbs under analysis comes from 150
VerbNet classes we can set an upper bound on the 
number of clusters at 150  Then we iteratively derive 
clusters for each number between 3 and 150 and find 
the similarity scores for each cluster in each of those 
sets   To  facilitate comparison between the various 
sets of clusters  we calculate the average similarity 
across all the classes  This  is necessary because as 
the number of clusters rises the size of any individual 
cluster is likely to fall  thus bringing the denominator 
of the similarity equation down Taken across all the 
clusters then the similarity scores are bound to rise 
regardless of improvements in the matching between 
the VerbNet clusters and the automatically-derived 
ones The outcome of this procedure can be seen in 
Figure 3
  Interesting peaks appear for analyses with 14 clus- 
ters and around 89 clusters before the long tailing 
off with more than 90 clusters  In addition  there is 
a local maximum around 32 clusters  The analyses 
with 14 clusters still uses very large clusters (aver- 
age of 65 verbsjcluster)  so that number is less useful 
The smallest cluster developed therein however con-
4


({a  b} {b  a}) would have a similarity  score of 1


sists only of remain and stay 01


and that cluster


because the intersection contains two elements  as
does the union  Two sets a  b and a  b	z would
have a very low similarity  score since the intersec-
tion contains two elements but that is divided by the
union with 26 elements	Thus  the similarity  score
is dependent  both on the number of matches and
the number of spurious elements present For exam-
ple  the three clusters described above most closely
align to the VerbNet classes 13 5 1 (Get class)  45 6
( a ibratab e change state class)  and 48 1 1 ((ppear
c ass)  respectively with 4  4  and 7 matching ele-
ments  Each of these clusters is huge however (521
335 and 65 verbs respectively)  and the target sets
are also large as VerbNet clusters go (31  23 and 27
verbs respectively)  These factors conspire to make
the overall similarity  scores quite low (4j(521+31)

correctly maps to VerbNet class 47 1-1 (Exist class)
which contains verbs of staying in place
  By the time around 90 clusters are used the derived 
classes themselves tend to be very small  with  34 
clusters containing two or fewer verbs  In contrast 
a few clusters continue to have very large member- 
ship  such as two groups (arbitrarily labeled 3  and
 38 ) which contain 145 and 146 verbs  respectively 
and which correspond roughly to VerbNet classes
29 5 ( onjecture class) and 29 2 ( haracteri e class) 
While 29 2 is one of the largest classes in VerbNet
precisely why this class should seem to attract  va- 
grant verbs remains to be seen	More interesting
however are the times when the clustering process
establishes multiple clusters which are all identified
with the same VerbNet class - in effect suggesting
subclasses where they have not previously appeared


ask.On:  ask  a  question, as  opposed  to  ask  a  favor;
feel.On: feel emotion;  make.O5: make  money,  as in "Paul 
doesn't make nearly  enough  money;  triple:  while in most 
English  this would be considered a transitive verb, the 
common  usage in the  Wall Street Journal is actually un-


This  trend appears even with fairly low numbers of
clusters and it tends to be extremely consistent as to
which VerbNet clusters are split  For example class
45 4 (Other change state)  containing the  miscella-


acusative, as in "Paul's net worth tripled when he found

neous causatives   is first split into two subclasses
even when only 9 clusters are in  play  indicating
that there is more variation in the syntactic patterns
within this single class than there is between almost
any other arbitrarily-selected pair of classes   It  is
hardly surprising that a collection labeled miscella-
neous should contain such a wide variety of syntac-
tic patterns  What is surprising and encouraging is
the speed at which this methodology identifies this
miscellany and moves to correct it
  In one example of how previously-unclassified

ter 20 within the 90-cluster analysis  This grouping 
is optimally identified with VerbNet class 36 3 (Meet 
class)  verbs of combative meetings It contains un- 
surprisingly  verbs such as fght  and consu t    The 
clustering analysis adds  in addition  verbs such as 
pu   0   (phrasal   pu    out) and withdraw    The for- 
mer  like all phrasal verbs is neglected by VerbNet 
while the latter is considered to be part of the  re- 
move classes (10 1 and 10 5)  Yet it might be just as 
natural to think of withdraw  in the sense of exiting 
a meeting or an engagement rather than removing 
something from somewhere  For example   It was
just another  one of the risk factorsr that  ed to the 
company s decision to withdraw from the bidding, he 
added (wsj 0013)  Another verb placed into this clus- 
ter is hedge  Impressionistically this might appear to 
be restricted to "hedge one s bets" and thus a poor
match for this fairly combative class  Upon examina- 
tion of the actual usages however it becomes clear
that most of the time hedge is being used to mean


protect   from)   as in But  some investors  might pre-
fer  a  simp er  strategy  than  hedging their  individua 
ho dings (wsj 1962) or Thus,  buying puts after  a big 
market s ide can be an expensive way to hedge against 
risk (wsj 2415)   Seen this way  hedge is a plausible 
member of this class  and since it  is hitherto un- 
treated by VerbNet  the clustering analysis provides 
a valuable suggestion for an unexpected meaning It 
also avoids erroneously attributing a change of loca- 
tion predicate to the sentence


  For another example  consider cluster 25 of the 
same 90-cluster analysis    The  verbs in this group 
contain verbs of directed motion such as put 01 and 
funne   and is identified with VerbNet class 9 3 (Fun- 
ne   class)    The  VerbNet description for this class 
specifies three arguments  Agent  Theme  and Des- 
tination    The  Destination role is further specified 
as being restricted to those cases where the Theme 
and Destination end up in close contact  Thus  this 
class includes usages such as put the toy in the box 
but not put the money towards  a new car   Another 
verb which is placed into this class is cast 01  which 
is restricted to a small number of near-idioms such 
as cast a pa    over)  and cast doubt  on)   Because of 
this restriction  it has not previously been handled 
by VerbNet  The clustering successfully includes this 
in the same class as put and funne    even including 
the selectional restriction on the types of Destina- 
tion allowed for only over and on will be found with 
this sense of cast   This would also assign the correct 
semantic predicates to cast

5     Conclusion and Future Directions

Clustering of syntactic patterns can quickly and 
automatically provide a first approximation of the 
groupings into  which  meaning-bearing  items fall 
The   methodology easily  captures  low-level  gen- 
eralizations  and  points  out  shortcomings in  the 
gold standard  verb classification against which it 
was judged    Nevertheless  it  is only a first  pass 
at transforming syntactic structure into semantics 
Additional information is available to extend the 
paradigm For example the syntactic patterns which 
were the subject of the clustering algorithm were 
nothing more than the linear order of the argu- 
ments of the verb   Further  refinement on the syn- 
tactic structure would be possible at the expense of 
multiplying the patterns   For instance  in the pre- 
ceding all prepositions were stripped from the ar- 
gument structure  even though PropBank  includes 
the preposition as part of the argument label rather 
than as part of the argument itself   Also  it would 
be possible to label the arguments with  thematic 
roles instead of the generic labels used by PropBank 
when possible thus providing a measure of semantics 
mixed in with the syntax  Kipper et al  (submitted
2003) describes the process of mapping PropBank 
argument labels onto VerbNet thematic roles  Cur-


rently  over 64% of the PropBank  argument labels
have been mapped automatically  and that is with-
out recourse to the sense-disambiguated data  This
suggests that the two resources are highly compati-
ble and that the combined data could easily be used
in the clustering methodology A larger measure of
meaning could be added if some notion of the mean-
ing of the verbs could be included in the clustering
as well  For example WordNet synonym sets espe-
cially as encoded in VerbNet  could be used as the
initial state of the clusters which then could be mod-
ified by the disjsimilarity of the syntactic patterns
attested by those verbs  Such refinements to the pro-
cess would in themselves be steps towards integrating
the many factors that contribute to the understand-
ing of meaning
