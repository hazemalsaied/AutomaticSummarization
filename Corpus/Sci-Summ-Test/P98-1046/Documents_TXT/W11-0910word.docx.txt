Abstract

We take the first steps towards augmenting a lexical 
resource, VerbNet, with probabilistic information 
about coercive constructions. We focus on CAUSED- 
MOTION as an example construction occurring with 
verbs for which it is a typical usage or for which it 
must be interpreted as extending the event semantics 
through coercion, which occurs productively and adds 
substantially to the relational semantics of a verb. 
However, through annotation we find that VerbNet 
fails to accurately capture all usages of the 
construction. We use unsupervised methods to 
estimate  probabilistic measures from corpus data for 
predicting usage of the construction across verb 
classes in the lexicon and evaluate against VerbNet. 
We discuss how these methods will form the basis for 
enhancements for VerbNet supporting more accurate 
analysis of the relational semantics of a verb across 
productive usages.

1     Introduction

Automatic semantic analysis has been very successful 
when taking a supervised learning approach on data 
labeled with sense tags and semantic roles (e.g., see 
Màrquez et al., 2008). Underlying these recent successes 
are lexical resources, such as PropBank (Palmer et al.,
2005), VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2008), and FrameNet 
(Baker et al., 1998; Fillmore et al., 2002), which encode 
the relational semantics of numerous lexical items, 
especially verbs. However, because authors and speakers 
use verbs productively in previously unseen ways, 
semantic analysis systems must not be limited to direct 
extrapolation from previously seen usages licensed by 
static lexical resources (cf. Pustejovsky & Jezek, 2008). 
To achieve more accurate semantic analyses, we must 
augment such resources with knowledge of the 
extensibility of verbs.
Central to verb extensibility is the process of semantic


and syntactic coercion. Coercion allows a verb to be used 
in “atypical” contexts that extend its relational semantics, 
thereby enabling expression of a novel concept, or simply 
more fluid expression of a complex concept. For 
example, consider a strictly intransitive action verb such 
as blink. This verb may instead be used in a construction 
with an object, as in She blinked the snow off her lashes, 
leading to an interpretation of the verb in which the object 
is causally affected and changes location (the CAUSED- 
MOTION construction; Goldberg, 1995). This type of 
constructional coercion is common in language and 
underlies much extensibility of verb usages. 
Understanding such coercive processes thus has 
significant impact on how we should represent 
knowledge about verbs in a lexical resource.
  Importantly, constructional coercion is not an all-or- 
nothing process – a word must be semantically and
syntactically compatible in some respects with a context
in order for its use to be extended to that context, but the 
restrictions on compatibility are not hard-and-fast rules
(Langacker, 1987; Kay & Fillmore, 1999; Goldberg,
2006; Goldberg, to appear). Gradience of compatibility 
plays an important role in coercion, suggesting that a 
probabilistic approach may be necessary for encoding 
knowledge of constructional coercion in a verb lexicon 
(cf. Lapata & Lascarides, 2003).
  Our hypothesis here is that, due to this gradient process 
of productivity, existing verb lexicons do not adequately 
capture the actual patterns of use of extensible 
constructions. In this paper, we focus on the CAUSED- 
MOTION (CM) construction as an initial test case. We first 
annotate the classes of an extensive verb lexicon, 
VerbNet, as to whether the CM construction is allowed 
for all, some, or none of the verbs in the class, noting 
additionally whether it is a typical or coerced usage. We 
find that many of the classes that allow the construction 
for at least some verbs do not include the CM frame in 
their definition, indicating a significant shortcoming in the 
relational knowledge encoded in the lexicon. Next, we


develop probabilistic measures for determining to what 
degree a class is likely to admit the CM construction. We 
then test our measures over corpus data, manually 
annotated for use of the CM construction. Finally, we 
present preliminary work on automatic techniques for 
calculating the proposed measures in an unsupervised 
way, to avoid the need for expensive manual annotation. 
This work forms the preliminary steps toward empirically 
augmenting VerbNet‟s predictive capabilities concerning 
the event semantics of verbs in coercible constructions.

2     Extensible Constructions and VerbNet

Construction grammar has much insight to offer on the 
topic of productivity and on the resulting statistical 
patterns and gradience of usages (e.g., Langacker, 1987; 
Kay & Fillmore, 1999; Goldberg, 2006). A construction 
is formally defined to be any pairing of linguistic form 
(e.g., a syntactic frame) and meaning. Words can be used 
in constructions to the extent that their lexical semantics is 
compatible with – or can be coerced to be compatible 
with – the semantic constraints on the construction.
  It is this notion of constructional coercion, and degree 
of coercibility, that accounts for the richness of usages 
that go beyond those thought of as typical or definitional 
for a verb: by coercing a verb not normally associated 
with a particular frame to occur in it, the meaning of the 
event can take on additional properties not considered a 
core part of the verb‟s semantics. For example, in the case 
of the sentence discussed above, She blinked the snow off 
her lashes, it is not the verb but rather the CM 
construction itself that licenses the direct object and adds 
the notion of “motion causally affecting the object” to the 
event semantics. Amongst other examples of well-known 
constructional coercions are: (1) The CAUSE-RECEIVE 
construction has the syntactic form of NP-V-NP-NP. For 
example, in Bob painted Sally a picture, the simple 
transitive verb paint gains the CAUSE TO RECEIVE sense, 
in which Sally is the recipient and the picture is the 
transferred item. (2) The WAY construction has the form 
of NP-V-[POSS way]-PP. For example, in Frank found 
his way to New York, the construction allows the verb 
find to gain a motion reading (i.e., “Frank traveled to New 
York”) that would not otherwise be allowed (e.g., *Frank 
found to New York).
  Recognizing such extensions to the relational 
semantics  of  verbs  is  very  important  for  accurate
semantic   interpretation  in  NLP.   However,  precise
specifications for capturing the notion of coercible 
constructions, such as are needed for a computational
resource, have heretofore been lacking.


2.1     VerbNet & Knowledge of Constructions

Computational verb lexicons are key to supporting NLP 
systems aimed at semantic interpretation. Verbs express 
the semantics of an event being described as well as the 
relational information among participants in that event, 
and project the syntactic structures that encode that 
information. Verbs are also highly variable, displaying a 
rich range of semantic and syntactic behavior.
  Verb classifications help NLP systems to deal with 
this complexity by organizing verbs into groups that
share  core  semantic  and  syntactic  properties.  For
example, VerbNet (derived from Levin‟s [1993] work, 
Kipper et al., 2008) is widely used for a number of
semantic  processing  tasks,  including  semantic  role
labeling (Swier and Stevenson, 2004), the creation of 
semantic parse trees (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005), and 
implicit argument resolution (Gerber and Chai, 2010). 
The detailed semantic predicates listed with each 
VerbNet class also have the potential to contribute to text- 
specific semantic representations and, thereby, to tasks 
requiring inferencing (Zaenen et al., 2008; Palmer et al.,
2009).
  VerbNet  identifies  semantic  roles  and  syntactic 
patterns characteristic of the verbs in each class makes
explicit the connections between the syntactic patterns 
and the underlying semantic relations that can be inferred
for all members of the class. Each syntactic frame in a 
class has a corresponding semantic representation that 
details the semantic relations between event participants
across the course of the event. For example, one of the 
characteristic  patterns  listed  for  the  Pour  class  is  a
CAUSED-MOTION pattern, which accounts for sentences 
like She poured water from the pitcher into the bowl. This 
is represented in VerbNet as follows:
Syntactic representation:
NP V NP PP PP
Agent V Theme Source Location
Semantic representation:
MOTION (DURING(E), THEME)
NOT (PREP (START(E), THEME, LOCATION)) 
PREP (START(E), THEME, SOURCE)
PREP (END(E), THEME, LOCATION)
CAUSE (AGENT, E)
This representation details connections between the 
syntax and semantics using the semantic roles as links, 
indicating that the Agent is the Subject NP and has 
CAUSED the Event, and that the Theme is the Object NP 
and has a new LOCATION at the end of the event. These 
types of inferences provide the foundation for deep 
semantic analysis of text.


  However, the specifications in VerbNet (as in other 
predicate lexicons, such as FrameNet, Baker et al., 1998; 
Fillmore et al., 2002) are seen as definitional – they are 
restricted to the core usages of the verbs that are valid for 
all verbs in the class. However, as noted above, people 
often use verbs productively, in ways that go beyond the 
boundaries of the verb class structure. It is important to 
correctly identify these productive usages when they 
occur, since they may be explicitly adding crucial 
inferences. If a construction is not recognized in the form 
of a syntactic frame in VerbNet, such inferences are not 
possible, greatly reducing VerbNet‟s utility and coverage. 
For example, creative uses of a verb, such as She blinked 
the snow off her lashes, would have no corresponding 
frame in blink‟s class, the Hiccup class.  It contains one 
intransitive frame:
NP V 
Agent V
BODY_PROCESS (E, AGENT)
INVOLUNTARY (E, AGENT)
Sentences that coerce the meaning of blink to fit with a 
CM event would currently be misanalysed. One option 
might be to augment the Hiccup class with the CM frame 
from the Pour class, which would ensure that such 
sentences would be analyzed more accurately. However, 
given the productive nature of constructional coercion 
and its widespread applicability, the approach of adding 
any possible pattern to each class is not appropriate: this 
would undermine the definitional distinctions between 
classes and greatly lessen their usefulness.
  Complicating the issue is the phenomenon of regular 
sense extensions (Dang et al., 1998), where what once 
may have been coercion has become entrenched and is 
now seen as a different sense of the verb. For example, 
the verbs in the Push class express the general meaning of 
exerting force on an object, such as She pushed on the 
wall. Often, the exertion of force moves the object, which 
can be expressed in a CM construction such as She 
pushed the box across the room. VerbNet accounts for 
this regular sense extension by including most of the Push 
verbs in the Carry class as well, which has the CM 
construction as one of its frames. Deciding when to 
include a verb in another class based on regular sense 
extensions, when to add a frame for a construction to a 
class, or when to reject the frame as a defining part of a 
class, is made difficult by the graded nature of matches 
between verbs and a construction. Our goal is to maintain 
the advantages of the class structure of VerbNet while 
enhancing it with a graded view of the applicability of a 
construction for each class. Noting the applicability of a


construction will enable the inclusion of its appropriate 
semantic predicates, and the inferencing over them, 
which are currently not supported.

3     Our Proposal: Constructional 
Profiles

We aim to augment VerbNet with knowledge of 
constructions that are likely to be used extensibly with 
a range of verbs. Such extensible constructions will be 
core usages for some classes (such as the CM for the 
Pour class, as noted above) but will be less characteristic 
of the fundamental semantics of other verb classes (such 
as CM for the Hiccup class). We propose to identify 
such a construction and its varying roles in the 
different classes by using relevant statistics over usages 
of verbs in a corpus – what we call a constructional 
profile.
  A constructional profile is a probabilistic assessment 
of the usage of a particular construction by the verbs in 
a
class. We developed the following three measures 
to
capture the relevant behavior, with the goal of 
providing both type- and token-based views of the 
behavior of a verb class with respect to a target 
construction:

  We hypothesize that these measures will have high 
values for those classes for which the construction 
should be definitional; very low values for those classes 
that are not compatible with the construction; and 
varying values for those classes that allow coerced 
usages to a greater or lesser extent.
  Although these probabilities are intuitively very 
simple, estimating them from corpus data poses a 
significant challenge. Since a construction is a pairing 
of form with meaning, recognizing the use of a 
particular


construction is not simply a matter of determining the 
syntactic pattern of the usage; rather, certain semantic 
properties and relations must co-occur with the syntactic 
pattern. Earlier work has shown that a supervised learning 
method was able to discriminate potential usages of the 
CM construction given training sentences manually 
labeled as either CM or not (Hwang et al., 2010). Here, 
we aim instead to identify usages of the CM construction, 
but without requiring an expensive manual annotation 
effort. That is, we seek an unsupervised method for 
estimating the probabilities in P1–P3 above.
  We approach this goal in steps as follows. First, we 
examine all the classes in VerbNet to see which allow the
CM construction (Section 4). This anno-tation reveals
shortcomings in VerbNet‟s representa-tion (classes that 
allow the CM construction but do not list it) and also 
provides a gold standard with which to evaluate our 
method of identifying an exten-sible construction using 
our constructional profiles. Second, we use the manually 
annotated CM construction data from Hwang et al. 
(2010) to estimate probabilities P1–P3 using maximum 
likelihood formulations (Section 5). An analysis of the 
predictive power of these constructional profile measures 
shows a good match with the distinctions made in the 
human annotation of the classes. Thus, our annotation 
based constructional profile measures show promise for 
identifying relevant behaviors of the construction across 
the classes. Third, we explore automatic methods for 
estimating the constructional profile measures without the 
need for manual annotations (Section 6). We use a 
hierarchical Bayesian model that learns verb classes from 
corpus data to provide unsupervised estimates of the 
constructional profiles, which also exhibit the relevant 
distinctions across the classes.

4     Annotating the VerbNet Resource

We begin with a manual examination of the resource and 
a thorough annotation of the status of each class with 
respect to the CM construction. This effort reveals a 
number of shortcomings in VerbNet, and the need for 
developing methods that can support the extension of 
VerbNet to better reflect the coercive uses of 
constructions across the classes. The annotation described 
here also forms the basis for the evaluation in the 
following sections of our new probabilistic measures, by 
motivating hypotheses about the expected patterns of use 
of the CM construction across the classes.

4.1     Annotation Guidelines and Results

The first goal of our manual annotation of VerbNet


classes was to determine which classes currently 
represent CM in one of their frames. To this end, we 
identified which classes contain the following frame:
NP [Agent/Cause]-V-NP [Patient/Theme]- 
PP [Source/Destination/Recipient/Location]
These frames correspond to classes such as Slide, with its
frame NP-V-NP-PP.Destination: Carla slid the books to 
the floor. We also examined classes with the patterns NP-
V-NP-PP.Oblique, NP-V-NP-PP. Theme2, and NP-V-
NP-PP.Patient2. In these classes, annotators had to judge 
whether the final PP was compatible with CM. For 
example, the Breathe class contains the frame NP-V- 
NP.Theme-PP.Oblique, The dragon breathed fire on 
Mary, which is compatible with CM; whereas the same 
basic frame in the Other_cos class is not: NP V NP 
PP.Oblique, The summer sun tanned her skin to a golden 
bronze.
  In   addition,   we  annotated  which  classes   were 
potentially compatible with CM for either all verbs in the
class or only some verbs. The "some" classification has 
the drawback that it may be applied to classes with very
different proportions of compatible verbs; while suitable 
for our exploratory work here, we plan to make finer 
distinctions in the future. A secondary determination was
whether or not the class was compatible with CM as part 
of its core semantics, or if it was compatible with CM
because it was coercible into the construction. A verb was 
considered “compatible with CM” and “not coerced” if 
the verb could be used in the CM construction and its
semantics, as reflected in VerbNet‟s semantic predicates,
involved a CAUSE predicate in combination with another 
predicate  such  as  CONTACT, TRANSFER, (EN)FORCE,
EMIT,   TAKE_IN    (predicates   potentially   involving
movement along some path). For example, although CM
is not already included as a frame for the Bend class 
containing the verb fold, the semantics of this class 
include CAUSE and CONTACT, and the verb can be used 
in a CM construction: She folded the note into her 
journal. Therefore, this class would have been considered 
“compatible with CM” but “not coerced”. Conversely, a 
verb was considered “compatible with CM” and 
“coerced” if the verb could be used in the CM 
construction, yet its semantics, again as reflected in 
VerbNet, did not involve CAUSE and MOVEMENT 
ALONG A PATH (e.g., the verb wiggle of the 
Body_internal_motion class: She wiggled her foot out of 
the boot).
  In summary, as presented in the table below, we 
annotated each class according to whether (1) the CM
construction was already represented in VerbNet for this
class, (2) the construction was possible for all, some, or


none of the verbs in that class, and (3) the verbs of any 
class compatible with CM were coerced into the 
construction or not. The classification for (3) was made 
regardless of whether “all” verbs or only “some” were 
compatible with CM. This determination was made 
uniformly for a class: there were no classes in which only 
certain CM-compatible verbs were considered “coerced”.

Notably, we identified 206 classes where at least some of 
the verbs in that class are compatible with the CM 
construction; however, VerbNet currently only 
recognizes the CM construction in 58 classes. There were 
several classes of interest: First, although it may seem 
unusual that CM is represented in 6 classes where we 
found that only “some” verbs were compatible with CM 
(e.g., Cheat class), these were cases where only more 
restricted subclasses are compatible with CM, and this 
syntactic frame is listed for that subclass. This suggests 
subclasses may provide a more precise characterization 
of which verbs are compatible with a construction.
  Secondly, we identified 18 classes in which all verbs 
were compatible with CM without coercion; thus, these 
classes could likely be improved by the addition of the 
CM syntactic frame. Additionally, we found 30 classes in 
which all verbs are coercible into the CM construction; 
however, the actual likelihood of a verb in those classes 
occurring in a CM construction remains to be 
investigated in the following sections. Like those classes 
where it was determined that only “some” verbs are 
compatible with CM, usefully incorporating the CM 
construction into classes that require coercion relies on 
accurately determining the probability that verbs in those 
classes will actually appear in the CM construction.
For those classes in which “all” verbs are compatible
with CM, our intuition was that some aspect of the verb‟s 
semantics either inherently includes or allows the verb to 
be coerced into the CM construction. Conversely, for 
those classes in which no verbs are compatible with CM, 
presumably some aspect of the verb‟s semantics is 
logically incompatible with CM. Although pinpointing


precisely what aspect of a verb‟s semantics makes it 
compatible with CM may not be possible, we can 
investigate whether or not our intuitions are supported by 
examining the actual frequencies of CM constructions for 
given verbs or a given class.

4.2     Hypotheses

Using these annotations, we were able to develop two 
simple hypotheses.
  Hypothesis 1: We expect the constructional profile 
measures for the CM construction in a given corpus to be
highest for those classes in which all verbs were found to 
be compatible with CM; lower for classes in which only
some verbs were found to be compatible; and lowest for 
classes in which no verbs were found to be compatible.
Hypothesis 2: We expect the constructional profile
measures for the CM construction in a given corpus to be 
highest for verbs that fall into classes where CM is not 
considered coerced (for either some or all of the verbs in 
the class); lower for verbs that fall into classes in which 
the CM construction only works through coercion (for 
either some or all of the verbs in the class); and lowest for 
verbs that fall into classes in which no verbs are 
compatible with CM.
  To investigate Hypothesis 1, we grouped the annotated 
classes according to whether all, some, or no verbs in the
class are compatible with CM:

  To investigate Hypothesis 2, we did a second grouping 
of the classes according to whether CM is not coerced, 
CM is coerced, or CM is simply not compatible with the 
class. This second grouping did not distinguish whether 
CM was compatible with “all” or “some” of the verbs in 
a given class.

5     Evaluation using Constructional Profiles

5.1     Annotated data description

Our research uses the data annotated for Hwang et al. 
(2010), in which 1800 instances in the form NP-V-NP- 
PP were identified in the Wall Street Journal portion of 
the Penn Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1994). Each instance


of the data was single annotated with one of the two 
labels: CM or non-CM. The annotation guidelines were 
based on the CM analysis of Goldberg (1995).
  Our analysis began with the same data but adopted a 
slightly narrower definition of CM. We diverged from
the Hwang et al. (2010) study in the following two ways:
(1) sentences where the object NP is an item that is 
created by the event denoted by the verb were not
considered CM (e.g., Mr. Pilson scribbled a frighteningly
large figure on a slip of paper, where the figure is created 
through the scribbling event); and (2) sentences in which 
movement is prevented were not considered CM (e.g., 
He kept her at arm’s length). In agreement with Hwang 
et al., our annotation included both metaphorical senses 
(e.g., [It] cast a shadow over world oil markets) and 
literal senses (e.g., The company moved the employees to 
New York) of CM. Our annotation using the narrower 
guidelines resulted in 85.8% agreement with the original 
annotation. 1  The distribution of labels in our data is
21.8% for CM and 78.2% for NON-CM.

5.2     Annotated data description

Using statistics over the manually annotated data, we 
calculate maximum likelihood estimates of the three 
constructional profile measures introduced in Section 3, 
as follows. First, let the probability that a verb v is used in 
the CM construction be estimated as:
P(CM|v,C) =	#(CM usages of 	)
#(CM+non-CM usages of	)
That is, P(CM|v,C) is estimated as the relative frequency
of the CM construction for v out of all annotated usages 
of v that are labeled as class C. Now let CCM be all verbs v 
in C with at least one usage annotated as CM; i.e.:
*	|   (	|	)	+
Then we calculate estimates of P1–P3 as:
P1: Ptype(CM|C) = |CCM |/|C|
This measure indicates how widespread the use of CM is
across the verb types in the class.
P2: Ptoken(CM|C) =,∑         (      |       )-⁄|  |
The average over all verbs v in C of P(CM|v,C)
This indicates the relative amount of usage of CM among 
all usages of the verbs in the class.
P3: Ptoken(CM|v,C) = [∑             (      |       ))-  |       |
The average over all verbs v in CCM of P(CM|v,C)
P3 narrows the P2 measure to only those verbs in the

the changes in annotation resulting from our two new criteria.


class for which there is an attested usage of CM.

5.3     Analysis of the Constructional Profiles

The tables below provide a summary of the profile 
measures P1-P3 for the groups of VerbNet classes as 
defined in section 4.2. For each group listed, we report 
the averages of P1-P3 over all classes in the group where 
at least one verb in the class occurred in the data 
manually annotated for CM usage.

As seen here, the constructional profile measures over
CM in the data corroborate our Hypothesis 1 (Section
4.2). All three measures on average are highest for the
classes that fall into the “all allowed” group, next highest 
for those in the “some allowed” group, and lowest for the 
“not allowed” classes.

Furthermore, the second table here confirms our 
expectations for Hypothesis 2 (Section 4.2). Again, all 
three measures on average are highest for classes that fall 
into the “non-coerced” group, next highest for classes in 
the “coerced” group (in which the construction is 
achievable only through coercion), and lowest for the 
“not allowed” group.
  Thus, our two hypotheses are borne out, showing that 
our constructional profile measures, when estimated over
manually annotated data, can  be useful in capturing
important distinctions among classes of verbs with regard 
to their usage in an extensible construction such as CM.

6     Automatic   Creation   of   Constructional
Profiles Using a Bayesian Model

Manually annotating a corpus for usages of a con- 
struction can be prohibitively expensive, so we also 
investigate the use of automatic methods to estimate 
constructional profile measures. By using a hierarchi-cal 
Bayesian model (HBM) that acquires latent prob-abilistic 
verb classes from corpus data, we provide unsupervised


2 Note the non-zero values result from actual CM verb usages in 
the data belonging to classes believed to be not compatible with 
CM by VerbNet expert annotators.


estimates of the constructional profiles.

6.1     Overview of Model and Data

We use the HBM of Parisien & Stevenson (2011), a 
model that automatically acquires probabilistic 
knowledge about verb argument structure and verb 
classes from large-scale corpora. The model is based on a 
large body of research in nonparametric Bayesian topic 
modeling (e.g., Teh et al., 2004), a robust method of 
discovering syntactic and semantic structure in very large 
datasets. For each verb encountered in a corpus, the 
model provides an estimate of the verb‟s expected overall 
pattern of usage. By using latent probabilistic verb classes 
to influence these expected usage patterns, the model can, 
for example, estimate the probability that a verb like blink 
might occur in a CM construction, even if no such 
attested usages appear in the corpus.
In this preliminary study, we use the corpus data from
Parisien & Stevenson (2011), since the model has been 
trained and evaluated on this data. As that study was 
aimed at modeling facts of child language acquisition, it 
uses child-directed speech from the Thomas corpus 
(Lieven et al., 2009), part of the CHILDES database 
(MacWhinney, 2000). In this preliminary study, we use 
their development dataset containing approx. 170,000 
verb usages, covering approx. 1,400 verb types. (We 
reserve the test set for future experiments.) For each verb 
usage in the input, a number of features are automatically 
extracted that indicate the number and type of syntactic 
arguments occurring with the verb and general semantic 
properties of the verb. The semantic features are drawn 
from the set of VerbNet semantic predicates, such as 
CAUSE, MOTION, and CONTACT. These are automatically 
extracted from all classes compatible with the verb (with 
no sense disambiguation).

6.2     Measures for Constructional Profiles

Using the argument structure constructions, verb usage 
patterns and classes learned by the model, we estimate 
the three constructional profile measures in Section 3, as 
follows. First, we note that since the constructions 
acquired by the model are probabilistic in nature, a 
particular CM instance may be a partial match to more 
than one of the model‟s constructions.
  For each verb in the input, we consider the likelihood 
of use of the CM construction to be the likelihood of a
contrived  frame  intended  to  capture  the  important
properties of a CM usage. FCM is a usage taking a direct 
object and a prepositional phrase, and including the 
semantic features CAUSE and MOTION, with all other 
semantic features left unspecified. For a given verb v, we


estimate the likelihood of this CM usage, over all 
constructions in the model, as follows:
(	|  )	∑ (	|  )  (   |  )
Here, P(FCM |k) is the likelihood of the CM usage FCM
being an instance of the probabilistic construction k, and
P(k|v) is the likelihood that verb v occurs with 
construction  k.  These  component  probabilities  are
estimated using the probability distributions acquired by
the model and averaged over 100 samples from the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, as described in
Parisien & Stevenson (2011).
  Now, we let CCM be the set of verbs in VerbNet class 
C where the expected likelihood of a CM usage is non- 
negligible (akin to the set of verbs with attested usage in 
Section 5.2):
CCM = {v C | P(FCM|v)>λ }
where λ is a small threshold, here 0.0001. Note that since 
v is not disambiguated for class in our data, all usages of v 
contribute to this estimate.
  The estimates of P1-P3 are comparable to those in 
Section 5.2. The difference is that since we are un-able to 
disambiguate individual usages of the verbs, each usage 
of v is considered to belong to all possible classes C of 
which v is a member. P1 is estimated as before; P2 and 
P3 are averages of P(FCM|v).

6.3     Analysis of the Constructional Profiles

The tables below provide a summary of the profile 
estimates P1-P3 for the groups of VerbNet classes as 
given in Section 4.2. For each group listed, we report the 
averages of P1-P3 over all classes in the group where at 
least one of the verbs in the class occurred in the training 
input to the model.

These profile measures align with the hypotheses in 
Section 4.2 and with the measures based on manually 
annotated data in Section 5.2. The estimates are high-est 
for classes where all verbs permit the CM con-struction, 
second highest for classes where only some permit it, and 
lowest for classes that do not permit it.


Again, the overall patterns of the profile measures align 
with Sections 4.2 and 5.2. The profile estimates are 
highest for classes annotated to be non-coerced usages of 
CM, second highest for coerced classes, and lowest for 
“not allowed”.
  The measures show the overall differences among 
classes in the different groups (for both groupings) – i.e.,
the average behavior among classes in the different 
groups varies as we predicted.  This indicates that the
measures are tapping into aspects of construction usage 
that are relevant to making the desired distinctions in 
VerbNet,    and    validates   the    use   of   automatic
techniques.  However, there is a substantial amount of 
variability in these measures across the classes, so we also
consider how well the estimates can predict the 
appropriate group for individual classes. That is, can we
automatically predict whether the CM construction can 
be used by all, some, or none of the verbs in a given verb 
class,  and  can  we  predict  whether  such  usages  are
coerced?
  We consider the P3 measure as it provides the best 
separation among the class groupings. The tables below
report precision (P), recall (R) and F-measures (F) for
each group, where „all‟ and „some‟ have been collapsed.
For exploratory purposes, we pick P3 = 0.006 as the 
value that optimizes F-measures of this classification. 
Future work will explore more principled means for 
setting these thresholds.

Only a 2-way distinction can be made reliably for the 
allowed grouping. The F-score of over 80% for the 
“allowed” label is very promising. The low precision for 
the “not allowed” case suggests that the model can‟t 
generalize sufficiently due to sparse data.

We use thresholds of P3 = 0.021 to separate non-coerced 
from coerced classes, and P3 = 0.007 to separate coerced 
from not allowed classes. The model estimates show 
moderate success in distinguishing classes with coerced 
vs. non-coerced usage of the CM construction. However, 
our measures simply cannot distinguish non-occurrence 
due to semantic incompatibility from non-occurrence due 
to chance, given the expected low frequency of a novel


coerced use of a construction.  To separate the allowed 
cases into whether they are coerced or not requires a 
more detailed assessment of the semantic compatibility of 
the class, which means looking at finer-grained features 
of verb usages that are indicative of the semantic 
predicates compatible with the particular construction. 
Moreover, this kind of assessment likely needs to be 
applied on a verb-specific (and not just class-specific) 
level, in order to identify those verbs out of a potentially 
coercible class that are indeed coercible (i.e., identifying 
the coercible verbs in a class labeled as "some allowed").

7     Conclusion

Our investigation demonstrates that VerbNet does not 
currently represent the CM construction for all verbs or 
verb classes that are compatible with this construction, 
and the existing static representation of verbs is 
inadequate for analyzing extensions of verb meaning 
brought about by coercion. The utility of VerbNet would 
be greatly enhanced by an improved representation of 
constructions: specifically, the incorporation of 
probabilities that verbs in a given (sub)class would occur 
in a particular construction, and whether this constitutes a 
regular sense extension. This addition to VerbNet would 
increase the resource‟s coverage of syntactic frames that 
are compatible with a given verb, and therefore enable 
appropriate inferences when coercion occurs. We have 
made preliminary steps towards developing this 
probabilistic distribution over both verb instances and 
classes, based on a large corpus. Unsupervised methods 
for estimating the probabilities achieve an F-score of over
80% in distinguishing the classes that allow the target 
construction. However, making distinctions among 
coerced and non-coerced cases will require us to go 
beyond these class-based probabilities to finer-grained, 
corpus-based assessments of a verb‟s semantic 
compatibility with a coercible construction.
  To move beyond these preliminary findings, we must 
therefore shift our focus to the behavior of individual
verbs.  Additionally,  to  reduce  the  impact  of  errors
resulting from low-frequency verbs and classes, we plan 
to expand our research to more data, specifically the
OntoNotes TreeBank data (Weischedel et al., 2011).
Finally, to achieve our ultimate goal of creating a lexicon 
that can flexibly account for a variety of constructions, we 
will examine other constructions as well. While 
determining the set of coercible constructions in a 
language is itself a topic of current research, we propose 
initially to include the widely recognized CAUSE- 
RECEIVE and WAY constructions in addition to CM.
