Abstract
None

The meaning of a sentence is an essential aspect of 
natural language understanding, yet an elusive one, 
since there is no accepted methodology for determin- 
ing it. There is not even a consensus on criteria for 
distinguishing word senses. Clearly a more robust 
technology is needed that uses data-driven techniques. 
These techniques typically rely on supervised machine 
learning, so a critical goal is the definition of a level of 
semantic representation (sense tags and semantic role 
labels) that could be consistently annotated on a large 
scale.  We have been training automatic WSD systems 
on the English sense-tagged training data based on 
WordNet that we supplied to SENSEVAL2 (Dang & 
Palmer, 2002).  A pervasive problem with sense tag- 
ging is finding a sense inventory with clear criteria for 
sense distinctions.  WordNet is often criticized for its 
subtle and fine-grained sense distinctions.   Perhaps 
more consistent and coarse-grained sense distinctions 
would be more suitable for natural language process- 
ing  applications.    Grouping  the  highly  polysemous 
verb senses in WordNet (on average reducing the >16 
senses per verb to 8) provides an important first step a 
more flexible granularity for WordNet senses that im- 
proves both inter-annotator agreement (71% to 82%) 
and system performance (60.2% to 69%) (Dang & 
Palmer, 2002).  The Frameset sense tags associated 
with the PropBank, as discussed below, provide an 
even more coarse-grained and easily replicable level 
of sense distinctions.

Based on a consensus of colleagues participating in the 
ACE  (Automatic  Content  Extraction)  program,  we 
have  developed  a  Proposition  Bank,  or  PropBank, 
which provides semantic role labels for verbs and par- 
ticipial modifiers for the 1M word Penn Treebank II 
corpus (Marcus, 1994).   VerbNet classes have proved 
invaluable for defining the appropriate semantic roles 
in this endeavor (Dang, et. al., 1998).   For example, 
John is the Agent or Arg0 of John broke the window, 
IBM is the Theme or Arg1 of IBM rose 1.2 points. In 
addition,  for  just  over  700  of  the  most  polysemous 
verbs in the Penn TreeBank, we have defined two or 
more Framesets – major sense distinctions based on 
differing sets of semantic roles (Palmer, et al, submit- 
ted).  These Framesets overlap closely (95%) with our 
manual  groupings  of  the  SENSEVAL2  verb  senses,


and thus they can be combined to provide an hierarchi- 
cal set of sense distinctions.  The PropBank is complete 
and a beta-release version was made publicly available 
through LDC in February for use in the CoNLL-04 
shared task.  There is a complementary lexicography 
project at Berkeley, Chuck Fillmore’s FRAMENET, 
which provides representative annotated samples rather 
than broad-coverage annotation, and there are current 
plans to combine these resources and train automatic 
labelers for English and Chinese. The automatic se- 
mantic role labelers we are building use features that 
are very similar to our WSD system features, and we 
find that semantic role label features improve WSD 
while sense tag features improve semantic role labeling 
(Gildea & Palmer, 2002).
