Abstract
 
 
We present a Parameterized Action Representation
(PAR) that provides a conceptual representation of
different types of actions used to animate virtual hu-
man agents in a simulated 3D environment. These
actions involve changes of state, changes of location
(kinematic) and exertion of force (dynamic). PARS
are hierarchical, parameterized structures that fa-
cilitate both visual and verbal expressions. In or-
der to support the animation of the actions, PARS
have to make explicit many details that are often un-
derspecified in the language. This detailed level of
representation also provides a suitable pivot repre-
sentation for generation in other natural languages,
i.e., a form of interlingua. We show examples of
how certain divergences in machine translation can
be solved by our approach focusing specifically on
how verb-framed and satellite-framed languages can
use our representation.
 
 
1 Introduction
 
 
In this paper, we describe a Parameterized Ac-
tion Representation (PAR) (Badler et al., 1999)
that provides a conceptual representation of differ-
ent types of actions used to animate virtual human
agents in a simulated 3D environment. These ac-
tions involve changes of state, changes of location
(kinematic) and exertion of force (dynamic). PARS
are hierarchical, parameterized structures that fa-
cilitate both visual and verbal expressions (Badler
et al., 2000). In order to support the animation of
the actions, PARS have to make explicit many de-
tails that are often underspecified in the language.
This detailed level of representation is well suited
for an interlingua for machine translation applica-
tions, since the animations of actions — and there-
fore the PARS that control them — will be equiva-
lent for the same actions described in different lan-
guages. These representations can be incorporated
into a system which uses PAR-based animations as
a workbench for creating accurate conceptual rep-
resentations, which can map to seeral different lan-
guages as well as produce faithful animations.
The verb classes we are currently considering in
this light involve explicit physical actions such as
those expressed in the motion verb class and con-
tact verb class (Levin, 1993). Since we are employ-
ing PAR as an interlingual representation, we will
show examples of how it can handle certain diver-
gences in machine translation, focusing specifically
on how verb-framed and satellite-framed languages
(Talmy, 1991) can yield equivalent actions in this
representation.
 
 
2 PAR representation
 
 
We use parameterized action representations to ani-
mate the actions of virtual human agents. The PAR
for an action includes the action&apos;s participants (its
agent and objects),&apos; as well as kinematic properties
such as its path, manner and duration, and dynamic
properties, such as its speed and force (see Fig. 1).
The representation also allows for traditional state-
space properties of actions, such as applicability con-
ditions and preparatory actions that have to be satis-
fied before the action can be executed, and termina-
tion conditions and post assertions which determine
when an action is concluded and what changes it
makes to the environment state.
We created a hierarchy of actions, exploiting the
idea that verbs can be represented in a lattice that
allows semantically similar verbs, such as motion
verbs or verbs of contact, to be closely associated
with each other under a common parent that cap-
tures the properties these verbs all share (Dang et
al., 1998). The highest nodes in the hierarchy are
occupied by generalized PAR schemas which repre-
sent the basic predicate-argument structures for en-
tire groups of subordinate actions. The lower nodes
are occupied by progressively more specific schemas
that inherit information from the generalized PARS,
and can be instantiated with arguments from natu-
ral language to represent a specific action such as
John hit the ball with his bat. The example in Fig-
ure 1 is a generalized PAR schema for contact ac-
 
 
&apos;Objects and agents are stored in a hierarchy and have
a number of properties associated with them. Properties of
the objects may include their location and status. Agents
have capabilities, such as the ability to walk or swim, and
properties such as their strength and height.

tions between two objects. This schema specifies
that the `contact&apos; action has an agent and two ob-
jects, and that the action is concluded when the two
objects come together.2 The preparatory specifica-
tion of getting the second object is tested and car-
ried out if the object is not possessed. In order to
describe a specific action, say hammer, we would
combine all of its ancestor representations in the ac-
tion hierarchy, as shown in Figure 2, and add the
information specific to that action. Since hammer
inherits from the PAR for hit, and ultimately from
the PAR for contact, its representation would use
the generalized `contact&apos; PAR, with a forceful man-
ner, and a hammer as the instrument. The action
hit does not specify any instrument, but inherits the
forceful manner and generalized contact PAR from
its ancestors, and the action contact leaves both the

instrument and the manner unspecified, and is asso-
ciated only with the generalized contact PAR.
The PAR is intended to provide slots for infor-
mation that is typically conveyed in modifiers or ad-
juncts in addition to internal verb arguments. As
such, it is often the case that several different syn-
tactic realizations can all map to the same PAR
schema. For example, John hit the ball, John hit
the ball with a bat and John swung mightily and his
bat hit the ball with a resounding crack would all map
to the same schema.3
 
 
3 Generating Animations
 
 
The main components of our animation system are:
a natural language interface, a planner and a graphi-
cal animation (see Figure 3). The PARS are used as
intermediate representations of the actions between
components.
An instruction in natural language starts the pro-
cess. We use a Synchronous Tree Adjoining Gram-
mar (Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Shieber, 1994) for
parsing natural language instructions into deriva-
tions containing predicate-argument dependencies
(Schuler, 1999). The synchronous parser extracts
these predicate-argument structures by first asso-
ciating each word in an input sentence with one
or more elementary trees, which are combined into
a single derivation tree for the entire input sen-
tence using the constrained operations of substitu-
tion and adjunction in the Tree Adjoining Grammar
formalism (Joshi, 1985; Joshi, 1987). As the parser
assembles these elementary tree predicates into a
predicate-argument structure, it simultaneously se-
lects and assembles the corresponding schemas. It
fills in the participants and modifiers, and outputs
the PAR schema for the instruction. These schemas
may be underspecified for actions such as `enter&apos; or
`put&apos; and thus not provide enough information for
the animation to be produced directly.
 
 
3The relationship between PARS and alternations may be-
come much more complicated when we consider other verb
classes such as change of state verbs.

Figure 3: General architecture of the animation system
 
 
The planner uses information from the general
schema, such as pre-conditions and post-assertions,
as well as information derived from the agents&apos; ca-
pabilities and the objects properties to fill in these
gaps in several ways:
 
 
• to select the way (activity) in which the instruc-
tion is performed (enter by walking, by swim-
ming, etc.);
• to determine the prepartory actions that must
be completed before the instruction is carried
out, (for example, in order for an agent to open
the door, the door has to be reachable and that
may involve a locomotion process);
• to decompose the action into smaller units (put
the glass on the table, involves getting the glass,
planning a route to the table, etc.)
 
 
The output of the planner for the input instruction
is a complete description of the actions involved, in-
cluding participants, preparatory specifications, ter-
mination conditions, manner, duration, etc. Partic-
ipants bring with them a list of inherent properties
of the agent (e.g. agent capabilities) or physical ob-
jects (e.g., object configurations) and other charac-
teristics, such as &apos;how to open&apos; for an object such
as a door. This complete description refers to a set
of animation PARS which can be immediately ani-
mated.
In this way, a PAR schema for the action enter
may actually translate into an animation PAR for
walking into a certain area. One way to differenti-
ate between action PAR schemas and instantiated
animation PARs is to consider what it is possible to
motion capture&apos; (by attaching sensors to a moving
human figure). For example, the enter action and
the put action are quite general and underspecified
and could not be motion captured. However, char-
acteristic activities such as walking and swimming
could be. For further details about the animation
PARS and the animation system see (Badler et al,
1999) and (Bindiganavale at al., 2000).
 
 
4 PAR as an IL
 
 
The PAR representation for an action can be seen as
a general template. PAR schemas include, as part
of the basic sub-categorization frame, properties of

example, through inverse kinematics, dynamics and key-
framing.
 
 
the action that can occur linguistically either as the
main verb or as adjuncts to the main verb phrase.
This captures problems of divergences, such as the
ones described by Talmy (Talmy, 1991), for verb-
framed versus satellite-framed languages.
New information may come from a sentence in
natural language that modifies the action&apos;s inherent
properties, such as in John hit the ball slowly, where
&apos;slowly&apos; is not part of the initial representation of
the action &apos;hit&apos;. This new information is added to
the PAR schema.
Verb- versus Satellite-framed languages
Verb-Framed Languages (VFL) map the motion
(path or path + ground location) onto the verb,
and the manner either onto a satellite or an ad-
junct, while Satellite-Framed Languages (SFL) map
the motion into the satellite, and the manner onto
the main verb.
English and other Germanic languages are consid-
ered satellite-framed languages, expressing the path
in the satellite; Spanish, among other Romance lan-
guages, is a verb-framed language and expresses the
path in the main verb. The pairs of sentences (1)
and (2) from Talmy (1991) show examples of these
divergences. In (I), in English, the exit of the bot-
tle is expressed by the preposition out, in Spanish
the same concept is incorporated in the main verb
salir (to exit). In (2), the concept of blowing out
the candle is represented differently in English and
Spanish.
 
 
(1) The bottle floated out
La botella solid flotando
(the bottle exited floating)
(2) I blew out the candle
Apague la vela sopldndola
(I extinguish the candle blowing)
 
 
4.1 Motion
 
 
In order to capture generalizations about motion ac-
tions, we have a generalized PAR schema for mo-
tion, and our hierarchy includes different types of
motion actions such as inherently directed motion
and manner of motion actions that inherit from the
more general schema, as shown in Figure 4. Directed
motion actions, such as enter and exit, don&apos;t bring
with them the manner by which the action is carried
out but they have a inherent termination condition.
For example, &apos;enter a room&apos; may be done by walk-
ing, crawling or flying depending on the agents&apos; ca-

pabilities, but it should end when the agent is in the
room. In contrast, manner of motion verbs express
the action explicitly and don&apos;t have an intrinsic ter-
mination condition.
Motion is a type of framing event where the path
is in the main verb for VFLs and in the satellite for
SFLs. In (3), we see the English sentence expressing
the &apos;enter&apos; idea in the preposition into whereas the
Spanish sentence expresses it in the main verb entrar
(to enter).
(3) The bottle floated into the cave
La botella entrci flotando a la cueva
(the bottle entered floating the cave)
The PAR schemas don&apos;t distinguish the represen-
tation for these sentences, because there is a sin-
gle schema which includes both the manner and the
path without specifying how they are reabized lin-
guistically. Mappings from the lexical items to the
schemas or to constraints in the schemas can be seen
in Figure 5.5 Independent of which is the source lan-
guage, the PAR schema selected is motion, the ac-
tivity field, which determines how the action is per-
formed (in this case, by floating), is filled by float
(the main verb in English, or the adjunct in Span-
ish). The termination condition, which says that
action ends when the agent is in the object, is added
from the preposition in English and is part of the
semantics of the main verb to enter in Spanish.

to capture that distinction.

Comparison with other work
 
 
Our approach now diverges considerably from the
approach outlined in Palmer et al. (1998) which
discusses the use of Feature-Based Tree Adjoining
Grammars, (Joshi, 1985; Vijay-Shanker and Joshi,
1991) to capture generalizations about manner-of-
motion verbs. They do not propose an interlin-
gua but use a transfer-based mechanism expressed
in Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars to cap-
ture divergences of VFL and SF% through the use
of semantic features and links between the gram-
mars. The problem of whether or not a preposi-
tional. phrase constitutes an argument to a verb or
an adjunct (described by Palmer et al.) does not
constitute a problem in our representation, since all
the information is recovered in the same template
for the action to be animated.
The PAR approach is much more similar to
the Lexical Conceptual Structures (LOS) approach,
(Jacicendoff, 1972; Jackendoff, 1990), used as an in-
terlingua representation (Dorr, 1993). Based on the
assumption that motion and manner of motion are
conflated in a matrix verb like swim, the use of LCS
allows separation of the concepts of motion, direc-
tion, and manner of motion in the sentence John
swam across the lake. Each one of these concepts is
 
 
participants :
 
 
15
 
 
represented separately in the interlingua represen-
tation, as GO, PATH and MANNER, respectively.
Our approach allows for a similar representation and
the end result is the same, namely that the event of
swimming across the lake is characterized by sepa-
rate semantic components, which can be expressed
by the main schema and by the activity field. In ad-
dition, our representation also incorporates details
about the action such as applicability conditions,
preparatory specifications, termination conditions,
and adverbial modifiers. It is not clear to us how
the LCS approach could be used to effect the same
commonality of representation.
 
 
4.2 Instrument
 
 
The importance of the additional information such
as the termination conditions can be more clearly
illustrated with a different set of examples. Another
class of actions that presents interesting divergences
involves instruments where the instrument is used
as the main verb or as an adjunct depending on the
language. The sentence pair in (4) shows this di-
vergence for English and Portuguese. Because Por-
tuguese does not have a verb for to spoon, it uses
a more general verb colocar (to put) as the main
verb and expresses the instrument in a prepositional
phrase. Unlike directed motion actions, a put with
hand-held instrument action (e.g., spoon, scoop, la-
dle, etc.) leaves the activity field unspecified in both
languages. The specific action is generated by taking
the instrument into account. A simplified schema is
shown in Figure 7.

Notice that the only connection between to spoon
and its Portuguese translation would be the termi-
nation condition where the object of the verb, choco-
late, has a new location which is over the ice cream.
 
 
5 Conclusion
 
 
We have discussed a parameterized representation
of actions grounded by the needs of animation of
instructions in a simulated environment. In order
to support the animation of these instructions, our
representation makes explicit many details that are
often underspecified in the language, such as start
and end states and changes in the environment that
happen as a result of the action.
Sometimes the start and end state information
provides critical information for accurate translation
but it is not always necessary. Machine translation
can often simply preserve ambiguities in the transla-
tion without resolving them. In our application we
cannot afford this luxury. An interesting question
to pursue for future work will be whether or not we
can determine which PAR slots are not needed for
machine translation purposes.
Generalizations based on action classes provide
the basis for an interlingua approach that captures
the semantics of actions without committing to any
language-dependent specification. This framework
offers a strong foundation for handling the range
of phenomena presented by the machine translation
task.
The structure of our PAR schenaas incorpo-
rate into a single template the kind of divergence
presented in verb-framed and satellite-framed lan-
guages. Although not shown in this paper, this
representation can also capture idioms and non-
compositional constructions since the animations of
actions — and therefore the PARS that control them
— must be equivalent for the same actions described
in different languages.
Currently, we are also investigating the possibility
of building these action representations from a class-
based verb lexicon which has explicit syntactic and
semantic information (Kipper et at,, 2000).
