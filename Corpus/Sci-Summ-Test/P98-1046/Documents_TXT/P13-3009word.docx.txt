Abstract

Natural language can be easily understood by 
everyone irrespective  of their differences  in 
age or region or qualification. The existence 
of a conceptual base that underlies all natural 
languages is an accepted claim as pointed out 
by Schank in his Conceptual Dependency 
(CD) theory. Inspired by the CD theory and 
theories  in Indian  grammatical  tradition,  we 
propose  a new set of meaning primitives  in 
this  paper. We  claim  that this  new set  of 
primitives  captures  the meaning  inherent  in 
verbs and help in forming an inter-lingual and 
computable ontological classification of 
verbs. We  have identified  seven  primitive 
overlapping  verb senses  which substantiate 
our claim.  The percentage  of  coverage  of 
these  primitives  is  100% for  all  verbs in 
Sanskrit  and  Hindi and  3750 verbs in 
English.

1    Introduction

Communication in natural language is simple. 
Looking at the ease to learn and communicate in 
and across natural languages, the claim of 
existence of interlingual conceptual base (Schank, 
1972) seems plausible .
   Conceptual Dependency (CD) theory tried to 
represent  a conceptual base using a small set of
meaning  primitives.  To achieve  this  goal, they
put forward a proposal consisting of a small set 
of 12 primitive  actions,  a  set  of dependencies 
which connects the primitive actions  with each 
other and with their actors, objects, instruments, 
etc.  Their claim was  that this small set  of 
representational elements could be used to 
produce  a canonical form for sentences in 
English as  well as  other natural languages. 
Representational theories like Scripts, Plans, 
Goals and Understanding(SPGU)  representations


(Schank   and  Abelson,  1977) were  developed 
from the CD theory. None of the descendant 
theories  of CD could focus on the notion of
'primitives' and the idea faded in the subsequent 
works.
  Identification of meaning primitives is an area 
intensely explored and a vast number of theories
have been put forward, namely, (PRO: 
Conceptual     semantics     (Jackendoff,     1976),
Meaning-text theory (Mel’čuk,1981),   Semantic
Primes (Wierzbicka, 1996),    Conceptual 
dependency  theory (Schank,  1972) Preference
Semantics (Wilks, 1975) CONTRA: Language of
Thought (Fodor, 1975)). Through our work, we 
put forward  a  set  of seven meaning  primitives 
and claim that the permutation/combination of 
these seven meaning primitives along with 
ontological  attributes  is  sufficient  to develop  a 
computational model for meaning representation 
across languages.
This	paper	looks	at 	the	Conceptual
Dependency  Theory created  by Roger Schank 
(Schank, 1973; Schank, 1975) and compares  it 
with theories in Indian grammatical tradition. We 
discuss these in section 2 and section 3. We then 
analyze if we can modify Schank's approach to 
define a  more  efficient  set  of primitives.  We 
conclude by introducing the small set of meaning 
primitives  which we  have found to cover all 
verbs in Indian  languages  like Sanskrit,  Hindi 
and almost all verbs in English.

2    Conceptual Dependency

According to Schank,  linguistic  and situational 
contexts in which a sentence  is uttered is 
important for understanding the meaning of that 
sentence. The CD theory was developed to create 
a  theory of human  natural language 
understanding. The initial premise of the theory

is: basis of natural language is conceptual. 
According to the theory, during communication, 
to-and-fro mapping happens between linguistic 
structures and the conceptual base through 
concepts.  It  is due to the existence  of this 
conceptual base and concept based mapping that 
a person,  who is multilingual, is able to switch 
between languages easily.
  The conceptual base consists of concepts and 
the relations  between  concepts.  Therefore,  it is 
responsible for formally representing the 
concepts underlying an utterance. There are three 
types of concepts: a) nominal; b) action and   c) 
modifier.  We will  concentrate only on  'action' 
since our work is related to verbs.
  CD’s basic premise is that the ACTION is the 
basis of any proposition that is not descriptive of
a  static  piece  of the world. Conceptualization
consists of action, actors  and  cases that are 
dependent on that action. An ACTOR is defined 
as an animate object and an OBJECT  as any 
concrete physical entity. CD representations use


century BC) put forward the bhāva-based 
definition to define all types of verbs. According 
to Nirukta verse  1.1 (Sarup,  1920) the 
characteristic that defines a verb form is its verb 
having bhāva  as  its principal meaning.  In 
Sanskrit,   bhāva is   a   morphological   form  of 
bhavati   and   bhavati means   'happening'. So 
structure of  bhāva can be defined as structure  of 
happening which is explained in section 4.1.
According to sage Vārsyāyaṇi, Nirukta verse
1.2 (Sarup, 1920),  there are 6 variants of bhāva 
or verb which, we believe, can be compared to 6 
fundamental processes. That is, a process  'verb' 
consists of six stages. They are:
coming into being - jāyate
                  'is born, comes into being' 
existing	- asti 'is'
changing                 - vipariṇamate
                    'undergoes modification' 
increasing	- vardhate
                   'grows, increases' 
diminishing	- apaksÍ yate  'diminishes'

constructed.

many varied combinations to express the 
meaning of what underlies a given word. In CD, 
primitives were arrived at by noticing structural 
similarities that existed when sentences were put 
into an actor-action-object framework. Using 
these  acts,  set  of states  and  set  of conceptual 
roles, it is possible to express  a large amount of 
the meanings expressible in a natural language.

3    Indian grammatical tradition

The Nirukta1(Sarup,1920; Kunjunni et. al., 1990) 
statement "Verbs have operation as its 
predominant element" proposes that “process” is 
the most important  element  in a  verb. As  all 
words can be derived from verbal roots, we can 
say that words in a natural  language  are either 
activities  (verbs) or derived from some activity 
(nouns). For example:
   rājā  (king) is  derived from (the root) rāj  (to 
shine)
  vṛkṣa (tree) is derived from (the root) vṛ (to 
cover) kṣā (the earth)
Verb is called kriyā in Sanskrit. kriyā stands


We  are  trying to use  existing  theories  in the
traditional school of Sanskrit language, namely, 
Navya-Nyāya for identification and formal 
representation of primitive actions. We work 
within the formal framework of Neo- Vaisé sika 
Formal Ontology (NVFO)2.

4.1 Form of verb

Happening is formally conceived as punctuation 
between two discrete  states in a context.  Since 
every happening consists of minimally two 
different states, there is an atomic sense of 
movement in it. Movement  means whenever an 
action takes place two states come into existence. 
The initial state, at the beginning of an action and 
a final state, after the completion of the action. 
The two states can be same or different. Time is 
an inseparable part of this structure because 
between  initial  and  final  states there  can  be n 
number of  intermediate  states  which are 
sequential.
  Happening (Sanskrit, bhavati) is the change of 
state from one to another in a context.  According
to Bhartṛihari (5th  century  CE) every verb has


for  action  or  activity.  Verbs  consists  of  both	 	


action  and  state  verbs.  Sage  Kātyāyana   (3rd

2 Vaisesika ontology, due to Kaṇāda (Rensink, 2004), Pras
astapāda (Hutton,  2010) and Udayana (Kaṇāda, 1986) has 
been formalized  by Navjyoti (Tavva and Singh, 2010).






'sense of sequence' and 'state' in it. Hence, every 
verb projects  a 'sense of happening', making this 
sense  omnipresent in all verbs.  Therefore, 
bhavati is a  'universal verb'. In the 
nominalization of bhavati, 'bhāva3'  has a formal 
structure  and has been named 'punct'4.  The 
formal   representation   of  bhāva is   shown  in 
Figure1.
The structure of (universal verb) 'punct' is:
< state1 | state2, (Context)  Feature Space >
  The structure can also be represented in short 
format as:   < s1 / s2 | FS (C)>

Context


identifying frequent  verbs is  explained  using  a 
sample verb 'fall':
Definitions of different verb senses of ‘fall’ from 
two different sources are given below:
Source 1 (Dictionary.com):
(to drop or descend under the force of gravity, 
as  to a  lower  place  through loss  or lack  of
support), (to come or drop down suddenly to a
lower position, especially to leave a standing  or 
erect position suddenly, whether voluntarily or 
not), (to become  less  or lower;  become  of a 
lower level, degree, amount,  quality, value, 
number, etc.; decline)
Source 2 (WordNet):
(descend  in  free  fall  under  the  influence  of

in size, extent, or 
range), (move 
downward  and

necessarily all  the 
way),  (move in a  
specified  
direction),
(lose   an   upright  
position  
suddenly),   (drop


Figure1. Structure of happening
  From Sanskritist tradition, we have adopted the 
concept  of universal verb. Our original 
contribution is  that we  have  defined  an 
ontological  structure  (see Figure1)  to represent
‘universal verb’ and have used it to represent the 
seven primary verb senses (primitives) which we 
have identified.   All verbs in a language can be 
represented formally using this structure.

4.2	Identifying	Overlapping	Verbal 
senses

Can we have a few number of primitive meaning 
senses  whose   permutation  /  combination will 
enable us to explain all meanings in a language? 
Primitive verb senses in language were identified 
using an  approach   similar  to  Lesk’s  method 
(Lesk,  1986) of finding meaning  overlaps  for 
solving Word  Sense Disambiguation problem.
  All verbs and definitions of all senses of each 
verb in  Sanskrit   (2500) and   3750 verbs in
English  were  collected.  The verb senses  were
collected  from various on-line  dictionaries  in 
both the languages. From these definitions, verbs 
which are used to explicate defined verbs were 
identified.     The    procedure     followed     for


3 Bhāva is defined by Patañjali as (1)existence, 
(2)something that comes into being, and (3) 
something that is brought into being.
4 The formalization in NVFO is based on the idea of


oneself to a lower or less erect position) are few 
senses.
  All words in bold represent ‘movement’ in a 
negative  manner.  Since  movement  is  the most
common concept,   ‘move’   is   taken    as   an
overlapping primitive verb sense.  Other 
primitives like know, do, is, have, cut, and cover 
were obtained by similar procedure.
  In dictionaries,  overlapping  verb senses used 
to explicate meaning of defined verbs, show the
relatedness   of  two  verbs. The  phenomenon
known as  'Dictionary circularity'  (Wierzbicka,
1996) confirms the existence of this claim.
  In WordNet, the existence of most frequently 
used  verbs is  represented  through 8 ‘common 
verbs’ (Miller et. al, 1990):  have/ has, be, make, 
run, set,  go, take  and  get. State  is  dealt  with 
separately  in WordNet.  We have modified  the
‘common verbs’ concept of WordNet to include 
the concept of verbiality – the ability to denote a
process developing in time (Lyudmila, 2010).
  To analyze the phenomena  of overlapping 
meanings of verbs, we studied verbs from a 
database  of 3750 verbs and  two other lexical 
resources:WordNet, Webster English Dictionary. 
From the word frequencies of the verbs in these 
three resources, we calculated the percentages5 of 
overlapping verb senses used  to explicate 
meaning of defined verbs. The results are shown 
in Table 1. Total verbs (unique word forms) in 
the three resources –


an ontological form which is recursive. This form is	 	


called 'punct'. Using punct's categories of Vaisé́  sika 
ontology  can be derived.


5 Percentage is calculated taking the frequency 
of a verb w.r.t the total verbs in the particular 
source.

Table1. Sample data of percentages of verbs in three 
resources.
   When  verbs and their definitions in English 
language were analyzed it was found that basic
verb senses  like 'know', 'do', 'have', 'move',  'is',
'cut', and  'cover' have  higher frequency.  The 
occurrence of higher frequencies of some verbs 
indicated  that those  were  the verbs with 
maximum meaning  sense overlap with other 
verbs.

4.3 The Seven Puncts

In order  to handle  similarities  and  overlaps  in 
meaning  we  have developed  the concept  of 
overlapping  verbal sense  or 'punct'. These 
primitive verbal senses  are  intended to be 
building blocks out of which meaning of verbs 
can  be constructed.  We  have identified  seven
'puncts'. Two works WordNet (8 common verbs)
and Nirukta (6 fundamental processes) were 
influential  in  restricting  the number of 
overlapping verb senses to 7. We have modified 
the 8 common verbs in WordNet  (have, be, get,



Do	58.90	56.99

Have	4.12	7.79

Is	6.36	7.41

Cut	3.22	7.06

Cover	4.75	4.07
Table2. Percentage6 of coverage of the seven verb 
senses (puncts)  in English & Sanskrit
   Using  this  set of 7 'puncts' it is  possible  to 
express meaning inherent in verbs in a language
and   also   to  link   the  related   verbs across
languages. We will explain this by a deeper 
analysis of the seven 'puncts' (see Table 3).
    The 'punct' can  be  used  for  identifying 
similarities  between verbs like 'fall',  'plummet',
'flow' all of which have 'move'  as primary sense 
and they can be used for finding out different
senses of the same verb like 'break'. Thus 'break' 
can have primary  sense  of 'cut' and secondary
sense of 'do' when the meaning is 'to destroy or 
stop or interrupt or cause something  to separate
something'.   Similarly,   'break'   can   also   have
'move' as  primary  sense  and  'is'  as  secondary 
sense  when the meaning  is  'voice  change of a
person or day or dawn break or breaking news '.
Though  a verb can have two to all seven verbal 
senses, we are grouping  verbs looking at just the 
primary and secondary verb senses. A verb can 
be in  more  than one group. Once  they are 
classified according to their primary and 
secondary meanings we put verbs in groups, say 
all verbs having 'move' as primary sense and 'do' 
as secondary  sense will be in a group.

primitive meaning  sense can be represented  as a 
combination  of ‘state’  and  ‘change’.  Concepts
like exist  and un-exist,  join and un-join, know

Table3. Puncts


  We believe that every word is distinct. 'There 
are  no real  synonyms  and  that no two words 
have exactly  the same meaning'  (Palmer,  1986 
page-89). If all  words are distinct  how can we
show  its  distinctness?  We  have observed  that 
there is at least one ontological attribute which 
makes each word different from the other. They 
are called ontological attributes as they are 
concepts like space, time, manner, reason and 
sub-features like direction-linear, source, 
destination, effect etc. which can be represented 
inter-lingually.  We  have named  the set  of 
attributes as 'feature set'. Feature set is a part of 
the context C defined in the structure of 'punct'.
Verbs with same feature set across languages can 
be cross-linked.  For example,  if  we  want  to 
represent verb ‘breathe’ in another language, we 
just have  to map  the attributes    identified  for
‘breathe’ which are –
breathe1) move, instrument-lungs, object-air, 
manner-into and out of
breathe2) say, object-something, manner- very 
quietly
breathe3)  open, object-wine bottle, duration-
short time, purpose-improve flavor.

6       Issue and Solution

The uniform identification of verb sense means 
identifying the most general sense attached  to a 
verb, as done by an ordinary  person. One can see 
that more than one verb can be used to explicate 
the meaning of a verb and there is  an order in 
which the verbs  are  used.  This  order  helps  in 
finding the primary, secondary  and tertiary 
meaning senses.  The order is found by 
nominalizing verbs in a  simple  sentence.  This 
method helps in resolving inconsistencies, if any, 
while identifying meaning senses. For example:
─ you confuse me -> you create {confusion in 
me} →
─You create  {{confused  (state  of Knowledge)
about something (object of knowledge)} in me}
→
─ {You  do creation  of}  {{‘Confused  (state  of 
Knowledge) about something (object of 
knowledge)} in me}.
In the last sentence: ‘do’ is tertiary sense, ‘know’
is secondary  sense and ‘is {state of knowledge}
‘is the primary sense of verb ‘confuse’.
  The seven verb senses  thus identified are the 
building blocks out of which meanings of verbs 
are constructed.  The primary and secondary 
senses of all verbs in English and Sanskrit were 
identified. For English verbs, the entire verb list 
(3750) enlisted by Levin (Levin, 1993) including 
extensions  (Dang  et.  al,  1998; Kipper et.  al,
2006; Korhonen and  Briscoe,  2004) was 
classified  according  to the new classification.
For Sanskrit verbs, data (more  than 3000 verbs
(Sanskrit  dhātu7) including variations  in 
accentuation)    was    collected    from   various
resources (Palsule, 1955; Palsule, 1961; Liebich,
1922; Varma,  1953; Kale,  1961; Apte,  1998; 
Williams, 2008; Capeller, 1891). The meanings
of  English  verbs  were  obtained  from various

is as follows :- An item which denotes by its intrinsic 
denotative nature something that is brought into being


groups (all  verbs with the same  primary  verb
senses  formed  one group). The annotation  of 
verbs was  done for  four languages:  Sanskrit, 
English, Hindi and Telugu. Verbs in Sanskrit and 
English were compiled and annotated by one 
trained annotator  and  cross-checked  by an 
equally trained second annotator. The differences 
in annotation,  around  10%, were  resolved  by 
discussion. Annotation in Hindi and Telugu was 
done by 9 and 25 annotators respectively.  The 
annotators were  humans and native speakers of 
their languages, having an  idea of the  new 
approach. The average ratio of correctness was
64%. The classification was done manually.
   Based on this  classification  the verb groups 
formed have exhibited similarity in syntactic and
semantic   behavior. The  pattern   of  Stanford
dependency  relations  formed  among  verbs of

7    Conclusion

Conceptual  Dependency  theory  was  based on 
two assumptions:
1. If  two sentences  have  same  meaning  they 
must have similar  representation  regardless  of
the words used.
2. Information  implicitly stated in the sentence 
should be stated explicitly.
Our approach is based on two assumptions:
1. There is a conceptual base underlying all 
natural languages.
2. All content words are derived from verb root.
'Punct' is a mathematical representation of 
conceptual  base  in terms  of state  and  change
which can  be used  for computational  purpose.
Identification of overlapping verbal sense 
enables  a  classification based  on meaning. 
Verbal sense identification along with feature 
space which includes  ontological  attributes  can 
give a better  classification and understanding of 
verbs and  their  behavior.  Application  of  the 
concept  of  'punct' in  NLP  applications   like


- such a thing is referred to by the term bhāva or kriyā	 	


- is called dhātu
