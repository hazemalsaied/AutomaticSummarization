			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Syntax-based statistical machine translation (SSMT) has achieved significant progress during recent years (Galley et al., 2006; May and Knight, 2007; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), showing that deep linguistic knowledge, if used properly, can improve MT performance.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Semantics-based SMT, as a natural extension to SSMT, has begun to receive more attention from researchers (Liu and Gildea, 2008; Wu and Fung, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Semantic structures have two major advantages over syntactic structures in terms of helping machine translation.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">First of all, semantic roles tend to agree better between two languages than syntactic constituents (Fung et al., 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">This property motivates the approach of using the consistency of semantic roles to select MT outputs (Wu and Fung, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Secondly, the set of semantic roles of a predicate models the skeleton of a sentence, which is crucial to the readability of MT output.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">By skeleton, we mean the main structure of a sentence including the verbs and their arguments.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">In spite of the theoretical potential of the semantic roles, there has not been much success in using them to improve SMT systems.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Liu and Gildea (2008) proposed a semantic role based Tree-to-String (TTS) transducer by adding semantic roles to the TTS templates.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Their approach did not differentiate the semantic roles of different predicates, and did not always improve the TTS transducer’s performance.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Wu and Fung (2009) took the output of a phrase-based SMT system Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), and kept permuting the semantic roles of the MT output until they best matched the semantic roles in the source sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">This approach shows the positive effect of applying semantic role constraints, but it requires re-tagging semantic roles for every permuted MT output and does not scale well to longer sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">This paper explores ways of tightly integrating semantic role features (SRFs) into an MT system, rather than using them in post-processing or n- best re-ranking.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Semantic role labeling (SRL) systems usually use sentence-wide features (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al., 2004; Toutanova et al., 2005); thus it is difficult to compute target- side semantic roles incrementally during decoding.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Noticing that the source side semantic roles are easy to compute, we apply a compromise approach, where the target side semantic roles are generated by projecting the source side semantic roles using the word alignments between the source and target sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Since this approach does not perform true SRL on the target string, it cannot fully evaluate whether the source and target semantic structures are consistent.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">However, the approach does capture the semantic-level reordering of the sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">We assume here that the MT system is capable of providing word alignment (or equivalent) information during decoding, which is generally true for current statistical MT systems.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">Specifically, two types of semantic role features are proposed in this paper: a semantic role reordering feature designed to capture the skeleton- level permutation, and a semantic role deletion fea 716 Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2010), pages 716–724, Beijing, August 2010 ture designed to penalize missing semantic roles in the target sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">To use these features during decoding, we need to keep track of the semantic role sequences (SRS) for partial translations, which can be generated based on the source-side semantic role sequence and the corresponding word alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Since the SRL system and the MT system are separate, a translation rule (e.g., a phrase pair in phrase-based SMT) could cover two partial source-side semantic roles.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">In such cases partial SRSs must be recorded in such a way that they can be combined later with other partial SRSs.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Dealing with this problem will increase the complexity of the decoding algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">Fortunately, Tree-to- String transducer based MT systems (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006) can avoid this problem by using the same syntax tree for both SRL and MT. Such an arrangement guarantees that a TTS template either covers parts of one source-side semantic role, or a few complete semantic roles.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">This advantage motivates us to use a TTS transducer as the MT system with which to demonstrate the use of the proposed semantic role features.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Since it is hard to design a generative model to combine both the semantic role features and the TTS templates, we use a log-linear model to estimate the feature weights, by maximizing the conditional probabilities of the target strings given the source syntax trees.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">The log-linear model with latent variables has been discussed by Blunsom et al.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">(2008); we apply this technique to combine the TTS templates and the semantic role features.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the semantic role features proposed for machine translation; Section 3 describes how semantic role features are used and trained in a TTS transducer; Section 4 presents the experimental results; and Section 5 gives the conclusion.</S>

			<S sid ="33" ssid = "1">Translation 2.1 Defining Semantic Roles.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "2">There are two semantic standards with publicly available training data: PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and FrameNet (Johnson et al., 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "3">Prop- Bank defines a set of semantic roles for the verbs in the Penn TreeBank using numbered roles.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "4">These roles are defined individually for each verb.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "5">For example, for the verb disappoint, the role name arg1 means experiencer, but for the verb wonder, role name arg1 means cause.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "6">FrameNet is motivated by the idea that a certain type of verbs can be gathered together to form a frame, and in the same frame, a set of semantic roles is defined and shared among the verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "7">For example, the verbs boil, bake, and steam will be in frame apply heat, and they have the semantic roles of cook, food, and heating instrument.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "8">Of these two semantic standards, we choose PropBank over FrameNet for the following reasons: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "9">PropBank has a simpler semantic definition.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "10">than FrameNet and thus is easier for automatic labeling.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "11">2.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "12">PropBank is built upon the Penn TreeBank.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "13">and is more consistent with statistical parsers, most of which are trained on the Penn Tree- Bank.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "14">3.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "15">PropBank is a larger corpus than FrameNet.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "16">Note that the semantic standard/corpus is not cru cial in this paper.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "17">Any training corpus that can be used to automatically obtain the set of semantic roles of a verb could be used in our approach.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "18">2.2 Semantic Role Features.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "19">Ideally, we want to use features based on the true semantic roles of the MT candidates.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "20">Considering there is no efficient way of integrating SRL and MT, accurate target-side semantic roles can only be used in post-processing and re-ranking the MT outputs, where a limited number of MT candidates are considered.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "21">On the other hand, it is much easier to obtain reliable semantic roles for the source sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "22">This paper uses a compromise approach, where the target-side semantic roles are projected from the source-side semantic roles using the word alignment derived from the translation process.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "23">More specifically, we define two types of semantic role features: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "24">Semantic Role Reordering (SRR) This fea-.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "25">ture describes reordering of the source-side semantic roles (including the predicate) in the target side.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "26">It takes the following form: arg0 arg‐neg arg1 arg1 arg0 I did not see the book you borrowed SrcP red : SrcRole1, ..., SrcRolen ⇒ T arRole1, ..., T arRolen SRR: 没有 看见 你借的 书 where SrcP red and SrcRole denotes the central verb and semantic roles in the source side, and T arRole denotes the target-side roles.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "27">The source/target SRSs do not need be continuous, but there should be a one-to-one alignment between the roles in the two sides.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "28">Compared to the general reordering models used in statistical MT systems, this type of feature is capable of modeling skeleton-level reordering, which is crucial to the fluency of MT output.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "29">Because a predicate can have different semantic role sequences in different voices, passive/active are tagged for each occurrence of the verbs based on their POS and preceding words.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "30">Figure 1 shows examples of the feature SRR.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "31">2.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "32">Deleted Roles (DR) are the individual source-.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "33">side semantic roles which are deleted in the MT outputs, taking the form of: SrcP red : SrcRole ⇒ deleted DR is meant to penalize the deletion of the semantic roles.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "34">Though most statistical MT systems have penalties for word deletion, it is still useful to make separate features for the deletion of semantic roles, which is considered more harmful than the deletion of non-core components (e.g., modifiers) and deserves more serious penalty.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "35">Examples of the deletion features can be found in Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "36">Both types of features can be made non-lexicalized by removing the actual verb but retaining its voice information in the features.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "37">Non-lexicalized features are used in the system to alleviate the problem of sparse verbs.</S>

			<S sid ="72" ssid = "40">A Tree-to-String transducer receives a syntax tree as its input and, by recursively applying TTS templates, generates the target string.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "41">A TTS template is composed of a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand side (RHS), where the LHS is a sub- tree pattern and the RHS is a sequence of variables and translated words.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "42">The variables in the RHS of a template correspond to the bottom level non- terminals in the LHS’s subtree pattern, and their relative order indicates the permutation desired at the point where the template is applied to translate one language to another.</S>

			<S sid ="105" ssid = "26">In this formula, LC C ! is the number of role sequences obtained by first choosing i out of C possible roles and then permuting the i roles.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "27">This theoretical upper bound is not reached in practice, because the number of possible TTS templates applicable at a tree node is very limited.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "28">Furthermore, since we apply beam pruning at each tree node, the running time is controlled by the beam size, and is linear in the size of the tree.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "29">The reordering of the semantic roles from source to target is computed for each TTS template as part of the template extraction process, using the word-level alignments between the LHS/RHS of the TTS template (e.g., Figure 3).</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "30">This is usually straightforward, with the exception of the case where the words that are aligned to a particular role’s span in the source side are not continuous in the target side, as shown in Figure 4.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "31">Since we are primarily interested in the relative order of the semantic roles, we approximate each semantic role’s target side position by the median of the word positions that is aligned to.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "32">If more than one semantic role is mapped to the same position in the target side, their source side order will be used as their target side order, i.e., monotonic translation is assumed for those semantic roles.</S>

			<S sid ="115" ssid = "36">We describe two alternative methods for training the weights for the model’s features, including both the individual TTS templates and the semantic role features.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "37">The first method maximizes data likelihood as is standard in EM, while the second method maximizes conditional likelihood for a log- linear model following Blunsom et al.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "38">(2008).</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "39">3.3.1 Maximizing Data Likelihood The standard way to train a TTS translation model is to extract the minimum TTS templates using GHKM (Galley et al., 2004), and then normalize the frequency of the extracted TTS templates (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "40">The probability of the semantic features SRR and DR can be computed similarly, given that SRR and DR can be derived from the paired source/target sentences and the word alignments between them.</S>

			<S sid ="125" ssid = "46">The difficult part of the EM algorithm is the E- step, which computes the expected counts of the TTS templates and the semantic features by summing over all possible derivations of the source trees and target strings.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "47">The standard inside- outside algorithm (Graehl and Knight, 2004) can be used to compute the expected counts of the TTS templates.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "48">Similar to the modification made in the TTS decoder, we can add the target-side semantic where the features f include both the TTS templates and the semantic role features.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "49">The numerator in the formula above can be computed using the same dynamic programming algorithm used to compute the expected counts in the EM algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "50">However, the partition function (denominator) requires summing over all possible source trees and target strings, and is infeasible to compute.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "51">Instead of approximating the partition function using methods such as sampling, we change the objective function from the data likelihood to the conditional likelihood: role sequence to the dynamic programming states D exp i λi fi (S, T , D)of the inside-outside algorithm to compute the ex P r(S | T ) = P P exp P λ f (S , T , D ) pected counts of the semantic features.</S>

Given a set of TTS templates, the new partition function can be efficiently computed using the dynamic programming algorithm shown in Figure 7.</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "56">Again, to simplify the illustration, only binary TTS templates are used.</S>
			<S sid ="136" ssid = "57">Using the conditional probability as the objective function not only reduces the computational cost, but also corresponds better to the TTS decoder, where the best MT output is selected only among the possible candidates which can be generated from the input source tree using TTS templates.</S>

			<S sid ="174" ssid = "1">This paper proposes two types of semantic role features for a Tree-to-String transducer: one models the reordering of the source-side semantic role sequence, and the other penalizes the deletion of a source-side semantic role.</S>

			<S sid ="176" ssid = "3">The first and second example shows that SRFs improve the completeness and the ordering of the MT outputs respectively, the third example shows that SRFs improve both properties.</S>
			<S sid ="177" ssid = "4">The subscripts of each Chinese phrase show their aligned words in English.</S>
			<S sid ="178" ssid = "5">and the Tree-to-String templates, trained based on a conditional log-linear model, are shown to significantly improve a basic TTS transducer’s performance in terms of BLEU4.</S>
			<S sid ="179" ssid = "6">To avoid BLEU’s bias towards the adequacy of the MT outputs, manual evaluation is conducted for sentence fluency and significant improvement is shown by using the semantic role features in the log-linear model.</S>
