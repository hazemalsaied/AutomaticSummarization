		<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">This paper presents a methodology for using the argument structure of sentences as encoded by the PropBank project to develop clusters of verbs with similar meaning and usage These clusters can be favorably compared to the classes developed by the VerbNet project The most interesting cases are those where the clustering methodology suggests new members for VerbNet classes which will then be associated with the semantic predicates for that class</S>

			<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">There can be no doubt that meaning is dependent upon a great number of factors The di√Üculty in higher-level comprehension in Natural Language Processing is due to the identification of these factors as well as the successful implementation of methods for handling them Early generative models of syntax failed to answer the meaning question because of their assumption that semantics was a natural outcome of structure thus neglecting the other factors involved More recent works such as those found in WordNet (Miller 1985 Fellbaum 1998) and its descendents fall short for the inverse reason they focus solely on lexical meaning while ignoring structure altogether Another factor in the meaning game is the relationship between individual lexical items of the same function How are all determiners alike for example and how are they individually different?</S>
			<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Are there subclasses within the class of determiners and how do these subclasses differ from each other?</S>

			<S sid ="5" ssid = "1">Much previous work in the domain of classification of lexical items has focused on verbs This is a natural starting place since the verb is the hook upon which the rest of a sentence hangs Verbs also display a higher degree of variation in their semantics than other lexical types Whereas nouns for example all name some kind of thing verbs can describe an action or a state and involve some number of nonverbal actors in the description It is this latter quality of verbs which most interests us here and indeed which has been the focus of most previous work in verb classification Even the most elementary grammars of English draw a distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs More advanced work has refined this distinction into ever- larger numbers of classes For example the landmark work of Levin (1993) divided over three thousand verbs into 191 classes based partly on shared semantics and partly on shared syntactic alternations More recently the VerbNet project at Penn (Kipper et al 2000) incorporated Levin s verb classification to systematically create verb entries in a lexicon On a purely semantic note WordNet (Miller 1985 Fellbaum 1998) has classified much of the vo-.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "2">cabulary of English not just verbs in terms of relationships such as synonymy hyponymy and others Various attempts worldwide have begun focussing on the argument structure of verbs as part of developing dependency grammars The PropBank project at Penn (Kingsbury and Palmer 2002) is an example of this process for English similar projects are underway for Czech (Hajicova etc) German (Broker1998) and others The FrameNet project at Berke ley (Baker et al 1998) has classified many words in terms of their relation to a relatively small number of core semantic concepts such as commerce and judgment Various attempts have been made toautomatically cluster verbs into semantically meaningful classes using the Levin class as a gold stan dard for evaluation (Gildea 2002 McCarthy 2000 Merlo and Stevenson 2001 Schulte im Walde 2000) In the next two sections we provide background on VerbNet and PropBank which play central roles in the cluster methodology presented here 2.1 VerbNet.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "3">VerbNet is a verb lexicon with syntactic and semantic information for English verbs referring to Levin verb classes (Levin 1993) for systematic construction of lexical entries This lexicon exploits the systematic link between syntax and semantics that motivates these classes and thus provides a clear and regular association between syntactic and semantic properties of verbs and verb classes (Kipper et al 2000 Dang et al 2000) Each class in the hier-.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "4">archy is composed of a set of members (linked to their WordNet synsets) and a set of syntactic frames and semantic information for each frame Currently VerbNet has over 4 000 verb senses described (3 004 lemmas) within 191 first level classes VerbNet has a hierarchical structure with the first level classes constituted by the original Levin classes In order to ensure that each class is coherent so that all its members share a common set of thematic roles syntactic frames and semantic predicates some restructuring of the classes was required This reorganization which was facilitated by the use of inter- sective Levin classes (Dang et al 1998) refined the classes to account for semantic and syntactic differences within a class A child subclass inherits all the information from its parent class and adds information to it which can be in terms of imposing further restrictions on the roles or adding syntactic frames or semantic predicates to the subclass The hierarchical organization of VerbNet is illustrated in Figure 1 The Transfer of a Message verb class is subdivided into three levels At the top level are thematic roles syntactic frames and semantic predicates shared by all members of the class In this particular case there is a transitive frame with the Topic (message) as the direct object (Agent Verb Topic) as in &quot;John explained trigonometry&quot; and a frame for Topic and Recipient (Agent Verb Topic to the transfer of information event but in the first case the Recipient is underspecified Some of the verbs in this class are able to participate in other syntactic frames as well Verbs at the second level can take the ditransitive frame (Agent Verb Recipient Topic) in addition to the frames and predicates inherited from the parent class VerbNet uses a fiat semantic representation in which the semantics of each syntactic frame is captured by a conjunction of predicates 1 such as motion, contact, transfer info which can be negated or not These predicates can take arguments over the verb complements as well as over implicit existentially quantified event variables Each semantic predicate in VerbNet also include a time function specifying whether the predicate is true in the preparatory (during(E )) culmination (end(E )) or consequent (result(E )) stage of an event in a tripartite event structure is similar to that of Moens and Steedman (1988) which allows us to express the semantics of classes of verbs like change of state verbs whose description requires reference to a complex event structure 2.2 PropBank.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "5">In a different vein the PropBank project (Kingsbury and Palmer 2002) has endeavoured to describe all the most frequent verbs of English in terms of their argument structure This project has three major differences from previous works First the description of each verb is accompanied by a rich set of examples drawn from real language in this case the Wall Street Journal sections of the Penn Treebank (Marcus 1994) Furthermore the descriptions are based on the usages in the corpus rather than a possible situation where the corpus was mined for sentences fitting preconceived patterns This results in many instances which are perfectly well-formed but unexpected The best example of this is an odd usage of the verb add The Nasdaq composite index added 1 01 to 456 6 on pa try vo ume where the context makes it clear that add is being used as a synonym for rise Second argument structure allows for a richer set of descriptions than merely transitive unaccusative and so forth since any individual verb is allowed to have anywhere between zero and six arguments Third and perhaps most importantly the PropBank descriptions make explicit mention of the different senses of verbs This is crucial because different senses can have different argument structures or different syntactic alternations a detail which is often glossed over in other resources Thus while (1) Recipient) as in &quot;John taught math to Mary&quot; Both 1 syntactic frames have semantic predicates expressing Presently there are 64 distinct predicates described.</S>

			<S sid ="14" ssid = "2">The PropBank annotations thus provide a rich set of actual usages which are easily divided into senses and quantified That is for any verb (sense) it is possible to collect all the usages divide them into their various syntactic realizations and enumerate these realizations The realizations themselves arerendered at a very basic level encoding only the lin ear order of arguments The verb itself is rendered as re for relation Thus a verb such as repea can appear in either a simple transitive or passive ArgO West Germany] will repeal Arg1 the unpopular turnover tax on security transactions] (wsj 0302) --- Arg0 rel Arg1 the tax will be o√Ücially repealed Arg1but with different Arg0 s The annotator of this sen tence clearly forgot this specification FortunatelyPropBank is proceeding through a double blind annotation followed by an adjudication phase The ad judication will catch and correct structures such as the above For the time being however such errorsare retained largely for want of an e√Ücient and ac curate filtering mechanism Other filtering on the data is performed however Since the TreeBank corpus is subject to the same 2 *traceÔøΩthe tax*] before the end of the Zipfian distributionof lexical items as any natural current parliamentary term (wsj 0302) --- rel Arg1 As seen in the second example adjuncts such as the temporal before the end of the current par iamentary term are omitted While the bulk of annotations fall into basic categories such as Arg0 rel Arg1 (basic transitive) Arg0 rel Arg1 Arg2 (ditransitive) and so forth the nature of the data and the annotation process itself means that there is a large residue of irregular syntactic realizations As an example of the former consider the following sentence where the benefactive argument has been topicalized to the beginning For Arg4 Mr Sherwin] ArgO a conviction] could carry Arg1 penalties of five years in prison and a $250 000 fine on each count] (wsj 1331) --- Arg4 Arg0 rel Arg1 Such a construction is certainly a natural part of English yet it occurs very rarely-only twice in all of Propbank (so far) The annotation process itself also introduces many odd low-frequency syntactic realizations which should be regarded as errors For example occasionally annotators include one argument label twice the board also was informed of Arg1 interest] expressed by ArgO buyout funds including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co and Forstmann Little &amp; Co ] as well as by ArgO Robert Bass Morgan Stanley s buyout fund and Pan Am Corp] (wsj 2104) --- Arg1 rel Arg0 Arg0 In cases of such conjoined constructions the annotation guidelines specify that the sentence should be regarded as two overlapping sentences with two overlapping argument structures Thus for the sentence above there should properly be two instances of Arg1 rel Arg0 each with the same Arg1 and rellanguage database many verbs are only poorly at tested A largely arbitrary decision was made toeliminate all verbs which had fewer than 10 attesta tions Finally again due to the ongoing nature of the PropBank work not all polysemous verbs have been disambiguated These verbs were also deleted from the subsequent analysis All the same the resulting dataset provides 921 verbs with 200 distinct syntactic realizations of varying frequencies Each realizationwas recorded as a proportion of the number of attestations of that syntactic pattern to the total num ber of attestations of that verb Expressing these asproportions rather than as raw counts allows for bet ter comparisons among verbs which themselves vary widely in frequency The proportions themselves arethen run through a standard clustering algorithm im plemented in R (http jjwww R-project org) whichclassifies each verb by the difference between its at tested proportions and the proportions attested byevery other verb Verbs with little difference mean ing they attest nearly the same syntactic patterns in nearly the same proportions are judged to be very similar and are likely to be grouped into the sameclass A varying number of &quot;centroids&quot; or proto types for each class can be established Each verb is then classified by its similarity to the centroidsresulting in a number of classes equal to the num ber of centroids The resulting classes are compared to the existing VerbNet classes This is at best anoisy measure of accuracy since many of the Prop Banked verbs (even fairly richly-attested ones) are not classified in VerbNet and many verbs which are classified in VerbNet are not present in PropBank in su√Ücient numbers to undergo the clustering analysis These factors are constant across all possible number of centroidsjclasses however so at least the amount of noise in the assessment remains constant as well The probability of occurrence of words or other items starts high and tapers off.</S>

			<S sid ="16" ssid = "1">As an initial assessment of the worth of the methodology consider the case with only three clusters The clusters can be viewed graphically in Figure 2 The crosses are the centroids Such a display as this is naturally a gross simplification of the actual 200-dimensional space the clusters are mapped in but it s the best that can be done on paper If we look at (a sample of ) the membership of each of the three clusters we see that the three groups clearly fall into the sets of transitive unaccusative and ditransitive verbs 3 For higher numbers of clusters a more formal method of measuring accuracy is required Since we are comparing sets the similarity of two sets A and B can be computed with the following IAnBI similarity(A, B)ÔøΩ IAUBI In other words the similarity of two sets can be measured as the number of elements shared by the two sets divided by the total number of unique elements in the two sets Thus two identical setsetc) This demonstrates how a three-cluster analy sis while interesting for describing a gross syntacticgrouping does not go very far in describing any finer grained meaning contrasts To get at the classification with real implications for meaning we clearly need to use more smaller clusters How many more and how small?</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "2">Since the original set of verbs under analysis comes from 150 VerbNet classes we can set an upper bound on the number of clusters at 150 Then we iteratively derive clusters for each number between 3 and 150 and find the similarity scores for each cluster in each of those sets To facilitate comparison between the various sets of clusters we calculate the average similarity across all the classes This is necessary because as the number of clusters rises the size of any individual cluster is likely to fall thus bringing the denominator of the similarity equation down Taken across all the clusters then the similarity scores are bound to rise regardless of improvements in the matching between the VerbNet clusters and the automatically-derived ones The outcome of this procedure can be seen in Figure 3 Interesting peaks appear for analyses with 14 clusters and around 89 clusters before the long tailing off with more than 90 clusters In addition there is a local maximum around 32 clusters The analyses with 14 clusters still uses very large clusters (average of 65 verbsjcluster) so that number is less useful The smallest cluster developed therein however con 4 ({a b} {b a}) would have a similarity score of 1 sists only of remain and stay 01 and that cluster because the intersection contains two elements as does the union Two sets a b and a b z wouldhave a very low similarity score since the intersec tion contains two elements but that is divided by the union with 26 elements Thus the similarity score is dependent both on the number of matches andthe number of spurious elements present For exam ple the three clusters described above most closely align to the VerbNet classes 13 5 1 (Get class) 45 6 ( a ibratab e change state class) and 48 1 1 ((ppearc ass) respectively with 4 4 and 7 matching ele ments Each of these clusters is huge however (521 335 and 65 verbs respectively) and the target sets are also large as VerbNet clusters go (31 23 and 27 verbs respectively) These factors conspire to make the overall similarity scores quite low (4j(521+31) 3 correctly maps to VerbNet class 47 11 (Exist class) which contains verbs of staying in place By the time around 90 clusters are used the derived classes themselves tend to be very small with 34 clusters containing two or fewer verbs In contrast a few clusters continue to have very large membership such as two groups (arbitrarily labeled 3 and 38 ) which contain 145 and 146 verbs respectively and which correspond roughly to VerbNet classes 29 5 ( onjecture class) and 29 2 ( haracteri e class) While 29 2 is one of the largest classes in VerbNet precisely why this class should seem to attract vagrant verbs remains to be seen More interesting however are the times when the clustering process establishes multiple clusters which are all identified with the same VerbNet class - in effect suggesting subclasses where they have not previously appeared ask.On: ask a question, as opposed to ask a favor; feel.On: feel emotion; make.O5: make money, as in &quot;Paul doesn&apos;t make nearly enough money; triple: while in most English this would be considered a transitive verb, the common usage in the Wall Street Journal is actually un This trend appears even with fairly low numbers of clusters and it tends to be extremely consistent as to which VerbNet clusters are split For example class45 4 (Other change state) containing the miscella acusative, as in &quot;Paul&apos;s net worth tripled when he found 4 a $5 bill in the dryer&apos;.&quot; Sense:remain.</S>

			<S sid ="19" ssid = "1">Clustering of syntactic patterns can quickly and automatically provide a first approximation of the groupings into which meaning-bearing items fall The methodology easily captures low-level generalizations and points out shortcomings in the gold standard verb classification against which it was judged Nevertheless it is only a first pass at transforming syntactic structure into semantics Additional information is available to extend the paradigm For example the syntactic patterns which were the subject of the clustering algorithm were nothing more than the linear order of the arguments of the verb Further refinement on the syntactic structure would be possible at the expense of multiplying the patterns For instance in the preceding all prepositions were stripped from the argument structure even though PropBank includes the preposition as part of the argument label rather than as part of the argument itself Also it would be possible to label the arguments with thematic roles instead of the generic labels used by PropBank when possible thus providing a measure of semantics mixed in with the syntax Kipper et al (submitted 2003) describes the process of mapping PropBank argument labels onto VerbNet thematic roles Cur rently over 64% of the PropBank argument labelshave been mapped automatically and that is with out recourse to the sense-disambiguated data Thissuggests that the two resources are highly compati ble and that the combined data could easily be used in the clustering methodology A larger measure ofmeaning could be added if some notion of the mean ing of the verbs could be included in the clusteringas well For example WordNet synonym sets espe cially as encoded in VerbNet could be used as theinitial state of the clusters which then could be mod ified by the disjsimilarity of the syntactic patternsattested by those verbs Such refinements to the pro cess would in themselves be steps towards integratingthe many factors that contribute to the understand ing of meaning</S>
