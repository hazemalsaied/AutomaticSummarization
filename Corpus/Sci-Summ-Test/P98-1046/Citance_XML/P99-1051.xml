			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Diathesis alternations are changes in the realization of the argument structure of a verb that are some­ times accompanied by changes in meaning (Levin, 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">The phenomenon in English is illustrated in (I)-(2) below.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">The objective of this paper is to investigate the ex­ tent to which diathesis alternations are empirically attested in corpus data.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Using the dative and bene­ factive alternations as a test case we attempt to de­ termine: (a) if some alternations are more frequent than others, (b) if alternating verbs have frame pref­ erences and (c) what the representative members of an alternation are.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">In section 2 we describe and evaluate the set of automatic methods we used to acquire verbs under­ going the dative and benefactive alternations.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">We assess the acquired frames using a filtering method presented in section 3.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">The results are detailed in section 4.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Sections 5 and 6 discuss how the derived type and token frequencies can be used to estimate how productive an alternation is for a given verb se­ mantic class and how typical its members are.</S>

			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">The benefactive alterna­ tion (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">(2)) is structurally similar to the dative, the difference being that it involves the preposition for rather than to.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Levin (1993) assumes that the syntactic realiza­ tion of a verb&apos;s arguments is directly correlated with its meaning (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">also Pinker (1989) for a similar pro­ posal).</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Thus one would expect verbs that undergo the same alternations to form a semantically co­ herent class.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">Levin&apos;s study on diathesis alternations has influenced recent work on word sense disam­ biguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996), machine transla­ tion (Dang et al., 1998), and automatic lexical ac­ quisition (McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Schulte im Walde, 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">The part-of-speech tagged version of the British Na­ tional Corpus (BNC), a 100 million word collec­ tion of written and spoken British English (Burnard, 1995), was used to acquire the frames characteris­ tic of the dative and benefactive alternations.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Sur­ face syntactic structure was identified using Gsearch (Keller et al., 1999), a tool which allows the search of arbitrary POS-tagged corpora for shallow syntac­ tic patterns based on a user-specified context-free grammar and a syntactic query.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">It achieves this by combining a left-comer parser with a regular ex­ pression matcher.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Depending on the grammar specification (i.e., re­ cursive or not) Gsearch can be used as a full context­ free parser or a chunk parser.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">Depending on the syn­ tactic query, Gsearch can parse full sentences, iden­ tify syntactic relations (e.g., verb-object, adjective­ noun) or even single words (e.g., all indefinite pro nouns in the corpus).</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">Gsearch outputs all corpus sentences containing substrings that match a given syntactic query.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Given two possible parses that begin at the same point in the sentence, the parser chooses the longest match.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">If there are two possible parses that can be produced for the same substring, only one parse is returned.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">This means that if the number of ambiguous rules in the grammar is large, the correctness of the parsed output is not guaranteed.</S>
			<SUBSECTION>2.2 Acquisition.</SUBSECTION>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">We used Gsearch to extract tokens matching the patterns &apos;V NPl NP2&apos;, &apos;VP NPl to NP2&apos;, and &apos;V NPl for NP2&apos; by specifying a chunk grammar for recognizing the verbal complex and NPs.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">POS-tags were retained in the parser&apos;s output which was post­ processed to remove adverbials and interjections.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">Examples of the parser&apos;s output are given in (3).</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">Although there are cases where Gsearch produces the right parse (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">(3a)), the parser wrongly iden­ tifies as instances of the double object frame to­ kens containing compounds (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">(3b)), bare relative clauses (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">(3c)) and NPs in apposition (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">(3d)).</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "40">Sometimes the parser attaches prepositional phrases to the wrong site (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "41">(3e)) and cannot distinguish between arguments and adjuncts (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "42">(3f)) or be­ tween different types of adjuncts (e.g., temporal (cf.</S>

			<S sid ="108" ssid = "43">In order to consider verbs with prepositional frames as candidates for the dative and benefactive alterna­ tions the following requirements needed to be met: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "44">the PP must be attached to the verb; 3Throught the paper the reported percentages are the aver­ age of the judges&apos; individual classifications.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "45">2.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "46">in the case ofthe &apos;V NP1 to NP2&apos; structure, the to-PP must be an argument of the verb; 3.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "47">in the case of the &apos;V NP1 for NP2&apos; structure, the for-PP must be benefactive.4 In order to meet requirements (1)-(3), we first de­ termined the attachment site (e.g., verb or noun) of the PP and secondly developed a procedure for dis­ tinguishing benefactive from non-benefactive PPs.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "48">Several approaches have statistically addressed the problem of prepositional phrase ambiguity, with comparable results (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Collins and Brooks, 1995; Ratnaparkhi, 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "49">Hin­ dle and Rooth (1993) used a partial parser to extract ( v, n, p) tuples from a corpus, where p is the prepo­ sition whose attachment is ambiguous between the verb v and the noun n. We used a variant of the method described in Hindle and Rooth (1993), the main difference being that we applied their lexical association score (a log-likelihood ratio which com­ pares the probability of noun versus verb attach­ ment) in an unsupervised non-iterative manner.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "50">Fur­ thermore, the procedure was applied to the special case of tuples containing the prepositions to and for only.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "51">2.4.1 Evaluation We evaluated the procedure by randomly select­ ing 2,124 tokens containing to-PPs and for-PPs for which the procedure guessed verb or noun at­ tachment.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "52">The tokens were disambiguated by two judges.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "53">Precision figures are reported in table 3.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "54">The lexical association score was highly accu­ rate on guessing both verb and noun attachment for to-PPs.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "55">Further evaluation revealed that for 98.6% (K = 0.9, N = 494, k = 2) of the tokens clas­ sified as instances of verb attachment, the to-PP was an argument of the verb, which meant that the log-likelihood ratio satisfied both requirements (1) and (2) for to-PPs.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "56">A low precision of 36% was achieved in detecting instances of noun attachment for for-PPs.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "57">One rea­ son for this is the polysemy of the preposition for: for-PPs can be temporal, purposive, benefactive or causal adjuncts and consequently can attach to var­ ious sites.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "58">Another difficulty is that benefactive for­ PPs semantically license both attachment sites.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "59">To further analyze the poor performance of thelog-likelihood ratio on this task, 500 tokens con 4 Syntactically speaking, benefactive for-PPs are not argu­ ments but adjuncts (Jackendoff, 1990) and can appear on any verb with which they are semantically compatible.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "60">tammg for-PPs were randomly selected from the parser&apos;s output and disambiguated.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "61">Of these 73.9% (K = 0.9, N = 500, k = 2) were instances of verb attachment, which indicates that verb attachments outnumber noun attachments for for-PPs, and there­ fore a higher precision for verb attachment (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "62">re­ quirement (1)) can be achieved without applying the log-likelihood ratio, but instead classifying all in­ stances as verb attachment.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "63">2.5 Benefactive PPs.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "64">Although surface syntactic cues can be important for determining the attachment site of prepositional phrases, they provide no indication of the semantic role of the preposition in question.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "65">This is particu­ larly the case for the preposition for which can have several roles, besides the benefactive.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "66">Two judges discriminated benefactive from non­ benefactive PPs for 500 tokens, randomly selected from the parser&apos;s output.</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "67">Only 18.5% (K = 0.73, N = 500, k = 2) of the sample contained bene­ factive PPs.</S>
			<S sid ="133" ssid = "68">An analysis of the nouns headed by the preposition for revealed that 59.6% were animate, 17% were collective, 4.9% denoted locations, and the remaining 18.5% denoted events, artifacts, body parts,&apos; or actions.</S>
			<S sid ="134" ssid = "69">Animate, collective and location nouns account for 81.5% of the benefactive data.</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "70">We used the WordNet taxonomy (Miller et al., 1990) to recognize benefactive PPs (cf.</S>

			<S sid ="161" ssid = "7">Of these, 10 correctly alternate (cause, deliver, hand, refuse, report and set for the dative alternation and cause, spoil, afford and prescribe for the benefactive), and 12 can appear in either frame but do not alter­ nate (e.g., appoint, fix, proclaim).</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "8">For 18 verbs two frames were acquired but only one was correct (e.g., swap and forgive which take only the double object frame), and finally 12 verbs neither alternated nor had the acquired frames.</S>

			<S sid ="220" ssid = "66">6 Typicality.</S>
			<S sid ="221" ssid = "67">Estimating the productivity of an alternation for a given class does not incorporate information about the frequency of the verbs undergoing the alterna­ tion.</S>
			<S sid ="222" ssid = "68">We propose to use frequency data to quantify the typicality of a verb or verb class for a given alter­ nation.</S>
			<S sid ="223" ssid = "69">The underlying assumption is that a verb is typical for an alternation if it is equally frequent for both frames which are characteristic for the alter­ nation.</S>
			<S sid ="224" ssid = "70">Thus the typicality of a verb can be defined as the conditional probability of the frame given the verb: f(framei, verb) (6) P(framedverb) = &quot; L f(framen, verb) n We calculate P(framedverb) by dividing f(framei, verb), the number of times the verb was attested in the corpus with frame i, by f(frame,&quot; verb), the overall number of times the verb was attested.</S>
			<S sid ="225" ssid = "71">In our case a verb has two frames, hence P(framedverb) is close to 0.5 for typical verbs (i.e., verbs with balanced frequencies) and close to either 0 or 1 for peripheral verbs, depending on their preferred frame.</S>
			<S sid ="226" ssid = "72">Consider the verb owe as an example (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="227" ssid = "73">figure 1).</S>
			<S sid ="228" ssid = "74">648 instances of owe were found, of which 309 were instances of the double object frame.</S>
			<S sid ="229" ssid = "75">By dividing the latter by the former we can see that owe is highly typical of the dative alternation: its typicality score for the double object frame is 0.48.</S>
			<S sid ="230" ssid = "76">By taking the average of P(framei, verb) for all verbs which undergo the alternation and belong to the same semantic class, we can estimate how typi­ cal this class is for the alternation.</S>
			<S sid ="231" ssid = "77">Table 6 illustrates the typicality (Typ) of the semantic classes for the two alternations.</S>
			<S sid ="232" ssid = "78">(The typicality values were com­ puted for the double object frame).</S>
			<S sid ="233" ssid = "79">For the dative alternation, the most typical class is GIVE, and the most peripheral is DRIVE (e.g., ferry).</S>
			<S sid ="234" ssid = "80">For the bene­ factive alternation, PERFORMANCE (e.g., sing), PREPARE (e.g., bake) and GET (e.g., buy) verbs are the most typical, whereas CREATE verbs (e.g., com­ pose) are peripheral, which seems intuitively cor­ rect.</S>
			<S sid ="235" ssid = "81">7 Future Work.</S>
			<S sid ="236" ssid = "82">The work reported in this paper relies on frame frequencies acquired from corpora using partial­ parsing methods.</S>
			<S sid ="237" ssid = "83">For instance, frame frequency data was used to estimate whether alternating verbs ex­ hibit different preferences for a given frame (typi­ cality).</S>
			<S sid ="238" ssid = "84">However, it has been shown that corpus id­ iosyncrasies can affect subcategorization frequen­ cies (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="239" ssid = "85">Roland and Jurafsky (1998) for an exten­ sive discussion).</S>
			<S sid ="240" ssid = "86">This suggests that different corpora may give different results with respect to verb al­ ternations.</S>
			<S sid ="241" ssid = "87">For instance, the to-PP frame is poorly&apos; represented in the syntactically annotated version of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="242" ssid = "88">There are only 26 verbs taking the to-PP frame, of which 20 have frame frequency of 1.</S>
			<S sid ="243" ssid = "89">This indicates that a very small number of verbs undergoing the dative alter­ nation can be potentially acquired from this corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="244" ssid = "90">In future work we plan to investigate the degree to which corpus differences affect the productivity and typicality estimates for verb alternations.</S>
			<S sid ="245" ssid = "91">8 Conclusions.</S>
			<S sid ="246" ssid = "92">This paper explored the degree to which diathesis alternations can be identified in corpus data via shal­ low syntactic processing.</S>
			<S sid ="247" ssid = "93">Alternating verbs were ac­ quired from the BNC by using Gsearch as a chunk parser.</S>
			<S sid ="248" ssid = "94">Erroneous frames were discarded by apply­ ing linguistic heuristics, statistical scores (the log­ likelihood ratio) and large-scale lexical resources (e.g., WordNet).</S>
			<S sid ="249" ssid = "95">We have shown that corpus frequencies can be used to quantify linguistic intuitions and lexical generalizations such as Levin&apos;s (1993) semantic classification.</S>
			<S sid ="250" ssid = "96">Furthermore, corpus frequencies can make explicit predictions about word use.</S>
			<S sid ="251" ssid = "97">This was demonstrated by using the frequencies to estimate the productivity of an alternation for a given seman­ tic class and the typicality of its members.</S>
