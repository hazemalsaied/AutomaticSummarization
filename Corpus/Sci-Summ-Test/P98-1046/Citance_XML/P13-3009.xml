			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Communication in natural language is simple.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Looking at the ease to learn and communicate in and across natural languages, the claim of existence of interlingual conceptual base (Schank, 1972) seems plausible . Conceptual Dependency (CD) theory tried to represent a conceptual base using a small set of meaning primitives.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">To achieve this goal, they put forward a proposal consisting of a small set of 12 primitive actions, a set of dependencies which connects the primitive actions with each other and with their actors, objects, instruments, etc. Their claim was that this small set of representational elements could be used to produce a canonical form for sentences in English as well as other natural languages.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Representational theories like Scripts, Plans, Goals and Understanding(SPGU) representations (Schank and Abelson, 1977) were developed from the CD theory.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">None of the descendant theories of CD could focus on the notion of &apos;primitives&apos; and the idea faded in the subsequent works.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Identification of meaning primitives is an area intensely explored and a vast number of theories have been put forward, namely, (PRO: Conceptual semantics (Jackendoff, 1976), Meaning-text theory (Mel’čuk,1981), Semantic Primes (Wierzbicka, 1996), Conceptual dependency theory (Schank, 1972) Preference Semantics (Wilks, 1975) CONTRA: Language of Thought (Fodor, 1975)).</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Through our work, we put forward a set of seven meaning primitives and claim that the permutation/combination of these seven meaning primitives along with ontological attributes is sufficient to develop a computational model for meaning representation across languages.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">This paper looks at the Conceptual Dependency Theory created by Roger Schank (Schank, 1973; Schank, 1975) and compares it with theories in Indian grammatical tradition.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">We discuss these in section 2 and section 3.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">We then analyze if we can modify Schank&apos;s approach to define a more efficient set of primitives.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">We conclude by introducing the small set of meaning primitives which we have found to cover all verbs in Indian languages like Sanskrit, Hindi and almost all verbs in English.</S>

			<S sid ="22" ssid = "5">According to the theory, during communication, to-and-fro mapping happens between linguistic structures and the conceptual base through concepts.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "6">It is due to the existence of this conceptual base and concept based mapping that a person, who is multilingual, is able to switch between languages easily.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "7">The conceptual base consists of concepts and the relations between concepts.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "8">Therefore, it is responsible for formally representing the concepts underlying an utterance.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "9">There are three types of concepts: a) nominal; b) action and c) modifier.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "10">We will concentrate only on &apos;action&apos; since our work is related to verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "11">CD’s basic premise is that the ACTION is the basis of any proposition that is not descriptive of a static piece of the world.</S>

			<S sid ="32" ssid = "15">According to Nirukta verse 1.1 (Sarup, 1920) the characteristic that defines a verb form is its verb having bhāva as its principal meaning.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "16">In Sanskrit, bhāva is a morphological form of bhavati and bhavati means &apos;happening&apos;.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "17">So structure of bhāva can be defined as structure of happening which is explained in section 4.1.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "18">According to sage Vārsyāyaṇi, Nirukta verse 1.2 (Sarup, 1920), there are 6 variants of bhāva or verb which, we believe, can be compared to 6 fundamental processes.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "19">That is, a process &apos;verb&apos; consists of six stages.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "20">They are: coming into being - jāyate &apos;is born, comes into being&apos; existing - asti &apos;is&apos; changing - vipariṇamate &apos;undergoes modification&apos; increasing - vardhate &apos;grows, increases&apos; diminishing - apaksÍ yate &apos;diminishes&apos; 12 primitive ACTs out of which the meaning of verbs, abstract and complex nouns are constructed.</S>

			<S sid ="40" ssid = "23">In CD, primitives were arrived at by noticing structural similarities that existed when sentences were put into an actor-action-object framework.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "24">Using these acts, set of states and set of conceptual roles, it is possible to express a large amount of the meanings expressible in a natural language.</S>

			<S sid ="152" ssid = "15">The annotation of verbs was done for four languages: Sanskrit, English, Hindi and Telugu.</S>
			<S sid ="153" ssid = "16">Verbs in Sanskrit and English were compiled and annotated by one trained annotator and crosschecked by an equally trained second annotator.</S>
			<S sid ="154" ssid = "17">The differences in annotation, around 10%, were resolved by discussion.</S>
			<S sid ="155" ssid = "18">Annotation in Hindi and Telugu was done by 9 and 25 annotators respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="156" ssid = "19">The annotators were humans and native speakers of their languages, having an idea of the new approach.</S>
			<S sid ="157" ssid = "20">The average ratio of correctness was 64%.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "21">The classification was done manually.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "22">Based on this classification the verb groups formed have exhibited similarity in syntactic and semantic behavior.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "23">The pattern of Stanford dependency relations formed among verbs of same groups showed a similarity of 60%.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "24">This similarity in relations were used to form WSD rules which helped in increasing the accuracy of English to Hindi Anusaaraka8 Machine Translation system output by 36.04%.</S>
