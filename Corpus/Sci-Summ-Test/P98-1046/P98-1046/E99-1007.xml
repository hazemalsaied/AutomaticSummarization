			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Recent years have witnessed a shift in grammar development methodology, from crafting large grammars, to annotation of corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Correspond­ ingly, there has been a change from developing rule-based parsers to developing statistical meth­ ods for inducing grammatical knowledge from an­ notated corpus data.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">The shift has mostly oc­ curred because building wide-coverage grammars is time-consuming, error prone, and difficult.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">The same can be said for crafting the rich lexical rep­ resentations that are a central component of lin­ guistic knowledge, and research in automatic lex­ ical acquisition has sought to address this ((Dorr and Jones, 1996; Dorr, 1997), among others).</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Yet there have been few attempts to learn fine­ grained lexical classifications from the statisti­ cal analysis of distributional data, analogously to the induction of syntactic knowledge (though see, e.g., (Brent, 1993; Klavans and Chodorow, 1992; Resnik, 1992)).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">In this paper, we propose such an approach for the automatic classification of verbs into lexical semantic classes.1 We can express the issues raised by this ap­ proach as follows.</S>

			<S sid ="14" ssid = "1">distinguish the verb classes?</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "2">In exploring these questions, we focus on verb classification for several reasons.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "3">Verbs are very important sources of knowledge in many language engineering tasks, and the relationships among verbs appear to play a major role in the orga­ nization and use of this knowledge: Knowledge about verb classes is crucial for lexical acquisition in support of language generation and machine translation (Dorr, 1997), and document classifica­ tion (Klavans and Kan, 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "4">Manual classifica­ tion of large numbers of verbs is a difficult and resource intensive task (Levin, 1993; Miller et a!., 1990; Dang eta!., 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "5">To address these issues, we suggest that one can automatically classify verbs by using statistical approximations to verb diatheses, to train an au­ tomatic classifier.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "6">We use verb diatheses, follow­ ing Levin and Dorr, for two reasons.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "7">First, verb diatheses are syntactic cues to semantic classes, 1 We are aware that a distributional approach rests on one strong assumption on the nature of the rep­ resentations under study: semantic notions and syn­ tactic notions are correlated, at least in part.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "8">This assumption is not uncontroversial (Briscoe and Copes­ take, 1995; Levin, 1993; Dorr and Jones, 1996; Dorr, 1997).</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "9">We adopt it here as a working hypothesis with­ out further discussion.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "10">hence they can be more easily captured by corpus­ based techniques.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "11">Second, using verb diatheses re­ duces noise.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "12">There is a certain consensus (Briscoe and Copestake, 1995; Pustejovsky, 1995; Palmer, 1999) that verb diatheses are regular sense exten­ sions.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "13">Hence focussing on this type of classifica­ tion allows one to abstract from the problem of word sense disambiguation and treat residual dif­ ferences in word senses as noise in the classifica­ tion task.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "14">We present an in-depth case study, in which we apply machine learning techniques to automati­ cally classify a set of verbs based on distribu­ tions of grammatical indicators of diatheses, ex­ tracted from a very large corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "15">We look at three very interesting classes of verbs: unergatives, un­ accusatives, and object-drop verbs (Levin, 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "16">These are interesting classes because they all par­ ticipate in the transitivity alternation, and they are minimal pairs - that is, a small number of well-defined distinctions differentiate their transi­ tive/intransitive behavior.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "17">Thus, we expect the differences in their distributions to be small, en­ tailing a fine-grained discrimination task that pro­ vides a challenging testbed for automatic classifi­ cation.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "18">The specific theoretical question we investigate is whether the factors underlying the verb class distinctions are reflected in the statistical distri­ butions of lexical features related to diatheses pre­ sented by the individual verbs in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "19">In doing this, we address the questions above by de­ termining what are the lexical features that could distinguish the behavior of the classes of verbs with respect to the relevant diatheses, which of those features can be gleaned from the corpus, and which of those, once the statistical distribu­ tions are available, can be used successfully by an automatic classifier.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "20">We follow a computational experimental methodology by investigating as indicated each of the hypotheses below: Hl: Linguistically and psychologically motivated features for distinguishing the verb classes are ap­ parent within linguistic experience.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "21">We analyze the three classes based on prop­ erties of the verbs that have been shown to be relevant for linguistic classification (Levin 93), or for disambiguation in syntactic pro­ cessing (MacDonald94, Trueswell96) to deter­ mine potentially relevant distinctive features.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "22">We then count those features (or approxima­ tions to them) in a very large corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "23">H2: The distributional patterns of (some of) those features contribute to learning the classifications of the verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "24">We apply machine learning techniques to de­ termine whether the features support the learning of the classifications.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "25">H3: Non-overlapping features are the most effec­ tive in learning the classifications of the verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "26">We analyze the contribution of different fea­ tures to the classification process.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "27">To preview, we find that, related to (H1), lin­ guistically motivated features (related to diathe­ ses) that distinguish the verb classes can be ex­ tracted from an annotated, and in one case parsed, corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "28">In relation to (H2), a subset of these features is sufficient to halve the error rate com­ pared to chance in automatic verb classification, suggesting that distributional data provides use­ ful knowledge to the classification of verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "29">Fur­ thermore, in relation to (H3) we find that features that are distributionally predictable, because they are highly correlated to other features, contribute little to classification performance.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "30">We conclude that the usefulness of distributional features to the learner is determined by their informativeness.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "31">2 Determining the Features.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "32">In this section, we present motivation for the fea­ tures that we investigate in terms of their role in learning the verb classes.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "33">We first present the lin­ guistically derived features, then turn to evidence from experimental psycholinguistics to extend the set of potentially relevant features.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "34">2.1 Features of the Verb Classes.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "35">The three verb classes under investigation - unergatives, unaccusatives, and object-drop- dif­ fer in the properties of their transitive/intransitive alternations, which are exemplified below.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "36">Unergative: (1a) The horse raced past the barn.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "37">(1b) The jockey raced the horse past the barn.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "38">Unaccusative: (2a) The butter melted in the pan.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "39">(2b) The cook melted the butter in the pan.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "40">Object-drop: (3a) The boy washed the hall.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "41">(3b) The boy washed.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "42">The sentences in (1) use an unergative verb, raced.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "43">Unergatives are intransitive action verbs whose transitive form is the causativecounterpart of the intransitive form.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "44">Thus, the subject of the in­ transitive (la) becomes the object of the transi­ tive (lb) (Brousseau and Ritter, 1991; Hale and Keyser, 1993; Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 1995).</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "45">The sentences in (2) use an unaccusative verb, melted.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "46">Unaccusatives are intransitive change of state verbs (2a); like unergatives, the transitive counterpart for these verbs is also causative (2b).</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "47">The sentences in (3) use an object-drop verb, washed; these verbs have a non-causative transi­ tive/intransitive alternation, in which the object is simply optional.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "48">Both unergatives and unaccusatives have a causative transitive form, but differ in the seman­ tic roles that they assign to the participants in the event described.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "49">In an intransitive unergative, the subject is an Agent (the doer of the event), and in an intransitive unaccusative, the subject is a Theme (something affected by the event).</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "50">The role assignments to the corresponding semantic arguments of the transitive forms-i.e., the di­ rect objects-are the same, with the addition of a Causal Agent (the causer of the event) as subject in both cases.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "51">Object-drop verbs simply assign Agent to the subject and Theme to the optional object.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "52">We expect the differing semantic role assign­ ments of the verb classes to be reflected in their syntactic behavior, and consequently in the distri­ butional data we collect from a corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "53">The three classes can be characterized by their occurrence in two alternations: the transitive/intransitive al­ ternation and the causative alternation.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "54">Unerga­ tives are distinguished from the other classes in being rare in the transitive form (see (Steven­ son and Merlo, 1997) for an explanation of this fact).</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "55">Both unergatives and unaccusatives are dis­ tinguished from object-drop in being causative in their transitive form, and similarly we expect this to be reflected in amount of detectable causative use.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "56">Furthermore, since the causative is a transi­ tive use, and the transitive use of unergatives is expected to be rare, causativity should primar­ ily distinguish unaccusatives from object-drops.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "57">In conclusion, we expect the defining features of the verb classes-the intransitive/transitive and causative alternations-to lead to distributional differences in the observed usages of the verbs in these alternations.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "58">2.2 Features of the MV /RR Alternatives.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "59">Not only do the verbs under study differ in their thematic properties, they also differ in their pro­ cessing properties.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "60">Because these verbs can occur both in a transitive and an intransitive form, they have been particularly studied in the context of the main verb/reduced relative (MV /RR) ambi­ guity illustrated below (Bever, 1970): The horse raced past the barn fell.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "61">The verb raced can be interpreted as either a past tense main verb, or as a past participle within a reduced relative clause (i.e., the horse (that was] raced past the barn).</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "62">Because fell is the main verb, the reduced relative interpretation of raced is re­ quired for a coherent analysis of the complete sen­ tence.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "63">But the main verb interpretation of raced is so strongly preferred that people experience great difficulty at the verb fell, unable to integrate it with the interpretation that has been developed to that point.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "64">However, the reduced relative in­ terpretation is not difficult for all verbs, as in the following example: The boy washed in the tub was angry.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "65">The difference in ease of interpreting the resolu­ tions of this ambiguity has been shown to be sen­ sitive to both frequency differentials (MacDonald, 1994; Trueswell, 1996) and to verb class distinc­ tions (?).</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "66">Consider the features that distinguish the two resolutions of the MV/RR ambiguity: Main Verb: The horse raced past the barn quickly.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "67">Reduced Relative: The horse raced past the barn fell.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "68">In the main verb resolution, the ambiguous verb raced is used in its intransitive form, while in the reduced relative, it is used in its transitive, causative form.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "69">These features correspond di­ rectly to the defining alternations of the three verb classes under study (intransitive/transitive, causative).</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "70">Additionally, we see that other re­ lated features to these usages serve to distinguish the two resolutions of the ambiguity.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "71">The main verb form is active and a main verb part-of-speech (labeled as VBD by automatic POS taggers); by contrast, the reduced relative form is passive and a past participle (tagged as VBN).</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "72">Although these properties are redundant with the intran­ sitive/transitive distinction, recent work in ma­ chine learning (Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Ratnaparkhi, 1998) has shown that using overlapping features can be beneficial for learning in a maximum en­ tropy framework, and we want to explore it in this setting to test H3 above.2 In the next section, 2 These properties are redundant with the intran­ sitive/transitive distinction, as passive implies tran­ sitive use, and necessarily entails the use of a past participle.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "73">We performed a correlation analysis that we describe how we compile the corpus counts for each of the four properties, in order to approxi­ mate the distributional information of these alter­ nations.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "74">3 Frequency Distributions of the.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "75">Features We assume that currently available large cor­ pora are a reasonable approximation to lan­ guage (Pullum, 1996).</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "76">Using a combined cor­ pus of 65-million words, we measured the rel­ ative frequency distributions of the linguistic features (VBD /VBN, active/passive, intransi­ tive/transitive, causative/non-causative) over a sample of verbs from the three lexical semantic classes.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "77">3.1 Materials.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "78">We chose a set of 20 verbs from each class - di­ vided into two groups each, as will be explained below - based primarily on the classification of verbs in (Levin, 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "79">The unergatives are manner of motion verbs: jumped, rushed, marched, leaped, floated, raced, hurried, wandered, vaulted, paraded (group 1); galloped, glided, hiked, hopped, jogged, scooted, scurried, skipped, tiptoed, trotted (group 2).</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "80">The unaccusatives are verbs of change of state: opened, exploded, flooded, dissolved, cracked, hardened, boiled, melted, fractured, solidified (group 1); collapsed, cooled, folded, widened, changed, cleared, divided, simmered, stabilized (group 2).</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "81">The object-drop verbs are unspecified object al­ ternation verbs: played, painted, kicked, carved, reaped, washed, danced, yelled, typed, knitted (group 1); borrowed, inherited, organised, rented, sketched, cleaned, packed, studied, swallowed, called (group 2).</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "82">The verbs were selected from Levin&apos;s classes on the basis of our intuitive judgment that they are likely to be used with sufficient frequency to be found in the corpus we had available.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "83">Further­ more, they do not generally show massive depar­ tures from the intended verb sense in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "84">(Though note that there are only 19 unaccusatives because ripped, which was initially counted in group 2 of unaccusatives, was then excluded from the analysis as it occurred mostly in a different usage in the corpus; ie, as a verb plus particle.)</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "85">yielded highly significant R=.44 between intransitive and active use, and R=.36 between intransitive and main verb (VBD) use.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "86">We discuss the effects of fea­ ture overlap in the experimental section.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "87">Most of the verbs can occur in the transitive and in the passive.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "88">Each verb presents the same form in the simple past and in the past participle, entailing that we can extract both active and pas­ sive occurrences by searching on a single token.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "89">In order to simplify the counting procedure, we made the assumption that counts on this single verb form would approximate the distribution of the features across all forms of the verb.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "90">Most counts were performed on the tagged ver­ sion of the Brown Corpus and on the portion of the Wall Street Journal distributed by the ACL/DCI (years 1987, 1988, 1989), a combined corpus in excess of 65 million words, with the exception of causativity which was counted only for the 1988 year of the WSJ, a corpus of 29 million words.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "91">3.2 Method We counted the occurrences of each verb token in a transitive or intransitive use (INTR), in an active or passive use (ACT), in a past participle or simple past use (vBD), and in a causative or non-causative use ( CAUS) .3 More precisely, the following occurrences were counted in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "92">INTR: the closest nominal group following the verb token was considered to be a potential ob­ ject of the verb.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "93">A verb occurrence immmediately followed by a potential object was counted as tran­ sitive.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "94">If no object followed, the occurrence was counted as intransitive.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "95">ACT: main verb (ie, those tagged VBD) were counted as active.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "96">Tokens with tag VBN were also counted as active if the closest preceding auxiliary was have, while they were counted as passive if the closest preceding auxiliary was be.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "97">VBD: A part-of-speech tagged corpus was used, hence the counts for VBD /VBN were simply done based on the POS label according to the tagged corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "98">CAUS: The causative feature was approximated by the following steps.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "99">First, for each verb occur­ rence subjects and objects were extracted from a parsed corpus (Collins 1997).</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "100">Then the propor 3 In performing this kind of corpus analysis, one has to take into account the fact that current corpus annotations do not distinguish verb senses.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "101">However, in these counts, we did not distinguish a core sense of the verb from an extended use of the verb.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "102">So, for instance, the sentence Consumer spending jumped 1.7 % in February after a sharp drop the month be­ fore (WSJ 1987) is counted as an occurrence of the manner-of-motion verb jump in its intransitive form.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "103">This kind of extension of meaning does not modify subcategorization distributions (Roland and Jurafsky, 1998), although it might modify the rate of causativ­ ity, but this is an unavoidable limitation at the current state of annotation of corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "104">tion of overlap between the two multisets of nouns was calculated, meant to capture the property of the causative construction that the subject of the intransitive can occur as the object of the transi­ tive.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "105">We define overlap as the largest multiset of elements belonging to both the subjects and the object multisets, e.g. {a,a,a,b}n {a}= {a, a, a}.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "106">The proportion is the ratio between the overlap and the sum of the subject and object multisets.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "107">The verbs in group 1 had been used in an earlier study, in which it was important to minimize noisy data, so they generally underwent greater man­ ual intervention in the counts.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "108">In adding group 2 for the classification experiment, we chose to min­ imize the intervention, in order to demonstrate that the classification process is robust enough to withstand the resulting noise in the data.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "109">For transitivity and voice, the method of count depended on the group.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "110">For group 1, the counts were done automatically by regular expression patterns, and then corrected, partly by hand and partly automatically.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "111">For group 2, the counts were done automatically without any manual interven­ tion.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "112">For causativity, the same counting scripts were used for both groups of verbs, but the in­ put to the counting programs was determined by manual inspection of the corpus for verbs belong­ ing to group 1, while it was extracted automati­ cally from a parsed corpus for group 2 (WSJ 1988, parsed with the parser from (Collins, 1997).</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "113">Each count was normalized over all occurrences of the verb, yielding a total of four relative fre­ quency features: VBD (%VBD tag), ACT (%active use), INTR (%intransitive use), CAUS (%causative use).4</S>

			<S sid ="154" ssid = "28">(Recall that this is a 3-way decision, hence baseline is 33%).</S>
			<S sid ="155" ssid = "29">Given the resources needed to extract the fea­ tures from the corpus and to annotate the cor­ pus itself, we need to understand the relative con­ tribution of each feature to the results - one or more of the features may make little or no con­ tribution to the successful classification behavior.</S>
			<S sid ="156" ssid = "30">Observe that when either the INTR or CAUS fea­ ture is removed (rows 2 and 3, respectively, of Ta­ ble 2), performance degrades considerably, with a decrease in accuracy of 810% from the maximum achieved with the four features (row 1).</S>
			<S sid ="157" ssid = "31">However, when the VBD feature is removed (row 4), there is a smaller decrease in accuracy, of 46%.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "32">When the ACT feature is removed (row 5), there is an 5 Available for a number of platforms from http://www.rulequest.com/.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "33">6 A 10-fold cross-validation means that the system randomly divides the data into ten parts, and runs ten times on a different 90%-training-data/10%-test-data even smaller decrease, of 24%.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "34">In fact, the accu­ racy here is very close to the accuracy of the four­ feature results when the standard error is taken into account.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "35">We conclude then that INTR and CAUS contribute the most to the accuracy of the classification, while ACT seems to contribute little.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "36">(Compare the clustering results, in which the best performance was achieved with the subset of fea­ tures excluding ACT.)</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "37">This shows that not all the linguistically relevant features are equally useful in learning.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "38">We think that this pattern of results is related to the combination of the feature distributions: some distributions are highly correlated, while others are not.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "39">According to our calculations, CAUS is not significantly correlated with any other feature; of the features that are significantly cor­ related, VBD is more highly correlated with ACT than with INTR (R=.67 and R=.36 respectively), while INTR is more highly correlated with ACT than with VBD (R=.44 and R=.36 respectively).</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "40">We expect combinations of features that are not correlated to yield better classification accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "41">If we compare the accuracy of the 3-feature com­ binations in Table 2 (rows 25), this hypothesis is confirmed.</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "42">The three combinations that contain the feature CAUS (rows 2, 4 and 5)-the uncorre­ lated feature-have better performance than the combination that does not (row 3), as expected.</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "43">Now consider the subsets of three features that include CAUS with a pair of the other correlated features.</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "44">The combination containing VBD and INTR (row 5)-the least correlated pair of the fea­ tures VBD, INTR, and ACT-has the best accuracy, while the combination containing the highly cor­ related VBD and ACT (row 2) has the worst ac­ curacy.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "45">The accuracy of the subset {vso, INTR, CAUS} (row 5) is also better than the accuracy of the subset {ACT, INTR, CAUS} (row 4), because INTR overlaps with VBD less than with ACT.7 split, yielding an average accuracy and standard error.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "46">This procedure is then repeated for 10 different ran­ dom divisions of the data, and accuracy and standard error are again averaged across the ten Funs.</S>
			<S sid ="173" ssid = "47">7 We suspect that another factor comes into play,.</S>

			<S sid ="175" ssid = "1">In this paper, we have presented an in-depth case study, in which we apply machine learning tech­ niques to automatically classify a set of verbs, based on distributional features extracted from a very large corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="176" ssid = "2">Results show that a small num­ ber of linguistically motivated grammatical fea­ tures are sufficient to halve the error rate over chance.</S>
			<S sid ="177" ssid = "3">This leads us to conclude that corpus data is a usable repository of verb class infor­ mation.</S>
			<S sid ="178" ssid = "4">On one hand, we observe that seman­ tic properties of verb classes (such as causativity) may be usefully approximated through countable features.</S>
			<S sid ="179" ssid = "5">Even with some noise, lexical proper­ ties are reflected in the corpus robustly enough to positively contribute in classification.</S>
			<S sid ="180" ssid = "6">On the other hand, however, we remark that deep lin­ guistic analysis cannot be eliminated.</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "7">In our ap­ proach, it is embedded in the selection of the fea­ tures to count.</S>
			<S sid ="182" ssid = "8">We also think that using linguisti­ cally motivated features makes the approach very effective and easily scalable: we report a 50% re­ duction in error rate, with only 4 features that are relatively straightforward to count.</S>
