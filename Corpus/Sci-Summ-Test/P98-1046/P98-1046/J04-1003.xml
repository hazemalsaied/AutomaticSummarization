			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Much research in lexical semantics has concentrated on the relation between verbs and their arguments.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Many scholars hypothesize that the behavior of a verb, particularly with respect to the expression and interpretation of its arguments, is to a large extent determined by its meaning (Talmy 1985; Jackendoff 1983; Goldberg 1995; Levin 1993; Pinker 1989; Green 1974; Gropen et al. 1989; Fillmore 1965).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">The correspondence between verbal meaning and syntax has been extensively studied in Levin (1993), which argues that verbs which display the same diathesis alternations—alternations in the realization of their argument structure—can be assumed to share certain meaning components and to form a semantically coherent class.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">The converse of this assumption is that verb behavior (i.e., participation in diathe- sis alternations) can be used to provide clues about aspects of meaning, which in turn can be exploited to characterize verb senses (referred to as classes in Levin’s [1993] terminology).</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">A major advantage of this approach is that criteria for assigning senses can be more concrete than is traditionally assumed in lexicographic work (e.g., WordNet or machine-readable dictionaries) concerned with sense distinctions (Palmer 2000).</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">As an example consider sentences (1)–(4), taken from Levin.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Examples (1) and (2) illustrate the dative and benefactive alternations, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Dative verbs alternate between the prepositional frame “NP1 V NP2 to NP3” (see (1a)) and the double-object frame “NP1 V NP2 NP3” (see (1b)), whereas benefactive verbs alternate between the double- object frame (see (2a)) and the prepositional frame “NP1 V NP2 for NP3” (see (2b)).</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">To decide whether a verb is benefactive or dative it suffices to test the acceptability of the for and to frames.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Verbs undergoing the conative alternation can be attested either as transitive or as intransitive with a prepositional phrase headed by the word at.1 The role filled by the object of the transitive variant is shared by the noun phrase complement of at in the intransitive variant (see (3)).</S>

			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">Similarly, the possessor object alternation involves a possessor and a possessed attribute that can be manifested either as the verbal object or as the object of a prepositional phrase headed by for (see (4)).</S>

			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">b. Bill sold Tom a car.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">(2) a. Martha carved the baby a toy.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">b. Martha carved a toy for the baby.</S>

			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">b. Paula hit at the fence.</S>

			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">b. I admired him for his honesty.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">Observation of the semantic and syntactic behavior of pay and give reveals that they pattern with sell in licensing the dative alternation.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">These verbs are all members of the Give class.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">Verbs like make and build behave similarly to carve in licensing the benefactive alternation and are members of the class of Build verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">The verbs beat, kick, and hit undergo the conative alternation; they are all members of the Hit verb class.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">By grouping together verbs that pattern together with respect to diathesis alternations, Levin (1993) defines approximately 200 verb classes, which she argues reflect important semantic regularities.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">These analyses (and many similar ones by Levin and her successors) rely primarily on straightforward syntactic and syntactico-semantic criteria.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">To adopt this approach is to accept some limitations on the reach of our analyses, since not all semantically interesting differences will have the appropriate reflexes in syntax.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">Nevertheless, the emphasis on concretely available observables makes Levin’s methodology a good candidate for automation (Palmer 2000).</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">Therefore, Levin’s (1993) classification has formed the basis for many efforts that aim to acquire lexical semantic information from corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "40">These exploit syntactic cues, or at least cues that are plausibly related to syntax (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2000; Lapata 1999; McCarthy 2000).</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "41">Other work has used Levin’s classification (in conjunction with other lexical resources) to create dictionaries that express the systematic correspondence between syntax and meaning (Dorr 1997; Dang, Rosenzweig, and Palmer 1997; Dorr and Jones 1996).</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "42">Levin’s inventory of verbs and classes has been also useful for applications such as machine translation (Dorr 1997; Palmer and Wu 1995), generation (Stede 1998), information retrieval (Levow, Dorr, and Lin 2000), and document classification (Klavans and Kan 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "43">Although the classification provides a general framework for describing verbal meaning, it says only which verb meanings are possible, staying silent on the relative likelihoods of the different meanings.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "44">The inventory captures systematic regularities in the meaning of words and phrases but falls short of providing a probabilistic model of these regularities.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "45">Such a model would be useful in applications that need to resolve ambiguity in the presence of multiple and conflicting probabilistic constraints.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "46">More precisely, Levin (1993) provides an index of 3,024 verbs for which she lists the semantic classes and diathesis alternations.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "47">The mapping between verbs and classes is not one to one.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "48">Of the 3,024 verbs which she covers, 784 are listed as having more than one class.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "49">Even though Levin’s monosemous verbs outnumber her polysemous verbs by a factor of nearly four to one, the total frequency of the former (4,252,715) 46 Table 1 Polysemous verbs according to Levin.</S>

			<S sid ="51" ssid = "51">is comparable to the total frequency of the latter (3,986,014).</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "52">This means that close to half of the cases processed by a semantic tagger would manifest some degree of ambiguity.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "53">The frequencies are detailed in Table 1 and were compiled from a lemma- tized version of the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard 1995).</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "54">Furthermore, as shown in Figure 1, the level of ambiguity increases in tandem with the number of alternations licensed by a given verb.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "55">Consider, for example, verbs participating in one alternation only: Of these, 90.4% have one semantic class, 8.6% have two classes, 0.7% have three classes, and 0.3% have four classes.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "56">In contrast, of the verbs licensing six different alternations, 14% have one class, 17% have two classes, 12.4% have three classes, 53.6% have four classes, 2% have six classes, and 1% have seven classes.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "57">As ambiguity increases, so does the availability and potential utility of information about diathesis alternations.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "58">Palmer (2000) and Dang et al.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "59">(1998) argue that syntactic frames and verb classes are useful for developing principled classifications of verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "60">We go beyond this, showing that they can also be of assistance in disambiguation.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "61">Consider, for instance, the verb serve, which is a member of four Levin classes: Give, Fit, Masquerade, and Fulfilling.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "62">Each of these classes can in turn license four distinct syntactic frames.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "63">47 As shown in the examples2 below, in (5a) serve appears ditransitively and belongs to the semantic class of Give verbs, in (5b) it occurs transitively and is a member of the class of Fit verbs, in (5c) it takes the predicative complement as minister of the interior and is a member of the class of Masquerade verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "64">Finally, in sentence (5d) serve is a Fulfilling verb and takes two complements, a noun phrase (an apprenticeship) and a prepositional phrase headed by to (to a still-life photographer).</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "65">In the case of verbs like serve, we can guess their semantic class solely on the basis of the frame with which they appear.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "66">(5) a. I’m desperately trying to find a venue for the reception which can serve our guests an authentic Italian meal.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "67">NP1 V NP2 NP3 b. The airline serves 164 destinations in over 75 countries.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "68">NP1 V NP2 c. JeanAntoine Chaptal was a brilliant chemist and technocrat who served Napoleon as minister of the interior from 1800 to 1805.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "69">NP1 V NP2 as NP3 d. Before her brief exposure to pop stardom, she served an apprenticeship to a still-life photographer.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "70">NP1 V NP2 to NP3 But sometimes we do not have the syntactic information that would provide cues for semantic disambiguation.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "71">Consider example (6).</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "72">The verb write is a member of three Levin classes, two of which (Message Transfer, Performance) take the double- object frame.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "73">In this case, we have the choice between the Message Transfer reading (see (6a)) and the Performance reading (see (6b)).</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "74">The same situation arises with the verb toast, which is listed as a Prepare verb and a Judgment verb; both these classes license the prepositional frame “NP1 V NP2 for NP3.” In sentence (7a) the preferred reading is that of Prepare rather than that of Judgment (see sentence (7b)).</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "75">The verb study is ambiguous among three classes when attested in the transitive frame: Learn (see example (8a)), Sight (see example (8b)), and Assessment (see example (8c)).</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "76">The verb convey, when attested in the prepositional frame “NP1 V NP2 to NP3,” can be ambiguous between the Say class (see example (9a)) and the Send class (see example (9b)).</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "77">In order to correctly decide the semantic class for a given ambiguous verb, we would need not only detailed semantic information about the verb’s arguments, but also a considerable amount of world knowledge.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "78">Admittedly, selectional restrictions are sufficient for distinguishing (7a) from (7b) (one normally heats up inanimate entities and salutes animate ones), but selectional restrictions alone are probably not enough to disambiguate (6a) from (6b), since both letter and screenplay are likely to be described as written material.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "79">Rather, we need fine-grained world knowledge: Both scripts and letters can be written for someone: only letters can be written to someone.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "80">(6) a. A solicitor wrote him a letter at the airport.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "81">b. I want you to write me a screenplay called “The Trip.” (7) a. He sat by the fire and toasted a piece of bread for himself.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "82">b. We all toasted Nigel for his recovery.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "83">2 Unless otherwise stated, our example sentences were taken (possibly in simplified form) from the BNC..</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "84">48 (8) a. Chapman studied medicine at Cambridge.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "85">b. Romanov studied the old man carefully, looking for some sign that he knew exactly what had been awaiting him at the bank.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "86">c. The alliance will also study the possibility of providing service to other high-volume products, such as IBM and multi-vendor workstations.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "87">(9) a. By conveying the news to her sister, she would convey by implication something of her own anxiety.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "88">b. The judge signed the committal warrant and the police conveyed Mr. Butler to prison, giving the warrant to the governor.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "89">This need for world knowledge (or at least a convenient way of approximating this knowledge) is not an isolated phenomenon but manifests itself across a variety of classes and frames (e.g., double object, transitive, prepositional frame: see examples (6)–(9)).</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "90">We have argued that the concreteness of Levin-style verb classes is an advantage, but this advantage would be compromised if we tried to fold too much world knowledge into the classification.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "91">We do not do this.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "92">Instead, Section 5 of the current article describes disambiguation experiments in which our probabilistic Levin classes are used in tandem with proxies for appropriate world knowledge.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "93">It is important to point out that Levin’s (1993) classification is not intended as an exhaustive description of English verbs, their meanings, and their likelihood.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "94">Many other classifications could have been built using the same principles.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "95">A different grouping might, for example, have occurred if finer or coarser semantic distinctions were taken into account (see Merlo and Stevenson [2001] and Dang, Rosenzweig, and Palmer [1997] for alternative classifications) or if the containment of ambiguity was one of the classification objectives.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "96">As pointed out by Kipper, Dang, and Palmer (2000), Levin classes exhibit inconsistencies, and verbs are listed in multiple classes, some of which have conflicting sets of syntactic frames.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "97">This means that some ambiguities may also arise as a result of accidental errors or inconsistencies.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "98">The classification was created not with computational uses in mind, but for human readers, so it has not been necessary to remedy all the errors and omissions that might cause trouble for machines.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "99">Similar issues arise in almost all efforts to make use of preexisting lexical resources for computational purposes (Briscoe and Carroll 1997), so none of the above comments should be taken as criticisms of Levin’s achievement.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "100">The objective of this article is to show how to train and use a probabilistic version of Levin’s classification in verb sense disambiguation.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "101">We treat errors and inconsistencies in the classification as noise.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "102">Although all our tests have used Levin’s classes and the British National Corpus, the method itself depends neither on the details of Levin’s classification nor on parochial facts about the English language.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "103">Our future work will include tests on other languages, other classifications, and other corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "104">The model developed in this article takes as input a partially parsed corpus and generates, for each combination of a verb and its syntactic frame, a probability distribution over the available verb classes.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "105">The corpus itself does not have to be labeled with classes.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "106">This makes it feasible to use large corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "107">Our model is not immediately useful for disambiguation, because it cannot discriminate among different occurrences of the same verb and frame, but it can (as we show in Section 5) be used as a prior in a full disambiguation system that does take appropriate account of context.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "108">The model relies on several gross simplifications; it does not take selectional restrictions, discourse, or pragmatic information into account but is demonstrably superior to simpler priors that make no use of subcategorization.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "109">49 The remainder of this article is organized as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "110">In Section 2 we describe the probabilistic model and the estimation of the various model parameters.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "111">In Sections 3 and 4 we report on the results of two experiments that use the model to derive the dominant class for polysemous verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "112">Sections 5 and 6 discuss our verb class disambiguation experiments.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "113">We base our results on the BNC, a 100-million-word collection of samples of written and spoken language from a wide range of sources designed to represent a wide cross-section of current British English, both spoken and written (Burnard 1995).</S>

	<SECTION title="The Prior Model. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "1">Consider again the sentences in (6).</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "2">Assuming that we more often write something to someone rather than for someone, we would like to derive Message Transfer as the prevalent class for write rather than Performance.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "3">We view the choice of a class for a polysemous verb in a given frame as maximizing the joint probability P(c, f , v), where v is a verb subcategorizing for the frame f and inhabiting more than one Levin class c: P(c, f , v) = P(v) · P(f |v) · P(c|v, f ) (10) Although the terms P(v) and P(f |v) can be estimated from the BNC (P(v) reduces to the number of times a verb is attested in the corpus, and P(f |v) can be obtained through parsing), the estimation of P(c|v, f ) is somewhat problematic, since it relies on the frequency F(c, v, f ).</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "4">The latter could be obtained straightforwardly if we hadaccess to a parsed corpus annotated with subcategorization and semantic-class infor mation.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "5">Lacking such a corpus we will assume that the semantic class determines the subcategorization patterns of its members independently of their identity (see (11)): P(c|v, f ) ≈ P(c|f ) (11) The independence assumption is a simplification of Levin’s (1993) hypothesis that the argument structure of a given verb is a direct reflection of its meaning.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "6">The rationale behind the approximation in (11) is that since class formation is determined on the basis of diathesis alternations, it is the differences in subcategorization structure, rather than the identity of the individual verbs, that determine class likelihood.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "7">For example, if we know that some verb subcategorizes for the double object and the prepositional “NP1 V NP2 to NP3” frames, we can guess that it is a member of the Give class or the Message Transfer class without knowing whether this verb is give, write, or tell.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "8">Note that the approximation in (11) assumes that verbs of the same class uniformly subcategorize (or not) for a given frame.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "9">This is evidently not true for all classes of verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "10">For example, all Give verbs undergo the dative diathesis alternation, and therefore we would expect them to be attested in both the double-object and prepositional frame, but only a subset of Create verbs undergo the benefactive alternation.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "11">For example, the verb invent is a Create verb and can be attested only in the benefactive prepositional frame (I will invent a tool for you versus ?I will invent you a tool; see Levin [1993] for details).</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "12">By applying Bayes’ law we write P(c|f ) as P(f |c) · P(c) P(c|f ) = (12) P(f ) By substituting (12) into (10), we can write P(c, f , v) as P(c, f , v) = P(v) · P(f |v) · P(f |c) · P(c) P(f ) (13) 50 Estimation of model parameters.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "13">F(f , v) F(f , c) (a) Pˆ(v) = F(v) F ( v i ) i (b) Pˆ(f |v) = F(v) (c) Pˆ(f |c) = F(c) (d) Pˆ(c) = F(c) F ( c i ) i (e) Pˆ(f ) = F(f ) F ( f i ) i (f) F( f , c) = F(c, f , vi ) i (g) F(c) = F(vi , c) (h) F(v, c) = F(v) · P(c|v) i It is easy to obtain P(v) from the lemmatized BNC (see (a) in Table 2).</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "14">In order to estimate the probability P(f |v), we need to know how many times a verb is attested with a given frame.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "15">We acquired Levin-compatible subcategorization frames from the BNC after performing a coarse-grained mapping between Levin’s frame descriptions and surface syntactic patterns without preserving detailed semantic information about argument structure and thematic roles.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "16">This resulted in 80 frame types that were grossly compatible with Levin.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "17">We used Gsearch (Corley et al. 2001), a tool that facilitates the search of arbitrary part-of-speech-tagged corpora for shallow syntactic patterns based on a user-specified context-free grammar and a syntactic query.</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "18">We specified a chunk grammar for recognizing the verbal complex, NPs, and PPs and used Gsearch to extract tokens matching the frames specified in Levin.</S>
			<S sid ="133" ssid = "19">We discarded all frames with a frequency smaller than five, as they were likely to be unreliable given our heuristic approach.</S>
			<S sid ="134" ssid = "20">The frame probability P(f ) (see the denominator in (13) and equation (e) in Table 2) was also estimated on the basis of the Levin-compatible subcategorization frames that were acquired from the BNC.</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "21">We cannot read off P(f |c) in (13) directly from the corpus, because the corpus is not annotated with verb classes.</S>
			<S sid ="136" ssid = "22">Nevertheless Levin’s (1993) classification records the syntactic frames that are licensed by a given verb class (for example, Give verbs license the double object and the “NP1 V NP2 to NP3” frame) and also the number and type of classes a given verb exhibits (e.g., write inhabits two classes, Performance and Message Transfer).</S>
			<S sid ="137" ssid = "23">Furthermore, we know how many times a given verb is attested with a certain frame in the corpus, as we have acquired Levin-compatible frames from the BNC (see (b) in Table 2).</S>
			<S sid ="138" ssid = "24">We first explain how we obtain F(f , c), which we rewrite as the sum of all occurrences of verbs v that are members of class c and are attested in the corpus with frame f (see (c) and (f) in Table 2).</S>
			<S sid ="139" ssid = "25">For monosemous verbs the count F(c, f , v) reduces to the number of times these verbs have been attested in the corpus with a certain frame.</S>
			<S sid ="140" ssid = "26">For polysemous verbs, we additionally need to know the class in which they were attested in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="141" ssid = "27">Note that we don’t necessarily need an annotated corpus for class-ambiguous verbs whose classes license distinct frames (see example (5)), provided that we have extracted verb frames relatively accurately.</S>
			<S sid ="142" ssid = "28">For genuinely ambiguous verbs (i.e., verbs licensed by classes that take the same frame), given that we don’t have access to a corpus annotated with verb class information, we distribute the frequency of the verb and its frame evenly across its semantic classes: F(c, f , v) = F(f , v) |classes(v, f )| (14) Here F(f , v) is the co-occurrence frequency of a verb and its frame and |classes(v, f )| is the number of classes verb v is a member of when found with frame f .

			<S sid ="144" ssid = "30">Table 3 shows the estimation of the frequency F(c, f , v) for six verbs that are members of the Give class.</S>
			<S sid ="145" ssid = "31">Consider for example feed, which is a member of four classes: Give, Gorge, Feeding, and Fit.</S>
			<S sid ="146" ssid = "32">Of these classes, only Feeding and Give license the double-object and prepositional frames.</S>
			<S sid ="147" ssid = "33">This is why the co-occurrence frequency of feed with these frames is divided by two.</S>
			<S sid ="148" ssid = "34">The verb serve inhabits four classes.</S>
			<S sid ="149" ssid = "35">The double-object frame is licensed by the Give class, whereas the prepositional frame is additionally licensed by the Fulfilling class, and therefore the co-occurrence frequency F(NPVNPtoNP, serve) is equally distributed between these two classes.</S>
			<S sid ="150" ssid = "36">This is clearly a simplification, since one would expect F(c, f , v) to vary for different verb classes.</S>
			<S sid ="151" ssid = "37">However, note that according to this estimation, F(f , c) will vary across frames reflecting differences in the likelihood of a class being attested with a certain frame.</S>
			<S sid ="152" ssid = "38">Both terms P(f |c) and P(c) in (13) rely on the class frequency F(c) (see (c) and (d) in Table 2).</S>
			<S sid ="153" ssid = "39">We rewrite F(c) as the sum of all verbs attested in the corpus with class c (see (g) in Table 2).</S>
			<S sid ="154" ssid = "40">For monosemous verbs the estimate of F(v, c) reduces to the count of the verb in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="155" ssid = "41">Once again we cannot estimate F(v, c) for polysemous verbs directly.</S>
			<S sid ="156" ssid = "42">The task would be straightforward if we had a corpus of verbs, each labeled explicitly with class information.</S>
			<S sid ="157" ssid = "43">All we have is the overall frequency of a given verb in the BNC and the number of classes it is a member of according to Levin (1993).</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "44">Since polysemous verbs can generally be the realization of more than one semantic class, counts of semantic classes can be constructed by dividing the contribution from the verb by the number of classes it belongs to (Resnik 1993; Lauer 1995).</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "45">We rewrite the frequency F(v, c) as shown in (h) in Table 2 and approximate P(c|v), the true distribution of the verb and its classes, as follows: F(v) P(c|v) ≈ |classes(v)| (15) Here, F(v) is the number of times the verb v was observed in the corpus and |classes(v)| is the number of classes c it belongs to.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "46">For example, in order to estimate the frequency of the class Give, we consider all verbs that are listed as members of this class in Levin (1993).</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "47">The class contains thirteen verbs, among which six are polysemous.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "48">We will obtain F(Give) by taking into account the verb frequency of the monosemous verbs(|classes(v)| is one in this case) as well as distributing the frequency of the polyse mous verbs among their classes.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "49">For example, feed inhabits the classes Give, Gorge, 52 Feeding, and Fit and occurs in the corpus 3,263 times.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "50">We will increment the count of F(Give) by 3,263 . Table 3 illustrates the estimation of F(v, c) for six members of the Give class.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "51">The total frequency of the class is obtained by summing over the individual values of F(v, c) (see equation (g) in Table 2).</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "52">The approach in (15) relies on the simplifying assumption that the frequency of a verb is distributed evenly across its semantic classes.</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "53">This is clearly not true for all verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "54">Consider, for example, the verb rent, which inhabits classes Give (Frank rented Peter his room) and Get (I rented my flat for my sister).</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "55">Intuitively speaking, the Give sense of rent is more frequent than the Get sense, however, this is not taken into account in (15), primarily because we do not know the true distribution of the classes for rent.</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "56">An alternative to (15) is to distribute the verb frequency unequally among verb classes.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "57">Even though we don’t know how likely classes are in relation to a particular verb, we can approximate how likely classes are in general on the basis of their size (i.e., number of verbs that are members of each class).</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "58">So then we can distribute a verb’s frequency unequally, according to class size.</S>
			<S sid ="173" ssid = "59">This time we approximate P(c|v) (see (h) in Table 2) by P(c|amb class), the probability of class c given the ambiguity class3 amb class.</S>
			<S sid ="174" ssid = "60">The latter represents the set of classes a verb might inhabit: F(v, c) ≈ F(v) · P(c|amb class) (16) We collapse verbs into ambiguity classes in order to reduce the number of parameters that must be estimated; we certainly lose information, but the approximation makes it easier to get reliable estimates from limited data.</S>
			<S sid ="175" ssid = "61">We simply approximate P(c|amb class) using a heuristic based on class size: P(c|amb class) ≈ |c| c ∈ amb class |c| (17) For each class we recorded the number of its members after discarding verbs whose frequency was less than one per million in the BNC.</S>
			<S sid ="176" ssid = "62">This gave us a first approximation of the size of each class.</S>
			<S sid ="177" ssid = "63">We then computed, for each polysemous verb, the total size of the classes of which it was a member.</S>
			<S sid ="178" ssid = "64">We calculated P(c|amb class) by dividing the former by the latter (see equation (17)).</S>
			<S sid ="179" ssid = "65">We obtained the class frequency F(c) by multiplying P(c|amb class) by the observed frequency of the verb in the BNC (see equation (16)).</S>
			<S sid ="180" ssid = "66">As an example, consider again F(Give), which is calculated by summing over all verbs that are members of this class (see (g) in Table 2).</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "67">In order to add the contribution of the verb feed, we need to distribute its corpus frequency among the classes Give, Gorge, Feed, and Fit.</S>
			<S sid ="182" ssid = "68">The respective P(c|amb class) values for these classes are 15 , 8 , 3 , and 12 . By multiplying these by the frequency of feed in 38 38 38 38 the BNC (3,263), we obtain the values of F(v, c) given in Table 4.</S>
			<S sid ="183" ssid = "69">Only the frequency F(feed, Give) is relevant for F(Give).</S>
			<S sid ="184" ssid = "70">The estimation process just described involves at least one gross simplification, since P(c|amb class) is calculated without reference to the identity of the verb in question.</S>
			<S sid ="185" ssid = "71">For any two verbs that fall into the same set of classes, P(c|amb class) will be the same, even though one or both may be atypical in its distribution across the classes.</S>
			<S sid ="186" ssid = "72">Furthermore, the estimation tends to favor large classes, again irrespectively of the identity of the verb in question.</S>

			<S sid ="226" ssid = "112">A large number of classes license the frames that are relevant for these alternations and the verbs that inhabit these classes are likely to exhibit class ambiguity: 20 classes license the double object frame, 22 license the prepositional frame “NP1 V NP2 to NP3,” 17 classes license the benefactive “NP1 V NP2 for NP3” frame, 118 (out of 200) classes license the transitive frame, and 15 classes license the conative “NP1 V at NP2” frame.</S>

			<S sid ="281" ssid = "9">Given the restriction that these verbs be semantically ambiguous in a specific syntactic frame, we could not simply sample from the entire BNC, since this would decrease the chances of finding the verb in the frame we are interested in.

	</SECTION>
	<SECTION title="Class Disambiguation. " number = "5">
			<S sid ="340" ssid = "1">In the previous sections we focused on deriving a model of the distribution of Levin classes without relying on annotated data and showed that this model infers the right class for genuinely ambiguous verbs 74.6% of the time without taking the local context of their occurrence into account.</S>
			<S sid ="341" ssid = "2">An obvious question is whether this information is useful for disambiguating tokens rather than types.</S>
			<S sid ="342" ssid = "3">In the following we report on a disambiguation experiment that takes advantage of this prior information.</S>
			<S sid ="343" ssid = "4">Word sense disambiguation is often cast as a problem in supervised learning, where a disambiguator is induced from a corpus of manually sense-tagged text.</S>
			<S sid ="344" ssid = "5">The context within which the ambiguous word occurs is typically represented by a set of linguistically motivated features from which a learning algorithm induces a representative model that performs the disambiguation.</S>
			<S sid ="345" ssid = "6">A variety of classifiers have been employed for this task (see Mooney [1996] and Ide and Veronis [1998] for overviews), the most popular being decision lists (Yarowsky 1994, 1995) and naive Bayesian classifiers (Pedersen 2000; Ng 1997; Pedersen and Bruce 1998; Mooney 1996; Cucerzan and Yarowsky 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="346" ssid = "7">We employed a naive Bayesian classifier (Duda and Hart 1973) for our experiments, as it is a very convenient framework for incorporating prior knowledge and studying its influence on the classification task.</S>
			<S sid ="347" ssid = "8">In Section 5.1 we describe a basic naive Bayesian classifier and show how it can be extended with informative priors.</S>
			<S sid ="348" ssid = "9">In Section 5.2 we discuss the types of contextual features we use.</S>
			<S sid ="349" ssid = "10">We report on our experimental results in Section 6.</S>
			<S sid ="350" ssid = "11">5.1 Naive Bayes Classification.</S>
			<S sid ="351" ssid = "12">A naive Bayesian classifier assumes that all the feature variables representing a prob lem are conditionally independent, given the value of the classification variable.</S>
			<S sid ="352" ssid = "13">In word sense disambiguation, the features (a1 , a2 , ...</S>
			<S sid ="353" ssid = "14">, an ) represent the context surrounding the ambiguous word, and the classification variable c is the sense (Levin class in our case) of the ambiguous word in this particular context.</S>
			<S sid ="354" ssid = "15">Within a naive Bayes approach, the probability of the class c given its context can be expressed as P(c|ai ) = n P(c) fl P(ai |c) i=1 (18 ) P(ai ) where P(ai |c) is the probability that a test example is of class c given the contextual features ai . Since the denominator P(ai ) is constant for all classes c, the problem reduces to finding the class c with the maximum value for the numerator: n P(c|ai ) ≈ P(c) n P(ai |c) (19) i=1 60 If we choose the prior P(c) to be uniform (P(c) = 1 |c| for all c ∈ C), (19) can be further simplified to n P(c|a) ≈ n P(ai |c) (20) i=1 Assuming a uniform prior, a basic naive Bayesian classifier is as follows: n ∗ c = n P(ai |c) (21) i=1 Note, however, that we developed in the previous section two types of non- uniform prior models.</S>
			<S sid ="355" ssid = "16">The first model derives P(c) heuristically from the BNC, ignoring the identity of the polysemous verb and its subcategorization profile, and the second model estimates the class distribution P(c, v, f ) by taking the frame distribution into account.</S>
			<S sid ="356" ssid = "17">So, the naive Bayesian classifier in (21) can be extended with a nonuniform prior: n ∗ c = P(c) n P(ai |c) (22) i=1 n ∗ c = P(c, v, f ) n P(ai |c, f , v) (23) i=1 where P(c) is estimated as shown in (d)–(g) in Table 2 and P(c, v, f ), the prior for each class c corresponding to verb v in frame f , is estimated as explained in Sec tion 2 (see (13)).</S>
			<S sid ="357" ssid = "18">As before, ai are the contextual features.</S>
			<S sid ="358" ssid = "19">The probabilities P(ai |c)and P(ai |c, f , v) can be estimated from the training data simply by counting the co occurrence of feature ai with class c (for (22)) or the co-occurrence of ai with class c, verb v, and frame f (for (23)).</S>
			<S sid ="359" ssid = "20">For features that have zero counts, we use add-k smoothing (Johnson 1932), where k is a number less than one.</S>
			<S sid ="360" ssid = "21">5.2 Feature Space.</S>
			<S sid ="361" ssid = "22">As is common in word sense disambiguation studies, we experimented with two typesof context representations, collocations and co-occurrences.</S>
			<S sid ="362" ssid = "23">Co-occurrences simply in dicate whether a given word occurs within some number of words to the left or right of an ambiguous word.</S>
			<S sid ="363" ssid = "24">In this case the contextual features are binary and represent the presence or absence of a particular word in the current or preceding sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="364" ssid = "25">We used four types of context in our experiments: left context (i.e., words occurring to the left of the ambiguous word), right context (i.e., words occurring to the right of the ambiguous word), the current sentence (i.e., words surrounding the ambiguous word),and the current sentence together with its immediately preceding sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="365" ssid = "26">Punctua tion and capitalization were removed from the windows of context; noncontent words were included.</S>
			<S sid ="366" ssid = "27">The context words were represented as lemmas or parts of speech.Collocations are words that are frequently adjacent to the word to be disam biguated.</S>
			<S sid ="367" ssid = "28">We considered 12 types of collocations.</S>
			<S sid ="368" ssid = "29">Examples of collocations for the verb write are illustrated in Table 13.</S>
			<S sid ="369" ssid = "30">The L columns in the table indicate the number of words to the left of the ambiguous words, and the R columns, the number of words to the right.</S>
			<S sid ="370" ssid = "31">So for example, the collocation 1L3R represents one word to the left and three words to the right of the ambiguous word.</S>
			<S sid ="371" ssid = "32">Collocations again were represented as lemmas (see Table 13) or parts of speech.</S>

			<S sid ="375" ssid = "2">We tested the performance of our naive Bayesian classifiers on the 67 genuinely am biguous verbs on which the prior models were tested.</S>
			<S sid ="376" ssid = "3">Recall that these models were trained without access to a disambiguated corpus, which was used only to determine for a given verb and its frame its most likely meaning overall (i.e., across the corpus) instead of focusing on the meaning of individual corpus tokens.</S>
			<S sid ="377" ssid = "4">The same corpus was used for the disambiguation of individual tokens, excluding tokens assigned theclass Other.</S>
			<S sid ="378" ssid = "5">The naive Bayes classifiers were trained and tested using 10-fold cross validation on a set of 5,002 examples.</S>
			<S sid ="379" ssid = "6">These were representative of the frames “NP1 V NP2,” “NP1 V NP2 NP3,” “NP1 V NP2 to NP3,” and “NP1 V NP2 for NP3.” The frame “NP1 V at NP2” was excluded from our disambiguation experiments as it was represented solely by the verb kick (50 instances).</S>
			<S sid ="380" ssid = "7">In this study we compare a naive Bayesian classifier that relies on a uniform prior (see (20)) against two classifiers that make use of nonuniform prior models: The classifier in (22) effectively uses as prior the baseline model P(c) from Section 2, whereas the classifier in (23) relies on the more informative model P(c, f , v).</S>
			<S sid ="381" ssid = "8">As a baseline for the disambiguation task, we simply assign the most common class in the training data to every instance in the test data, ignoring context and any form of prior information (Pedersen 2001; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992a).</S>
			<S sid ="382" ssid = "9">We also report an upper bound on disambiguation performance by measuring how well human judges agree with one another (percentage agreement) on the class assignment task.</S>

	<SECTION title="Discussion. " number = "7">
			<S sid ="411" ssid = "1">In this article, we have presented a probabilistic model of verb class ambiguity based on Levin’s (1993) semantic classification.</S>
			<S sid ="412" ssid = "2">Our results show that subcategorization information acquired automatically from corpora provides important cues for verb class disambiguation (Experiment 1).</S>
			<S sid ="413" ssid = "3">In the absence of subcategorization cues, corpus-based distributions and quantitative approximations of linguistic concepts can be used to derive a preference ordering on the set of verbal meanings (Experiment 2).</S>
			<S sid ="414" ssid = "4">The semantic preferences that we have generated can be thought of as default semantic knowledge, to be used in the absence of any explicit contextual or lexical semantic information to the contrary (see Table 12).</S>
			<S sid ="415" ssid = "5">We have also shown that these preferences are useful for disambiguating polysemous verbs within their local contexts of occurrence (Experiment 3).</S>
			<S sid ="416" ssid = "6">The approach is promising in that it achieves satisfactory results with a simple model that has a straightforward interpretation in a Bayesian framework and does not 64 rely on the availability of annotated data.</S>
			<S sid ="417" ssid = "7">The model’s parameters are estimated using simple distributions that can be extracted easily from corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="418" ssid = "8">Our model achieved an accuracy of 93.9% (over a baseline of 56.7%) on the class disambiguation task (Experiment 1) and an accuracy of 74.6% (over a baseline of 46.2%) on the task of deriving dominant verb classes (Experiment 2).</S>
			<S sid ="419" ssid = "9">Our disambiguation experiments reveal that this default semantic knowledge, when incorporated as a prior in a naive Bayes classifier, outperforms the uniform prior and the baseline of always defaulting to the most frequent class (Experiment 3).</S>
			<S sid ="420" ssid = "10">In fact, for three out of the four frames under study, our classifier with the informative prior achieved upper-bound performance.</S>
			<S sid ="421" ssid = "11">Although our results are promising, it remains to be shown that they generalize across frames and alternations.</S>
			<S sid ="422" ssid = "12">Four types of alternations were investigated in this study.</S>
			<S sid ="423" ssid = "13">However, Levin lists 79 alternations and approximately 200 classes.</S>
			<S sid ="424" ssid = "14">Although distributions for different class/frame combinations can easily be derived automatically, it remains to be shown that these distributions are useful for all verbs, frames, and classes.</S>
			<S sid ="425" ssid = "15">Also note that the models described in the previous sections crucially rely on the acquisition of relatively accurate frames from the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="426" ssid = "16">It is a matter of future work to examine how the quality of the acquired frames influences the disambiguation task.</S>
			<S sid ="427" ssid = "17">Also, the assumption that the semantic class determines the subcategorization patterns of its class members independently of their identity may not be harmless for all classes and frames.</S>
			<S sid ="428" ssid = "18">Although our original aim was to develop a probabilistic framework that exploits Levin’s (1993) linguistic classification and the systematic correspondence between syntax and semantics, a limitation of the model is that it cannot infer class information for verbs not listed in Levin.</S>
			<S sid ="429" ssid = "19">For these verbs, P(c), and hence P(c, f , v), will be zero.</S>
			<S sid ="430" ssid = "20">Recent work in computational linguistics (e.g., Schu¨ tze 1998) and cognitive psychology (e.g., Landauer and Dumais 1997) has shown that large corpora implicitly contain semantic information, which can be extracted and manipulated in the form of co-occurrence vectors.</S>
			<S sid ="431" ssid = "21">One possible approach would be to compute the centroid (geometric mean) of the vectors of all members of a semantic class.</S>
			<S sid ="432" ssid = "22">Given an unknown verb (i.e., a verb not listed in Levin), we can decide its semantic class by comparing its semantic vector to the centroids of all semantic classes.</S>
			<S sid ="433" ssid = "23">For example, we could determine class membership on the basis of the distance to the closest centroid representing a semantic class (see Patel, Billinaria, and Levy [1998] for a proposal similar in spirit).</S>
			<S sid ="434" ssid = "24">Another approach put forward by Dorr and Jones (1996) utilizes WordNet (Miller and Charles 1991) to find similarities (via synonymy) between unknown verbs and verbs listed in Levin.</S>
			<S sid ="435" ssid = "25">Once we have chosen a class for an unknown verb, we are entitled to assume that it will share the broad syntactic and semantic properties of that class.</S>

			<S sid ="437" ssid = "2">Previous work in word sense disambiguation has not tackled explicitly the ambiguity problems arising from Levin’s classification, although methods for deriving informative priors in an unsupervised manner have been proposed by Ciaramita and Johnson (2000) and Chao and Dyer (2000) within the context of noun and adjective sense disambiguation, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="438" ssid = "3">In this section we review related work on classification and lexicon acquisition and compare it to our own work.</S>
			<S sid ="439" ssid = "4">65 Dang et al.</S>
			<S sid ="440" ssid = "5">(1998) observe that verbs in Levin’s (1993) database are listed in more than one class.</S>
			<S sid ="441" ssid = "6">The precise meaning of this ambiguity is left open to interpretation in Levin, as it may indicate that the verb has more than one sense or that one sense (i.e., class) is primary and the alternations for this class should take precedence over the alternations for the other classes for which the verb is listed.</S>
			<S sid ="442" ssid = "7">Dang et al. augment Levin’s semantic classes with a set of “intersective” classes that are created by grouping together sets of existing classes that share a minimum of three overlapping members.</S>
			<S sid ="443" ssid = "8">Intersective classes are more fine-grained than the original Levin classes and exhibit more-coherent sets of syntactic frames and associated semantic components.</S>
			<S sid ="444" ssid = "9">Dang et al. further argue that intersective classes are more compatible with WordNet than the broader Levin classes and thus make it possible to attribute the semantic components and associated sets of syntactic frames to specific WordNet senses as well, thereby enriching the WordNet representation and providing explicit criteria for word sense disambiguation.</S>
			<S sid ="445" ssid = "10">Most statistical approaches, including ours, treat verbal-meaning assignment as a semantic classification task.</S>
			<S sid ="446" ssid = "11">The underlying question is the following: How can corpus information be exploited in deriving the semantic class for a given verb?</S>
			<S sid ="447" ssid = "12">Despite the unifying theme of using corpora and corpus distributions for the acquisition task, the approaches differ in the inventory of classes they employ, in the methodology used for inferring semantic classes, and in the specific assumptions concerning the verbs to be classified (e.g., can they be polysemous or not).</S>
			<S sid ="448" ssid = "13">Merlo and Stevenson (2001) use grammatical features (acquired from corpora) to classify verbs into three semantic classes: unergative, unaccusative, and object drop.</S>
			<S sid ="449" ssid = "14">These classes are abstractions of Levin’s (1993) classes and as a result yield a coarser classification.</S>
			<S sid ="450" ssid = "15">For example, object-drop verbs comprise a variety of Levin classes such as Gesture verbs, Caring verbs, Load verbs, Push-Pull verbs, Meet verbs, Social Interaction verbs, and Amuse verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="451" ssid = "16">Unergative, unaccusative, and object-drop verbs have identical subcategorization patterns (i.e., they alternate between the transitive and intransitive frame), yet distinct argument structures, and therefore differ in the thematic roles they assign to their arguments.</S>
			<S sid ="452" ssid = "17">For example, when attested in the intransitive frame, the subject of an object-drop verb is an agent, whereas the subject of an unaccusative verb is a theme.</S>
			<S sid ="453" ssid = "18">Under the assumption that differences in thematic role assignment uniquely identify semantic classes, numeric approximations of argument structure are derived from corpora and used in a machine-learning paradigm to place verbs in their semantic classes.</S>
			<S sid ="454" ssid = "19">The approach is evaluated on 59 verbs manually selected from Levin (20 unergatives, 20 object drops, and 19 unaccusatives).</S>
			<S sid ="455" ssid = "20">It is assumed that these verbs are monosemous, that is, they can be ergative, unergative, or object drop.</S>
			<S sid ="456" ssid = "21">A decision-tree learner achieves an accuracy of 69.8% on the classification task over a chance baseline of 34%.</S>
			<S sid ="457" ssid = "22">Schulte im Walde (2000) uses subcategorization information and selectional restrictions to cluster verbs into Levin (1993)–compatible semantic classes.</S>
			<S sid ="458" ssid = "23">Subcategorization frames are induced from the BNC using a robust statistical parser (Carroll and Rooth 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="459" ssid = "24">The selectional restrictions are acquired using Resnik’s (1993) information- theoretic measure of selectional association, which combines distributional and taxonomic information (e.g., WordNet) to formalize how well a predicate associates with a given argument.</S>
			<S sid ="460" ssid = "25">Two sets of experiments are run to evaluate the contribution of selectional restrictions using two types of clustering algorithms: iterative clustering and latent-class clustering (see Schulte im Walde [2000] for details).</S>
			<S sid ="461" ssid = "26">The approach is evaluated on 153 verbs taken from Levin, 53 of which are polysemous (i.e., belong to more than one class).</S>
			<S sid ="462" ssid = "27">The size of the derived clusters is restricted to four verbs and compared to Levin: Verbs are classified correctly if they are members of a nonsingleton cluster 66 that is a subset of a Levin class.</S>
			<S sid ="463" ssid = "28">Polysemous verbs can be assigned to distinct clusters only using the latent-class clustering method.</S>
			<S sid ="464" ssid = "29">The best results achieve a recall of 36% and a precision of 61% (over a baseline of 5%, calculated as the number of randomly created clusters that are subsets of a Levin class) using subcategorization information only and iterative clustering.</S>
			<S sid ="465" ssid = "30">Inclusion of information about selectional restrictions yields a lower accuracy of 38% (with a recall of 20%), again using iterative clustering.</S>
			<S sid ="466" ssid = "31">Dorr and Jones (1996) use Levin’s (1993) classification to show that there is a predictable relationship between verbal meaning and syntactic behavior.</S>
			<S sid ="467" ssid = "32">They create a database of Levin verb classes and the sentences exemplifying them (including both positive and negative examples, i.e., examples marked with asterisks).</S>
			<S sid ="468" ssid = "33">A parser is used to extract basic syntactic patterns for each semantic class.</S>
			<S sid ="469" ssid = "34">These patterns form the syntactic signature of the class.</S>
			<S sid ="470" ssid = "35">Dorr and Jones show that 97.9% of the semantic classes can be identified uniquely by their syntactic signatures.</S>
			<S sid ="471" ssid = "36">Grouping verbs (instead of classes) with identical signatures to form a semantic class yields a 6.3% overlap with Levin classes.</S>
			<S sid ="472" ssid = "37">Dorr and Jones’s results are somewhat difficult to interpret, since in practice information about a verb and its syntactic signature is not available, and it is precisely this information that is crucial for classifying verbs into Levin classes.</S>
			<S sid ="473" ssid = "38">Schulte im Walde’s study and our own study show that acquisition of syntactic signatures (i.e., subcategorization frames) from corpora is feasible; however, these acquired signatures are not necessarily compatible with Levin and in most cases will depart from those derived by Dorr and Jones, as negative examples are not available in real corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="474" ssid = "39">Ciaramita and Johnson (2000) propose an unsupervised Bayesian model for dis- ambiguating verbal objects that uses WordNet’s inventory of senses.</S>
			<S sid ="475" ssid = "40">For each verb the model creates a Bayesian network whose architecture is determined by WordNet’s hierarchy and whose parameters are estimated from a list of verb-object pairs found in a corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="476" ssid = "41">A common problem for unsupervised models trained on verb-object tuples is that the objects can belong to more than one semantic class.</S>
			<S sid ="477" ssid = "42">The class ambiguity problem is commonly resolved by considering each observation of an object as evidence for each of the classes the word belongs to.</S>
			<S sid ="478" ssid = "43">The formalization of the problem in terms of Bayesian networks allows the contribution of different senses to be weighted via explaining away (Pearl 1988): If A is a hyponym of B and C is a hyponym of B, and B is true, then finding that C is true makes A less likely.</S>
			<S sid ="479" ssid = "44">Prior knowledge about the likelihoods of concepts is hand coded in the network according to the following principles: (1) It is unlikely that any given class will be a priori selected for; (2) if a class is selected, then its hyponyms are also likely to be selected; (3) a word is likely as the object of a verb, if at least one of its classes is selected for.</S>
			<S sid ="480" ssid = "45">Likely and unlikely here correspond to numbers that sum up to to one.</S>
			<S sid ="481" ssid = "46">Ciaramita and Johnson show that their model outperforms other word sense disambiguation approaches that do not make use of prior knowledge.</S>
			<S sid ="482" ssid = "47">Chao and Dyer (2000) propose a method for the disambiguation of polysemous adjectives in adjective-noun combinations that also uses Bayesian networks and Word- Net’s taxonomic information.</S>
			<S sid ="483" ssid = "48">Prior knowledge about the likelihood of different senses or semantic classes is derived heuristically by submitting queries (e.g., great hurricane) to the AltaVista search engine and extrapolating from the number of returned documents the frequency of the adjective-noun pair (see Mihalcea and Moldovan [1998] for details of this technique).</S>
			<S sid ="484" ssid = "49">For each polysemous adjective-noun combination, the synonyms representative of each sense are retrieved from WordNet (e.g., {great, large, big} vs. {great, neat, good}).</S>
			<S sid ="485" ssid = "50">Queries are submitted to AltaVista for each synonym-noun pair; the number of documents returned is used then as an estimate of how likely the different adjective senses are.</S>
			<S sid ="486" ssid = "51">Chao and Dyer obtain better results when prior knowledge is factored into their Bayesian network.</S>
			<S sid ="487" ssid = "52">67 Our work focuses on the ambiguity inherently present in Levin’s (1993) classification.</S>
			<S sid ="488" ssid = "53">The problem is ignored by Merlo and Stevenson (2001), who focus only on monosemous verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="489" ssid = "54">Polysemous verbs are included in Schulte im Walde’s (2000) experiments: The clustering approach can go so far as to identify more than one class for a given verb without, however, providing information about its dominant class.</S>
			<S sid ="490" ssid = "55">We recast Levin’s classification in a statistical framework and show in agreement with Merlo and Stevenson and Schulte im Walde that corpus-based distributions provide important information for semantic classification, especially in the case of polysemous verbs whose meaning cannot be easily inferred from the immediate surrounding context (i.e., subcategorization).</S>
			<S sid ="491" ssid = "56">We additionally show that the derived model is useful not only for determining the most likely overall class for a given verb (i.e., across the corpus), but also for disambiguating polysemous verb tokens in context.</S>
			<S sid ="492" ssid = "57">Like Schulte im Walde (2000), our approach relies on subcategorization frames extracted from the BNC (although using a different methodology).</S>
			<S sid ="493" ssid = "58">We employ Levin’s inventory of semantic classes, arriving at a finer-grained classification than Merlo and Stevenson (2001).</S>
			<S sid ="494" ssid = "59">In contrast to Schulte im Walde, we do not attempt to discover Levin classes from corpora; instead, we exploit Levin’s classification and corpus frequencies in order to derive a distribution of verbs, classes, and their frames that is not known a priori but is approximated using simplifications.</S>
			<S sid ="495" ssid = "60">Our approach is not particularly tied to Levin’s exact classification.</S>
			<S sid ="496" ssid = "61">We have presented in this article a general framework that could be extended to related classifications such as the semantic hierarchy proposed by Dang et al.</S>
			<S sid ="497" ssid = "62">(1998).</S>
			<S sid ="498" ssid = "63">In fact the latter may be more appropriate than Levin’s original classification for our disambiguation experiments, as it is based on a tighter correspondence between syntactic frames and semantic components and contains links to the WordNet taxonomy.</S>
			<S sid ="499" ssid = "64">Prior knowledge with regard to the likelihood of polysemous verb classes is acquired automatically in an unsupervised manner by combining corpus frequencies estimated from the BNC and information inherent in Levin.</S>
			<S sid ="500" ssid = "65">The models proposed by Chao and Dyer (2000) and Ciaramita and Johnson (2000) are not directly applicable to Levin’s classification, as the latter is not a hierarchy (and therefore not a DAG) and cannot be straightforwardly mapped into a Bayesian network.</S>
			<S sid ="501" ssid = "66">However, in agreement with Chao and Dyer and Ciaramita and Johnson, we show that prior knowledge about class preferences improves word sense disambiguation performance.</S>
			<S sid ="502" ssid = "67">Unlike Schulte im Walde (2000) and Merlo and Stevenson (2001), we ignore information about the arguments of a given verb in the form of either selectional restrictions or argument structure while building our prior models.</S>
			<S sid ="503" ssid = "68">The latter information is, however, indirectly taken into account in our disambiguation experiments: The verbs’ arguments are features for our naive Bayesian classifiers.</S>
			<S sid ="504" ssid = "69">Such information can be also incorporated into the prior model in the form of conditional probabilities, where the verb is, for example, conditioned on the thematic role of its arguments if this is known (see Gildea and Jurafsky [2000] for a method that automatically labels thematic roles).</S>
			<S sid ="505" ssid = "70">Unlike Stevenson and Merlo, Schulte im Walde, and Dorr and Jones (1996), we provide a general probabilistic model that assigns a probability to each class of a given verb by calculating the probability of a complex expression in terms of the probability of simpler expressions that compose it.</S>
			<S sid ="506" ssid = "71">We further show that this model is useful for disambiguating polysemous verbs in context.</S>
			<S sid ="507" ssid = "72">Appendix: Disambiguation Results with Co-occurrences Figures 6–9 show the performances of our naive Bayesian classifier when co-occurrences are used as features.</S>
			<S sid ="508" ssid = "73">We experimented with four types of context: left context (Left), 68 right context (Right), sentential context (Sentence), and the sentence within which the ambiguous verb is found together with its immediately preceding sentence (PSentence).</S>
			<S sid ="509" ssid = "74">The context was encoded as lemmas or parts of speech.</S>
