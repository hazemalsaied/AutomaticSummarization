			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">The task of Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT) is suggested by the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) project (NIST, 2003).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">The goal is to detect all entities in a given text and track all mentions that refer to the same entity.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">The task is a fundamental to many Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) applications, such as informa tion retrieval and extraction, text classification, summarization, question answering, and machine translation.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">EDT is an extension of the task of coreference resolution in that in EDT we not only resolve the coreference between mentions but also detect the entities.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Each of those entities may have one or more mentions.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">In the ACE project, there are five types of entities defined in EDT: person (PER), geography political Entity (GPE), organization (ORG), location (LOC), and facility (FAC).</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Many traditional coreference techniques can be extended to EDT for entity tracking.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Early work on pronoun anaphora resolution usually uses rule-based methods (e.g. Hobbs 1976; Ge et al., 1998; Mitkov, 1998), which try to mine the cues of the relation between the pronouns and its antecedents.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Recent research (Soon et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2003; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Ittycherah et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2004) focuses on the use of statistical machine learning methods and tries to resolve references among all kinds of noun phases, including name,nominal and pronoun phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">One common ap proach applied by them is to first train a binary statistical model to measure how likely a pair of * This work is done while the first author is visiting Microsoft Research Asia.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">mentions corefer; and then followed by a greedy procedure to group the mentions into entities.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Mention detection is to find all the named entity, noun or noun phrase, pronoun or pronoun phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Therefore, it needs Named Entity Rec ognition, but not only.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Though the detection of entity mentions is an essential problem for EDT/coreference, there has been relatively less previous research.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">Ng and Cardie (2002) shows that improving the recall of noun phrase identification can improve the performance of a coreference system.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">Florian et al.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">(2004) formulate the mention detection problem as a character-based classification problem.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">They assign for each character in the text a label, indicating whether it is the start of a specific mention, inside a specific mention, or outside of any mention.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">In this paper, we propose a unified EDT model based on the Transformation Based Learning (TBL, Brill, 1995) framework for Chinese.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">The model consists of two sub models: a mention detection model and a coreference model.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">The first sub-model is used to adapt existing Chinese word segmentation and Named Entity (NE) recognition system to a specific EDT standard.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">TBL is a widely used machine learning method, but it is the first time it is applied to coreference resolution.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">In addition, a feedback technique is proposed to further improve the performance of the system.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">The rest of the paper is organized as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">Raw Document MSRSeg&amp;POS Tagging Seg/POS/NE Document Coreference Model Mentions Entities Mention Detection Model In section 2, we propose the unified TBL Chinese EDT model framework.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">We describe the four key techniques of our Chinese EDT, the word segmentation adaptation model, the mention detection model, the coreference model and the feedback technique in section 3, 4, 5 and 6 accordingly.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">The experimental results on the ACE Chinese EDT corpus are shown in section 7.</S>

	<SECTION title="The Unified System Framework. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "1">Our Chinese EDT system consists of two components, mention detection module and coreference module besides a feedback technique between them as illustrated in Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "2">MSRSeg (Gao et al., 2003; Gao et al.), Microsoft Research Asia’s Chinese word segmen tation system that is integrated with named entity recognition, is used to segment Chinese words.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "3">However MSRSeg can’t well match the standard of ACE EDT evaluation for either types or boundaries.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "4">The difference of the standard of named entity between MSRSeg and ACE cause more than half of the errors for NAME mention detection.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "5">In order to overcome these problems, we integrate a segmentation adapter to mention detection model.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "6">The EDT system is a unified system that uses the TBL scheme.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "7">The idea of TBL is to learn a list of ordered rules while progressively improve upon the current state of the training set.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "8">An initial assignment is made based on simple statistics, and then rules are greedily learned to correct the mistakes, until no more improvement can be made.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "9">There are three main problems in the TBL framework: An initial state assignment, a set of allowable templates for rules, and an objective function for learning.</S>

	<SECTION title="Word Segmentation Adaptation. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "1">The method of applying TBL to adapt the Chinese word segmentation standard has been described in Gao et al.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "2">(2004).</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "3">Our approach is slightly different for not have a correctly segmented corpus according to ACE standard.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "4">From the un-segmented ACE EDT corpus, we can only obtain mention boundary information.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "5">So the adapting objective is to detect the mention boundary instead of all words in text, correctly.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "6">In the corpus, very few mentions’ boundaries are crossing1.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "7">The initial state of the segmentation adaptation model is the output of MSRSeg.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "8">And we 1 The mentions’ extents are frequently crossing, while.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "9">heads not.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "10">define two actions in the model, inserting and removing a boundary.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "11">The prefix or suffix of current word is used to define the boundary of inserting.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "12">Both inserting and removing action consider the combination of POS tag and word string of current, left and right words.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "13">When inserting a boundary, the right part of the word keeps the old POS tag, and the left part introduces a special POS tag “new”.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "14">When removing a boundary, the new formed word introduces a special POS tag “new”.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "15">The following two examples illustrate the strategy.</S>

	<SECTION title="Mention Detection. " number = "4">
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "1">Since the word segmentation adaptation model has corrected the boundaries of mentions, our mention detection model bases on word and only tagging the entity mention types.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "2">The model detects the mentions by tagging sixteen tags (including the combination of five entity types and three mention types and “OTHER” tag) for all the words outputted by segmentation adaptation model.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "3">The templates, as illustrated in table 1, only refer to local features, such as POS tag and word string of left, right, and current words; the suffix, and single character feature of current word.</S>

	<SECTION title="Entity Tracking. " number = "5">
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "1">In our entity tracking/coreference model, the initial state is let each mention in a document form an entity, as shown in Figure 2 (a).</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "2">And the objective function directs the learning process to insert or remove chains between mentions (Figure 2 b and c) to approach the goal state (Figure 2 f).</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "3">A list of rules is learned in greedy fashion, according to the objective function.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "4">When no rule that improves the current state of the train ing set beyond a preset threshold can be found, the training phrase ends.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "5">The objective function in our system is driven by the correctness of the binary classification for pairwise mention pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "6">The TBL entity tracking model has more widely clustering/searching space as compare with previous strategies (Soon et al. 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Luo et al., 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "7">For example, the state shown in Figure 2 (d) is not reachable for them.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "8">Because they assume one mention should refer to its most confidential mentions or entities that before it, while A and B are obviously not in same entity, as we can see in Figure 2 (d).</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "9">Thus C can refer to either A or B, but not both.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "10">While in TBL model, this state is allowed.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "11">In order to keep our system robust, the transformation templates refer to only six types of simple features, as described below.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "12">All these features do not need any high level tools (i.e. syntactic parser) and little external knowledge base.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "13">In fact, only a country name abbreviation list (171 entrances) and a Chinese province alias list (34 entrances) are used to detect “alias” relation for String Match feature.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "14">String Match feature (STRM): Its possible values are exact, alias, abbr, left, right, other.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "15">If two mentions are exact string matched, then re turn exact; else if one mention is an alias of the other, then return alias; else if one mention is the abbreviation of the other, then return abbr; else if one mention is the left substring of the other, then return left; else if one mention is the right substring of the other, then return right; else return other.</S>

			<S sid ="96" ssid = "23">Mention String (M): Its possible values are the actual mention string.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "24">These six features can be divided into two categories: mention pair features (the first three) and single mention features (the other three).</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "25">And the single mention features are suffixed with “L” or “R” to differentiate for left or right mentions (i.e. ETL represent the left mention’s entity type).</S>

			<S sid ="107" ssid = "1">There are three reasons push us apply feedback technique in the EDT system.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "2">The first is to determine whether a signal character is an abbreviation is discourse depended.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "3">For example, Chinese character “ 中 ” can represents both a country name “China” and a common preposition “in”.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "4">If it can links to “ 中 国/China” by coreference model, it is likely to represent “China”.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "5">The second is the definition of mentions is hard to hold, especially the nominal mentions.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "6">An isolated mention is more likely not to be a mention.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "7">The third is to pick up lost men tion according to its multi-appearance in the discourse.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "8">In fact, [Ji and Crishman, 2004] has used five hubristic rules based on coreference results to improve the name recognition result.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "9">While in this section we will present an automatic method.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "10">The feedback technique is employed by using entity features in mention detection model.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "11">In our model, the transformation templates refer to the number of mentions in the entity, the sin gle character feature, the entity type feature, the mention type feature and mention string, as listed follows.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "12">SDD: Its possible values are the combination of the mention type and entity type of the mention string in discourse: PER, GPE, ORG, LOC, FAC, NPER (NOMINAL PER), NGPE, NORG, NLOC, NFAC, PPER (PROUNOUN PER), PGPE, PORG, PLOC, and PFAC.</S>
