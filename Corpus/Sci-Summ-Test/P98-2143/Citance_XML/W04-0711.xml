			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">The need for identifying the antecedents of anaphoric expressions in the literature is well- recognized.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Most previous approaches assume that anaphoric expressions and their antecedents would appear in the same documents.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">However, further work is called for when such antecedents need to be associated with actual entities in the world, where the task of establishing the denotation of a named entity with respect to the world or a model is known as named entity grounding (Leidner et al., 2003).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">In the biomedical domain where the phrases in the literature tend to refer to actual biological entities such as proteins, the phrases should be associated with the actual entries of external resources (Hachey et al., 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">In this paper, we present a biomedical anaphora resolution system, BioAR, in order to identify the actual referents of those phrases in the biomedical literature and to annotate the phrases, especially those that refer to proteins, with the entries of proteome databases such as SwissProt by suitable anaphora resolution.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Anaphora resolution indicates the process of determining the antecedent of an anaphoric expression.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Traditional approaches to anaphora resolution in general domain utilize various constraints or preferences from the morphological, syntactic, and semantic points of view.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">The most prominent proposal for anaphora resolution is a centering theory (Grosz et al.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">(1995)), which identifies the antecedents of pronouns with respect to discourse structures, based on the observation that those entities that have already been mentioned and are more central than others tend to be referred back by pronouns subsequently.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Byron (2002) proposed to identify the antecedents of pronominal references in spoken dialogues by utilizing discourse structures with discourse entities and semantic filtering.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Castano et al.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">(2002) adopted a knowledge- poor method, which focuses on resolving pronouns robustly, for example with part-of-speech information, positions of the candidate antecedents, agree(1) The yeast and mammalian branchpoint se quence binding proteins (BBP and mBBP/ SF1) contain both KH domain and Zn knuckle RNA-binding motifs.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Therefore, we propose that all three of these accessory RNA-binding modules bind the phosphate backbone, whereas the KH domain interacts specifically with the bases of the BPS.</S>

			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">(1998)).</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">In the biomedical literature, an anaphoric expression works as the device of making an abbreviated and indirect reference to some biological object or objects.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">This notion can be applied to all the phrases in the literature which refer to proteins, in that the phrases can be associated (or grounded) with the protein entries in proteome databases, which biologists generally regard as the identities of proteins.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">The protein-referring phrases in the literature include not only gene/protein names but also anaphoric expressions and missing arguments of biological interactions (or null anaphors) which refer to proteins.1 As for anaphoric expressions, previous approaches to anaphora resolution often stop at antecedent noun phrases in the same documents, but we propose to further identify the proteins that are composed of protein domains referred to by anaphoric expressions.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">For example, the anaphoric expression the KH domain in the last sentence in Table 1 refers to the domain shared by the proteins “the yeast and mammalian branchpoint sequence binding proteins (BBP and mBBP/SF1).”2 While previous approaches have dealt only with the resolution of pronouns (e.g. it, they) and sortal 1 As for anaphora resolution, there are three related kinds of objects in biomedical domain, that is, pronouns, antecedents, and real entities in the world, where pronouns and antecedents are the phrases in the literature.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Among antecedents, there can be “anaphoric” ones, referring to other antecedents.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">Both pronouns and antecedents eventually refer to real entities in the world, so the protein-referring phrases in the literature include both pronouns and antecedents in the literature.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">2 Hereafter, the italicized string is an anaphoric expression and the underlined string is its antecedent.</S>

			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">We also used the yeast two-hybrid system to clarify that this interaction requires the top half of the tail domain (amino acid 384566) of lamin A.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">(PMID:11173535) Table 2: Missing argument examples of biological interactions anaphoric noun phrases (e.g. the protein, both enzymes), we can also restore the missing arguments of the biological interactions, mostly represented with nominal interaction keywords such as interaction with or without determiners, by utilizing the context (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">Hong and Park (2004)).</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">For example, the omitted argument of interaction in the first example in Table 2 is the sentential subject, or “MOB1.” In the second example in Table 2, the two omitted participants of the interaction represented by the anaphoric expression this interaction are “lamin A” and “emerin,” which are also the syntactic arguments of the verb binds.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">In this paper, we present a biomedical anaphora resolution system, BioAR, to ground the protein- referring phrases in the biological interactions extracted by our biomedical information extraction system, BioIE (Kim and Park, 2004; Park et al., 2001), with SwissProt entries.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">BioIE is a system that extracts general biological interactions of arbitrary types from the biomedical literature.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">This system shows the performance of 88 92% precision and 55 57% recall, or the F-scores of 68 70.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">While the output of BioIE includes complex linguistic phenomena, such as anaphoric expressions, conjunctions, prepositional phrases, and relative clauses, many of the noun phrases in the results of BioIE refer to proteins since the relevant interaction keywords, such as interact and bind, mostly represent protein-protein interactions Anaphoric expression Count Pronouns 53 Anaphoric DNPs 26 Missing arguments 8 Table 3: Statistics of anaphoric expressions and the interactions among them.3 BioAR grounds those protein-referring phrases with SwissProt entries which work as the protein nodes in the protein pathways that can be automatically built by incorporating the biological interactions extracted by BioIE.</S>

			<S sid ="40" ssid = "2">The system first locates pronouns, noun phrases with determiners (DNPs), and biological interactions as the candidates of anaphoric expressions.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "3">Table 3 shows the statistics of these anaphoric expressions.4 The rest of the system is implemented in the following four steps: 1) pronoun resolution, 2) resolution of anaphoric DNPs, 3) restoration of missing arguments in the biological interactions, and 4) grounding the protein-referring phrases with SwissProt entries.</S>

			<S sid ="43" ssid = "5">We adopt the centering theory of Grosz et al.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "6">(1995) for the anaphora resolution of pronouns.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "7">In particular, we follow the observation that the entities which have already been mentioned and are more central than others tend to be referred back by pronouns subsequently.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "8">For example, the candidate antecedent in the sentential subject is preferred to that in the sentential object (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "9">Table 4).</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "10">As for possessive pronouns such as its and their, we have found that the antecedents of these possessive pronouns are mostly located in the same or preceding sentences and that possessive pronouns can be classified into the following two types according to the sentential locations of their antecedents, 3 There are 232 noun phrases which can be associated with SwissProt entries, among 1,645 noun phrases in 516 biological interactions extracted by BioIE from a subset of yeast corpus.</S>

			<S sid ="52" ssid = "14">Table 5).</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "15">We have also found that the local context of a possessive pronoun of the second type mostly shows syntactic parallelism with that of its antecedent, as in the two they of the second example in Table 5, while that of the first type does not show parallelism where the antecedents of such possessive pronouns are mostly the protein names nearest to the left of the possessive pronouns.5 Since the antecedents of possessive pronouns of the second type can be detected with the patterns that encode the parallelism between the local context of a possessive pronoun and that of its antecedent in the same sentence (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "16">Table 6),6 we have set the protein names, those nearest to the left of the possessive pronouns in the same sentences, as the default antecedents of possessive pronouns and utilized the patterns, such as those in Table 6, in recognizing the possessive pronouns of the second type and in locating their antecedents.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "17">2.2 Noun phrase resolution.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "18">In the process of resolving anaphoric noun phrases, BioAR first locates the noun phrases with determiners (DNPs), especially those with definites (i.e. the) and demonstratives (i.e. this, these, and those), as 5 Among the 1,000 biological interactions, there are 31 possessive pronouns of the first type and 17 possessive pronouns of the second type.</S>

			<S sid ="190" ssid = "1">BioAR identifies the antecedents of anaphoric noun phrases that appear in the results of BioIE.</S>
			<S sid ="191" ssid = "2">The system further identifies the proteins which contain the domains referred to by anaphoric expressions by utilizing several patterns which describe their relations.</S>
			<S sid ="192" ssid = "3">The system also identifies the missing arguments of biological interactions by utilizing biological interaction patterns.</S>
			<S sid ="193" ssid = "4">Finally, the system grounds the protein-referring phrases with the most relevant SwissProt entries by consulting the species information of the proteins.</S>
			<S sid ="194" ssid = "5">We believe that anaphora resolution with database entries may not be addressed in other domains as straightforwardly as in this paper, since there are quite few comprehensive resources with actual entities.</S>
			<S sid ="195" ssid = "6">The task of grounding the protein-referring phrases in the results of BioIE with SwissProt entries is crucial to building up incorporated protein pathways consisting of the biological interactions extracted by BioIE.</S>
			<S sid ="196" ssid = "7">We are currently working on integrating BioIE, BioAR, and other systems for on- tology manipulation and information visualization for synergistic knowledge discovery.</S>
