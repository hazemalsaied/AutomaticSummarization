Abstract
The paper aims at a deeper understanding of sev- 
eral well-known algorithms and proposes ways to 
optimize them.  It describes and discusses factors 
and strategies of factor interaction used in the algo- 
rithms. The factors used in the algorithms and the 
algorithms themselves are evaluated on a German 
corpus annotated with syntactic and coreference in- 
formation (Negra) (Skut et al., 1997).  A common 
format for pronoun resolution algorithms with sev- 
eral open parameters is proposed, and the parameter 
settings optimal on the evaluation data are given.

1   Introduction
In recent years, a variety of approaches to pronoun 
resolution have been proposed.  Some of them are 
based on centering theory (Strube, 1998; Strube and 
Hahn, 1999; Tetreault, 2001), others on Machine 
Learning (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Ge et al., 1998; 
Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Yang et al.,
2003). They supplement older heuristic approaches 
(Hobbs, 1978; Lappin and Leass, 1994).  Unfortu- 
nately, most of these approaches were evaluated on
different corpora making different assumptions so
that direct comparison is not possible. Appreciation 
of the new insights is quite hard. Evaluation differs 
not only with regard to size and genre of corpora but 
also along the following lines.
Scope of application:   Some approaches only deal 
with personal and possessive pronouns (centering 
and heuristic), while others consider coreference 
links in general (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie,
2002; Yang et al., 2003).  A drawback of this lat- 
ter view is that it mixes problems on different lev-
els of difficulty.  It remains unclear how much of
the success is due to the virtues of the approach and 
how much is due to the distribution of hard and easy 
problems in the corpus. In this paper, we will only 
deal with coreferential pronouns (i.e.   possessive, 
demonstrative, and third person pronouns).

Quality of linguistic input:   Some proposals were 
evaluated on  hand  annotated (Strube and  Hahn,
1999) or tree bank input (Ge et al., 1998; Tetreault,
2001).  Other proposals provide a more realistic 
picture in that they work as a backend to a parser
(Lappin and Leass, 1994) or noun chunker (Mitkov,
1998; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002)). In 
evaluation of applications presupposing parsing, it 
is helpful to separate errors due to parsing from in- 
trinsic errors.  On the other hand, one would also 
like to gauge the end-to-end performance of a sys- 
tem. Thus we will provide performance figures for 
both ideal (hand-annotated) input and realistic (au- 
tomatically generated) input.

Language:   Most approaches were evaluated on 
English where large resources are available, both 
in terms of pre-annotated data (MUC-6 and MUC-7 
data) and lexical information (WordNet). This paper 
deals with German. Arguably, the free word-order 
of German arguably leads to a clearer distinction be- 
tween grammatical function, surface order, and in- 
formation status (Strube and Hahn, 1999).
  The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 de- 
scribes the evaluation corpus.  Section 3 describes 
several factors relevant to pronoun resolution. It as- 
sesses these factors against the corpus, measuring 
their precision and restrictiveness.  Section 4 de- 
scribes and evaluates six algorithms on the basis of 
these factors. It also captures the algorithms as para- 
metric systems and proposes parameter settings op- 
timal on the evaluation data. Section 5 concludes.

2   Evaluation Corpus

We chose as an evaluation base the NEGRA tree 
bank, which contains about 350,000 tokens of Ger- 
man newspaper text. The same corpus was also pro- 
cessed with a finite-state parser, performing at 80% 
dependency f-score (Schiehlen, 2003).
  All personal pronouns (PPER), possessive pro- 
nouns (PPOSAT), and demonstrative pronouns 
(PDS) in Negra were annotated in a format geared 
to the MUC-7 guidelines (MUC-7, 1997).  Proper


names were annotated automatically by a named 
entity recognizer.  In a small portion of the corpus 
(6.7%), all coreference links were annotated. Thus 
the size of the annotated data (3,115 personal pro- 
nouns1 , 2,198 possessive pronouns, 928 demonstra- 
tive pronouns) compares favourably with the size of 
evaluation data in other proposals (619 German pro- 
nouns in (Strube and Hahn, 1999), 2,477 English 
pronouns in (Ge et al., 1998), about 5,400 English 
coreferential expressions in (Ng and Cardie, 2002)).
  In the experiments, systems only looked for sin- 
gle NP antecedents. Hence, propositional or pred- 
icative antecedents (8.4% of the pronouns anno- 
tated) and split antecedents (0.2%) were inaccessi- 
ble, which reduced optimal success rate to 91.4%.

3   Factors in Pronoun Resolution

Pronoun resolution is conditioned by a wide range 
of factors. Two questions arise: Which factors are 
the most effective? How is interaction of the factors 
modelled?  The present section deals with the first 
question, while the second question is postponed to 
section 4.
  Many approaches distinguish two classes of res- 
olution factors: filters and preferences.  Filters ex- 
press linguistic rules, while preferences are merely 
tendencies in interpretation.  Logically, filters are 
monotonic inferences that select a certain subset 
of possible antecedents, while preferences are non- 
monotonic inferences that partition the set of an- 
tecedents and impose an order on the cells.
  In the sequel, factors proposed in the literature are 
discussed and their value is appraised on evaluation 
data.  Every factor narrows the set of antecedents 
and potentially discards correct antecedents.   Ta- 
ble 1 lists both the success rate maximally achiev- 
able (broken down according to different types of 
pronouns) and the average number of antecedents 
remaining after applying each factor.  Figures are 
also given for parsed input. Preferences are evalu- 
ated on filtered sets of antecedents.

3.1   Filters
Agreement.   An important filter comes from mor- 
phology: Agreement in gender and number is gener- 
ally regarded as a prerequisite for coreference. Ex- 
ceptions are existant but few (2.5%): abstract pro- 
nouns (such as that in English) referring to non- 
neuter or plural NPs, plural pronouns co-referring 
with singular collective NPs (Ge et al., 1998), an- 
tecedent and anaphor matching in natural gender

  1 Here, we only count anaphoric pronouns, i.e. third person 
pronouns not used expletively.


rather than grammatical gender.  All in all, a max- 
imal performance of 88.9% is maintained. The fil- 
ter is very restrictive, and cuts the set of possible 
antecedents in half. See Table 1 for details.
Binding.  Binding constraints have been in the 
focus of linguistic research for more than thirty 
years.  They provide restrictions on co-indexation 
of pronouns with clause siblings, and therefore can 
only be applied with systems that determine clause 
boundaries, i.e.  parsers (Mitkov, 1998).  Empiri- 
cally, binding constraints are rules without excep- 
tions, hence they do not lead to any loss in achiev- 
able performance. The downside is that their restric- 
tive power is quite bad as well (0.3% in our corpus, 
cf. Table 1).
Sortal Constraints.   More controversial are sor- 
tal constraints. Intuitively, they also provide a hard 
filter: The correct antecedent must fit into the en- 
vironment of the pronoun (Carbonell and Brown,
1988). In general, however, the required knowledge 
sources are lacking, so they must be hand-coded and 
can only be applied in restricted domains (Strube 
and Hahn, 1999).  Selectional restrictions can also 
be modelled by collocational data extracted by a 
parser, which have, however, only a very small im- 
pact on overall performance (Kehler et al., 2004). 
We will neglect sortal constraints in this paper.

3.2   Preferences
Preferences can be classified according to their re- 
quirements on linguistic processing. Sentence Re- 
cency and Surface Order can be read directly off the 
surface.  NP Form presupposes at least tagging. A 
range of preferences (Grammatical Roles, Role Par- 
allelism, Depth of Embedding, Common Path), as 
well as all filters, presuppose full syntactic analysis. 
Mention Count and Information Status are based on 
previous decisions of the anaphora resolution mod- 
ule.
Sentence Recency (SR).   The most important cri- 
terion in pronoun resolution (Lappin and Leass,
1994) is the textual distance between anaphor and 
antecedent measured in sentences. Lappin and Le-
ass (1994) motivate this preference as a dynamic ex- 
pression of the attentional state of the human hearer:
Memory capability for storage of discourse refer-
ents degrades rapidly.
  Several implementations are possible.   Perhaps 
most  obvious  is  the  strategy  implicit in  Lappin 
and Leass (1994)’s algorithm:  The antecedent is
searched in a sentence that is as recent as possi-
ble, beginning with the already uttered part of the 
current sentence, continuing in the last sentence, in 
the one but last sentence, and so forth.  In case no

also comes at a cost: The upper ceiling of perfor-

Figure 1 shows the absolute frequencies of sen-
tence recency values when only the most recent an- 
tecedent (in the order just stated) is considered. In 
Negra, 55.3% of all pronominal anaphora can be re- 
solved intrasententially, and 97.6% within the last 
three sentences.  Since only 1.6% of all pronouns 
are cataphoric, it seems reasonable to neglect cat- 
aphora, as is mostly done (Strube and Hahn, 1999; 
Hobbs, 1978).  Table 1 underscores the virtues of 
Sentence Recency: In the most recent sentence with 
antecedents satisfying the filters, there are on aver-


ble. In Negra, this ordering imposes an upper limit 
of 51.2%.

Grammatical Roles (GR).  Another important 
factor in pronoun resolution is the grammatical role 
of the antecedent. The role hierarchy used in cen- 
tering (Brennan et al., 1987; Grosz et al., 1995) 
ranks subjects over direct objects over indirect ob- 
jects over others. Lappin and Leass (1994) provide a 
more elaborate model which ranks NP complements 
and NP adjuncts lowest.  Two other distinctions in


their model express a preference of rhematic2 over 
thematic arguments: Existential subjects, which fol- 
low the verb, rank very high, between subjects and 
direct objects.  Topic adjuncts in pre-subject posi- 
tion separated by a comma rank very low, between 
adjuncts and NP complements. Both positions are 
not clearly demarcated in German. When the Lap- 
pin&Leass hierarchy is adopted to German with- 
out changes, a small drop in performance results 
as compared with the obliqueness hierarchy used in 
centering.  So we will use the centering hierarchy. 
Table 1 shows the effect of the role-based prefer- 
ence on our data. The factor is both less restrictive 
and less precise than sentence recency.
  The definition of a grammatical role hierarchy is 
more involved in case of automatically derived in- 
put, as the parser cannot always decide on the gram- 
matical role (determining grammatical roles in Ger- 
man may require world knowledge). It proposes a 
syntactically preferred role, however, which we will 
adopt.

Role Parallelism (RP).  Carbonell and Brown 
(1988) argue that pronouns prefer antecedents in the 
same grammatical roles.  Lappin and Leass (1994) 
also adopt such a principle. The factor is, however, 
not applicable to possessive pronouns.
  Again, role ambiguities make this factor slightly 
problematic.  Several approaches are conceivable: 
Antecedent and pronoun are required to have a com- 
mon role in one reading (weak match). Antecedent 
and pronoun are required to have the same role 
in the reading preferred by surface order (strong 
match).    Antecedent and  pronoun  must  display 
the same role ambiguity (strongest match).  Weak 
match restricted performance to 49.9% with 12.1 
antecedents on average. Strong match gave an up- 
per limit of 47.0% but with only 10.3 antecedents on 
average. Strongest match lowered the upper limit to
43.1% but yielded only 9.3 antecedents. In interac- 
tion, strong match performed best, so we adopt it.

Surface Order (LR, RL).   Surface Order is usu- 
ally used to bring down the number of available 
antecedents to one, since it is the only factor that 
produces a unique discourse referent. There is less 
consensus on the preference order: (sentence-wise) 
left-to-right (Hobbs, 1978;  Strube, 1998;  Strube 
and Hahn, 1999; Tetreault, 1999) or right-to-left 
(recency) (Lappin and Leass, 1994).  Furthermore, 
something has to be said about antecedents which 
embed other antecedents (e.g.  conjoined NPs and 
their conjuncts).  We registered performance gains

  2 Carbonell and Brown (1988) also argue that clefted or 
fronted arguments should be preferred.


(of up to 3%) by ranking embedding antecedents 
higher than embedded ones (Tetreault, 2001).
  Left-to-right order is often used as a surrogate for 
grammatical role hierarchy in English.  The most 
notable exception to this equivalence are fronting 
constructions, where grammatical roles outperform 
surface order (Tetreault, 2001). A comparison of the 
lines for grammatical roles and for surface order in 
Table 1 shows that the same is true in German.
Left-to-right order performs better (upper limit
56.8%) than right-to-left order (upper limit 49.2%). 
The gain is largely due to personal pronouns; 
demonstrative pronouns are better modelled by 
right-to-left order.   It is well-known that German 
demonstrative pronouns contrast with personal pro- 
nouns in that they function as topic-shifting devices. 
Another effect of this phenomenon is the poor per- 
formance of the role preferences in connection with 
demonstrative pronouns.

Depth of Embedding (DE).   A prominent factor 
in Hobbs (1978)’s algorithm is the level of phrasal 
embedding: Hobbs’s algorithm performs a breadth- 
first search, so antecedents at higher levels of em- 
bedding are preferred.

Common Path (CP).  The syntactic version of 
Hobbs (1978)’s algorithm also assumes maximiza- 
tion of the common path between antecedents and 
anaphors as measured in NP and S nodes. Accord- 
ingly, intra-sentential antecedents that are syntacti- 
cally nearer to the pronoun are preferred. The factor 
only applies to intrasentential anaphora.
  The anaphora resolution module itself generates 
potentially useful information when processing a 
text. Arguably, discourse entities that have been of- 
ten referred to in the previous context are topical 
and more likely to serve as antecedents again. This 
principle can be captured in different ways.

Equivalence Classes (EQ).  Lappin and Leass 
(1994) make use of a mechanism based on equiva- 
lence classes of discourse referents which manages 
the attentional properties of the individual entities 
referred to. The mechanism stores and provides in- 
formation on how recently and in which grammat- 
ical role the entities were realized in the discourse. 
The net effect of the storage mechanism is that dis- 
course entities are preferred as antecedents if they 
recently came up in the discourse. But the mecha- 
nism also integrates the preferences Role Hierarchy 
and Role Parallelism. Hence, it is one of the best- 
performing factors on our data.  Since the equiva- 
lence class scheme is tightly integrated in the parser, 
the problem of ideal anaphora resolution data does 
not arise.


Mention Count (MC).   Ge et al. (1998) try to fac- 
torize the same principle by counting the number of 
times a discourse entities has been mentioned in the 
discourse already. However, they do not only train 
but also test on the manually annotated counts, and 
hence presuppose an optimal anaphora resolution 
system.  In our implementation, we did not bother 
with intrasentential mention count, which depends 
on the exact traversal.  Rather, mention count was 
computed only from previous sentences.

Information Status (IS).  Strube (1998) and 
Strube and Hahn (1999) argue that the informa- 
tion status of an antecedent is more important than 
the grammatical role in which it occurs. They dis- 
tinguish three levels of information status: entities 
known to the hearer (as expressed by coreferential 
NPs, unmodified proper names, appositions, rela- 
tive pronouns, and NPs in titles), entities related to 
such hearer-old entities (either overtly via modifiers 
or by bridging), and entities new to the hearer. Like 
(Ge et al., 1998), Strube (1998) evaluates on ideal 
hand annotated data.

NP Form (NF, NP).   A cheap way to model in- 
formation status is to consider the form of an an- 
tecedent (Tetreault, 2001; Soon et al., 2001; Strube 
and Müller, 2003).   Personal and demonstrative 
pronouns are necessarily context-dependent, and 
proper nouns are nearly always known to the hearer. 
Definite NPs may be coreferential or interpreted by 
bridging, while indefinite NPs are in their vast ma- 
jority new to the hearer. We considered two propos- 
als for orderings of form: preferring pronouns and 
proper names over other NPs over indefinite NPs 
(Tetreault, 2001) (NF) or preferring pronouns over 
all other NPs (Tetreault, 2001) (NP).

4   Algorithms and Evaluation

In this section, we consider the individual ap- 
proaches in more detail, in particular we will look 
at their choice of factors and their strategy to model 
factor interaction.  According to interaction poten- 
tial, we distinguish three classes of approaches: Se- 
rialization, Weighting, and Machine Learning.
  We re-implemented some of the algorithms de- 
scribed in the literature and evaluated them on syn- 
tactically ideal and realistic German3 input. Evalu- 
ation results are listed in Table 2.
  With the ideal treebank input, we also assumed 
ideal input for the factors dependent on previous

  3 A reviewer points out that most of the algorithms were pro- 
posed for English, where they most likely perform better. How- 
ever, the algorithms also incorporate a theory of saliency, which 
should be language-independent.


anaphora resolution results.  With realistic parsed 
input, we fed the results of the actual system back 
into the computation of such factors.

4.1   Serialization Approaches
Algorithmical approaches first apply filters uncon- 
ditionally; possible exceptions are deemed non- 
existant or negligible.   With regard to interaction 
of preferences, many algorithms (Hobbs, 1978; 
Strube, 1998; Tetreault, 2001) subscribe to a 
scheme, which, though completely rigid, performs 
surprisingly well:  The chosen preferences are ap- 
plied one after the other in a certain pre-defined or- 
der. Application of a preference consists in select- 
ing those of the antecedents still available that are 
ranked highest in the preference order.
  Hobbs (1978)’s algorithm essentially is a con- 
catenation of the preferences Sentence Recency 
(without cataphora), Common Path, Depth of Em- 
bedding, and left-to-right Surface Order. It also im- 
plements the binding constraints by disallowing sib- 
ling to the anaphor in a clause or NP as antecedents. 
Like Lappin and Leass (1994), we replaced this im- 
plementation by our own mechanism to check bind- 
ing constraints, which raised the success rate.
  The Left-Right Centering algorithm of Tetreault 
(1999) is similar to Hobbs’s algorithm, and is com- 
posed of the preferences Sentence Recency (without 
cataphora), Depth of Embedding, and left-to-right 
Surface Order.  Since it is a centering approach, it 
only inspects the current and last sentence.
  Strube (1998)’s S-list algorithm is also restricted 
to the current and last sentence.  Predicative com- 
plements and NPs in direct speech are excluded 
as antecedents.  The primary ordering criterion is 
Information Status, followed by Sentence Recency 
(without cataphora) and left-to-right Surface Order.
  Since serialization provides a quite rigid frame, 
we conducted an experiment to find the best per- 
forming combination of pronoun resolution factors 
on the treebank and the best combination on the 
parsed input. For this purpose, we checked all per- 
mutations of preferences and subtracted preferences 
from the best-performing combinations until perfor- 
mance degraded (greedy descent). Greedy descent 
outperformed hill-climbing. The completely anno- 
tated 6.7% of the corpus were used as development 
set, the rest as test set.

4.2   Weighting Approaches
Compared with the serialization approaches, the al- 
gorithm of Lappin and Leass (1994) is more sophis- 
ticated: It uses a system of hand-selected weights 
to control interaction among preferences, so that 
in principle the order of preference application can

switch under different input data. In the actual real- 
ization, however, the weights of factors lie so much 
apart that in the majority of cases interaction boils 
down to serialization.  The weighting scheme in- 
cludes Sentence Recency, Grammatical Roles, Role 
Parallelism, on the basis of the equivalence class ap- 
proach described in section 3.2. Final choice of an- 
tecedents is relegated to right-to-left Surface Order.
  Interestingly, the Lappin&Leass algorithm out- 
performs even the best serialization algorithm on 
parsed input.

4.3   Machine Learning Approaches

Machine Learning approaches (Ge et al., 1998; 
Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002) do not dis- 
tinguish between filters and preferences. They sub- 
mit all factors as features to the learner.  For every 
combination of feature values the learner has the 
freedom to choose different factors and to assign 
different strength to them.
  Thus the main problem is not choice and in- 
teraction of factors, but rather the formulation of 
anaphora resolution as a classification problem. 
Two proposals emerge from the literature. (1) Given 
an anaphor and an antecedent, decide if the an- 
tecedent is the correct one (Ge et al., 1998; Soon 
et al.,  2001;  Ng and Cardie,  2002).   (2) Given 
an anaphor and two antecedents, decide which an- 
tecedent is more likely to be the correct one (Yang 
et al., 2003).  In case (1), the lopsidedness of the 
distribution is problematic:  There are much more 
negative than positive training examples. Machine 
Learning tools have to surpass a very high baseline: 
The strategy of never proposing an antecedent typ- 
ically already yields an f-score of over 90%.   In 
case (2), many more correct decisions have to be 
made before a correct antecedent is found. Thus it is 
important in this scenario, that the set of antecedents 
is subjected to a strict filtering process in advance so


that the system only has to choose among the best 
candidates and errors are less dangerous.
  Ge et al.  (1998)’s probabilistic approach com- 
bines three factors (aside from the agreement filter): 
the result of the Hobbs algorithm, Mention Count 
dependent on the position of the sentence in the ar- 
ticle, and the probability of the antecedent occur- 
ring in the local context of the pronoun.   In our 
re-implementation, we neglected the last factor (see 
section 3.1).  Evaluation was performed using 10- 
fold cross validation.
Other Machine Learning approaches (Soon et al.,
2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Yang et al., 2003) make 
use of decision tree learning4 ; we used C4.5 (Quin- 
lan, 1993). To construct the training set, Soon et al. 
(2001) take the nearest correct antecedent in the pre- 
vious context as a positive example, while all pos- 
sible antecedents between this antecedent and the 
pronoun serve as negative examples.  For testing, 
potential antecedents are presented to the classifier 
in Right-to-Left order; the first one classified posi- 
tive is chosen. Apart from agreement, only two of 
Soon et al.  (2001)’s features apply to pronominal 
anaphora:  Sentence Recency, and NP Form (with
personal pronouns only). We used every 10th sen- 
tence in Negra for testing, all other sentences for 
training.  On parsed input, a very simple decision 
tree is generated:  For every personal and posses- 
sive pronoun, the nearest agreeing pronoun is cho- 
sen as antecedent; demonstrative pronouns never 
get an antecedent. This tree performs better than the 
more complicated tree generated from treebank in- 
put, where also non-pronouns in previous sentences 
can serve as antecedents to a personal pronoun.
  Soon et al. (2001)’s algorithm performs below its 
potential. We modified it somewhat to get better re- 
sults.  For one, we used every possible antecedent

  4 On our data, Maximum Entropy (Kehler et al., 2004) had 
problems with the high baseline, i.e. proposed no antecedents.


in the training set, which improved performance 
on the treebank set (by 1.8%) but degraded perfor- 
mance on the parsed data (by 2%). Furthermore, we 
used additional features, viz. the grammatical role 
of antecedent and pronoun, the NP form of the an- 
tecedent, and its information status. The latter two 
features were combined to a single feature with very 
many values, so that they were always chosen first in 
the decision tree. We also used fractional numbers 
to express intrasentential word distance in addition 
to Soon et al.  (2001)’s sentential distance.  Role 
Parallelism (Ng and Cardie, 2002) degraded perfor- 
mance (by 0.3% F-value).  Introducing agreement 
as a feature had no effect, since the learner always 
determined that mismatches in agreement preclude 
coreference. Mention Count, Depth of Embedding, 
and Common Path did not affect performance either.

5   Conclusion

The paper has presented a survey of pronoun reso- 
lution factors and algorithms. Two questions were 
investigated: Which factors should be chosen, and 
how should they interact?   Two types of factors,
‘filters’ and ‘preferences’, were discussed in detail. 
In particular, their restrictive potential and effect on 
success rate were assessed on the evaluation corpus. 
To address the second question, several well-known 
algorithms were grouped into three classes accord- 
ing to their solution to factor interaction: Serializa- 
tion, Weighting, and Machine Learning. Six algo- 
rithms were evaluated against a common evaluation 
set so as to facilitate direct comparison.  Different 
algorithms have different strengths, in particular as 
regards their robustness to parsing errors.  Two of 
the interaction strategies (Serialization and Machine 
Learning) allow data-driven optimization. Optimal 
algorithms could be proposed for these strategies.
