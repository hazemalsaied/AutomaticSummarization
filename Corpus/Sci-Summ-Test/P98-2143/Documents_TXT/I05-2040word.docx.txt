Abstract

This paper proposes a unified
Transformation Based Learning (TBL,
Brill, 1995) framework for Chinese 
Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT). 
It   consists   of   two   sub   models:   a
mention detection model and an entity
tracking/coreference model. The first 
sub-model is used to adapt existing 
Chinese word segmentation and Named 
Entity (NE) recognition results to a 
specific EDT standard to find all the 
mentions.  The  second  sub-model  is 
used to find the coreference relation 
between the mentions. In addition, a 
feedback technique is proposed to 
further improve the performance of the 
system. We evaluated our methods on 
the  Automatic  Content  Extraction 
(ACE, NIST, 2003) Chinese EDT 
corpus.  Results  show  that  it 
outperforms the baseline, and achieves 
comparable performance with the state- 
of-the-art methods.


1	Introduction

The task of Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT) 
is suggested by the Automatic Content Extrac- 
tion (ACE) project (NIST, 2003). The goal is to
detect all entities in a given text and track all
mentions that refer to the same entity. The task
is  a  fundamental  to  many  Natural  Language
Processing (NLP) applications, such as informa-
tion retrieval and extraction, text classification,
summarization, question answering, and ma- 
chine translation.
   EDT	is	an	extension	of	the	task	of 
coreference resolution in that in EDT we not
only resolve the coreference between mentions 
but also detect the entities. Each of those entities
may have one or more mentions. In the ACE
project, there are five types of entities defined in 
EDT: person (PER), geography political Entity 
(GPE),  organization  (ORG),  location  (LOC), 
and facility (FAC). Many traditional coreference 
techniques can be extended to EDT for entity 
tracking.
   Early work on pronoun anaphora resolution 
usually  uses  rule-based  methods  (e.g.  Hobbs
1976; Ge et al., 1998; Mitkov, 1998), which try 
to mine the cues of the relation between the pro- 
nouns  and  its  antecedents.  Recent  research
(Soon et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2003; Ng and
Cardie, 2002; Ittycherah et al., 2003; Luo et al.,
2004) focuses on the use of statistical machine 
learning methods and tries to resolve references 
among all kinds of noun phases, including name,
nominal and pronoun phrase. One common ap-
proach applied by them is to first train a binary 
statistical model to measure how likely a pair of

mentions corefer; and then followed by a greedy 
procedure to group the mentions into entities.
   Mention detection is to find all the named en- 
tity, noun or noun phrase, pronoun or pronoun 
phrase. Therefore, it needs Named Entity Rec-
ognition, but not only. Though the detection of
entity mentions is an essential problem for 
EDT/coreference, there has been relatively less 
previous research. Ng and Cardie (2002) shows 
that improving the recall of noun phrase identi- 
fication can improve the performance of a 
coreference system. Florian et al. (2004) formu- 
late the mention detection problem as a charac- 
ter-based classification problem. They assign for 
each character in the text a label, indicating 
whether it is the start of a specific mention, in- 
side a specific mention, or outside of any men- 
tion.
In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  unified  EDT
model   based   on   the   Transformation  Based
Learning (TBL, Brill, 1995) framework for Chi- 
nese. The model consists of two sub models: a 
mention detection model and a coreference 
model. The first sub-model is used to adapt ex- 
isting Chinese word segmentation and Named 
Entity  (NE)  recognition  system  to  a  specific 
EDT standard. TBL is a widely used machine 
learning method, but it is the first time it is ap- 
plied to coreference resolution. In addition, a 
feedback technique is proposed to further im- 
prove the performance of the system.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In section 2, we propose the unified TBL Chi- 
nese EDT model framework. We describe the 
four key techniques of our Chinese EDT, the 
word segmentation adaptation model, the men- 
tion detection model, the coreference model and 
the feedback technique in section 3, 4, 5 and 6 
accordingly. The experimental results on the 
ACE Chinese EDT corpus are shown in section
7.

2    The Unified System Framework

Our Chinese EDT system consists of two com- 
ponents, mention detection module and corefer- 
ence module besides a feedback technique 
between them as illustrated in Figure 1.
   MSRSeg (Gao et al., 2003; Gao et al.), Mi- 
crosoft Research Asia’s Chinese word segmen-
tation   system   that   is   integrated   with   named	 	
entity recognition, is used to segment Chinese
words. However MSRSeg can’t well match the 
standard  of  ACE  EDT  evaluation  for  either 
types or boundaries. The difference of the stan- 
dard  of  named  entity  between  MSRSeg  and 
ACE cause more than half of the errors for 
NAME mention detection. In order to overcome 
these problems, we integrate a segmentation 
adapter to mention detection model.
   The EDT system is a unified system that uses 
the TBL scheme. The idea of TBL is to learn a
list of ordered rules while progressively improve
upon the current state of the training set. An ini- 
tial assignment is made based on simple statis- 
tics,  and  then  rules  are  greedily  learned  to 
correct the mistakes, until no more improvement 
can be made. There are three main problems in 
the TBL framework: An initial state assignment, 
a set of allowable templates for rules, and an 
objective function for learning.

flow.

3    Word Segmentation Adaptation

The method of applying TBL to adapt the Chi- 
nese word segmentation standard has been de- 
scribed in Gao et al. (2004). Our approach is 
slightly different for not have a correctly seg- 
mented corpus according to ACE standard.
   From the un-segmented ACE EDT corpus, 
we can only obtain mention boundary informa- 
tion. So the adapting objective is to detect the 
mention boundary instead of all words in text, 
correctly. In the corpus, very few mentions’ 
boundaries are crossing1.
   The initial state of the segmentation adapta- 
tion model is the output of MSRSeg. And we

heads not.


define two actions in the model, inserting and 
removing a boundary. The prefix or suffix of 
current word is used to define the boundary of 
inserting. Both inserting and removing action 
consider the combination of POS tag and word 
string of current, left and right words.
   When inserting a boundary, the right part of 
the word keeps the old POS tag, and the left part 
introduces a special POS tag “new”. When re- 
moving a boundary, the new formed word intro- 
duces a special POS tag “new”. The following 
two examples illustrate the strategy.

4	Mention Detection

Since the word segmentation adaptation model 
has corrected the boundaries of mentions, our 
mention  detection  model  bases  on  word  and 
only  tagging  the  entity  mention  types.  The 
model detects the mentions by tagging sixteen 
tags (including the combination of five entity 
types and three mention types and “OTHER” tag) 
for all the words outputted by segmentation ad- 
aptation model. The templates, as illustrated in 
table 1, only refer to local features, such as POS 
tag and word string of left, right, and current 
words; the suffix, and single character feature of 
current word.

MR2: MT13 0 nr PER
MR3: MT13 0 nt ORG 
MR4: MT16 n PER NPER 
MR5: MT16 new ORG GPE
   In table 1, “MT1” et al represent the id of the 
templates; “R1”, “R2”, “R3” and “R4” represent 
the suffix of current word and the number of
character is 1, 2, 3 and 4 accordingly; other suf- 
fix “_1”, “0”, “1” means the left, current and 
right words’ feature; “W” represent the string of 
word; “P” represent POS tag; “T” represent 
mention tag; “S” represent the binary-value sin- 
gle character feature.
   Five best transformation rules are illustrated 
in Table 2. For example, MR3 means “if current 
word’s POS tag is nt, then it is a ORG”. Follow- 
ing example well describe the process of apply- 
ing these rules.

5    Entity Tracking

In our entity tracking/coreference model, the 
initial state is let each mention in a document 
form an entity, as shown in Figure 2 (a). And the 
objective function directs the learning process to 
insert or remove chains between mentions (Fig- 
ure 2 b and c) to approach the goal state (Figure
2 f).
   A list of rules is learned in greedy fashion, 
according to the objective function. When no 
rule that improves the current state of the train-
ing set beyond a pre-set threshold can be found,
the training phrase ends. The objective function 
in our system is driven by the correctness of the 
binary classification for pair-wise mention pairs.
   The TBL entity tracking model has more 
widely clustering/searching space as compare 
with previous strategies (Soon et al. 2001; Ng 
and Cardie, 2002; Luo et al., 2004). For example, 
the state shown in Figure 2 (d) is not reachable 
for them. Because they assume one mention 
should refer to its most confidential mentions or 
entities that before it, while A and B are obvi- 
ously not in same entity, as we can see in Figure
2 (d). Thus C can refer to either A or B, but not 
both. While in TBL model, this state is allowed.
   In order to keep our system robust, the trans- 
formation templates refer to only six types of
simple features, as described below.
   All these features do not need any high level 
tools (i.e. syntactic parser) and little external 
knowledge base. In fact, only a country name 
abbreviation list (171 entrances) and a Chinese


province alias list (34 entrances) are used to de- 
tect “alias” relation for String Match feature.
   String Match feature (STRM): Its possible 
values are exact, alias, abbr, left, right, other. If 
two mentions are exact string matched, then re-
turn exact; else if one mention is an alias of the
other, then return alias; else if one mention is 
the abbreviation of the other, then return abbr; 
else if one mention is the left substring of the 
other, then return left; else if one mention is the 
right substring of the other, then return right; 
else return other.

Figure 2. The procedure of TBL entity track- 
ing/coreference model
   Edit Distance feature I (ED1): Its possible 
values are true or false. If the edit distance of the
two mentions are less than or equal to 1, then
return true, else return false.
   Token Distance feature I (TD1): Its possi- 
ble values are true or false. If the edit distance of 
the two mentions are less than or equal to 1(i.e.,
there are not more than one token between the 
two mentions), then return true, else return false.
Mention Type (MT): Its possible values are
NAME, NOMINAL, or PRONOUN..
Entity  Type  (ET):  Its  possible  values  are
PER, GPE, ORG, LOC, or FAC.
   Mention String (M): Its possible values are 
the actual mention string.

These six features can be divided into two 
categories: mention pair features (the first three) 
and  single mention features (the  other three). 
And  the  single  mention  features  are  suffixed 
with “L” or “R” to differentiate for left or right 
mentions (i.e. ETL represent the left mention’s 
entity type).
   Based on the six kinds of basic features, four 
simple transformation templates are used in our 
system, as listed in table 3.

CT2: MTL,MTR,ETL,ETR,ED1

   Though  trained  on  
different  data  set  will learn 
different rules, the four rules 
listed in table
4 is the best rules that always 
been learned. For example, the 
first rule means that “If two 
NAME mentions are exact 
string matched, then insert a
chain between them”. The

6	Feedback

There are three reasons push us apply feedback
technique in the EDT system. The first is to de- 
termine whether a signal character is an abbre- 
viation  is  discourse  depended.  For  example,
Chinese character “ 中 ” can represents both a
country name “China” and a common preposi- 
tion “in”. If it can links to “ 中 国/China” by
coreference  model,  it  is  likely  to  represent
“China”. The second is the definition of men- 
tions  is  hard  to  hold,  especially  the  nominal
mentions. An isolated mention is more likely not 
to be a mention. The third is to pick up lost men-
tion according to its multi-appearance in the dis- 
course. In fact, [Ji and Crishman, 2004] has used
five hubristic rules based on coreference results 
to improve the name recognition result. While in
this section we will present an automatic method.
   The feedback technique is employed by us- 
ing entity features in mention detection model. 
In our model, the transformation templates refer 
to the number of mentions in the entity, the sin-
gle character feature, the entity type feature, the 
mention  type  feature  and  mention  string,  as 
listed follows.
SDD: Its possible values are the combination
of the mention type and entity type of the men- 
tion string in discourse: PER, GPE, ORG, LOC, 
FAC, NPER (NOMINAL PER), NGPE, NORG, 
NLOC, NFAC, PPER (PROUNOUN PER), 
PGPE, PORG, PLOC, and PFAC.
   SC2, SC3, SC4: Their possible values are 
true or false. If the word string appear not less 
than 2 (3, 4) times in the discourse then return
true, else return false.
   PDD: presents the combination of the men- 
tion type and entity type of the mention in dis- 
course. Its possible values are same with “SDD”.
PC2: Its possible values are true or false. If
the mention belong to an entity has not less than
2 mentions then return true, else return false.
   S0: Its possible values are true or false. If the 
mention is a single character word then return 
true, else return false.
W0: string of the mention.

Table 6. Examples of transformation rules of 
feedback.

   The first rule means that “if a word in the 
document appears as  person name  more  than 
two times, then it is a person name”. This rule 
can pick up lost person names. The second rule 
means that “if a GPE mention is isolated and it 
is a single character word, then it is not a men- 
tion”. This rule can throw away isolated abbre-
viation of GPE, as illustrated in the 
following example.

7    Experiments

Our experiments are conducted on Chinese 
EDT
corpus for ACE project from LDC. This 
corpus is the training data for ACE 
evaluation 2003. The corpus has two types, 
paper news (nwire) and broadcast news 
(bnews). the statistics of the corpus is shown 
in Table 7.
Table 7. Statistics of the ACE corpus.

       Mention                  5423                     4506         
   Because the test data for ACE evaluation 
is not public, we randomly and equally 
divide the corpus into 3 subsets: set0, set1, 
set2. Each con- sists of about 73 
documents and 33K Chinese
Characters2. Cross experiments are conducted
on these data sets. ACE-value is used to 
evaluate 
the EDT system; and precision (P), recall 
(R) and F (F=2*P*R/(P+R)) to evaluate the 
mention detection result.
   In the experiments, we first use one data 
set train the mention detection system; then 
use an- other set train the coreference 
model based on the output of the mention 
detection; finally use the other set test. In 
practice, we can retrain the mention 
detection model use the two train set to get 
higher performance.

2 Two of the documents (CTS20001110.1300.0506, and 
XIN20001102.2000.0207) in the corpus are not 
use for serious annotation error.

   In Table 8, “SegTag” represent the mention 
detection system integrated with segmentation 
adaptation, “Tag” represent the mention detec- 
tion system without segmentation adaptation. 
“+F” means with feedback.
   The ACE-value of our Chinese EDT system 
is better than 58.8% of Florian et al. (2004). In 
fact, the two systems are not comparable for not
basing on the same training and test data. How-
ever both corpora are under the same standard 
from ACE project, and our training data (about
66K) is smaller than Florian et al. (2004) (about
80K). Therefore, it is an encouraging result.
   Segmentation adapting and feedback can im- 
prove 7.5% of ACE-value for the whole system. 
As we can see from Table 8, using TBL method
to adapt standard or correct errors can improve
the mention detection performance especially 
recall, and word segmentation adapting is essen- 
tial for mention detection. Feedback can im- 
prove the precision of mention detection with 
loss of recall. The two techniques can signifi- 
cantly improve the EDT performance, since the 
p-value of the T-test for the performance of 
“SegTag” to “Tag” is 96.7%, while for “Seg- 
Tag+F” to “Tag” is 98.9%. The recall of men- 
tion detection is dropped after feedback because 
of the great effect of rule FR2, 3, 4 and 5 as il- 
lustrated in table 6.

8    Conclusion

In this paper, we integrate the mention detection 
model  and  entity  tracking/coreference  model 
into a unified TBL framework. Experimental 
results show segmentation adapting and feed- 
back can significantly improve the performance 
of EDT system. And even with very limited 
knowledge and shallow NLP tools, our method 
can reach comparable performance with related 
work.
