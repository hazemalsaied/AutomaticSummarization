Abstract
We propose an automatic method of extracting
paraphrases from definition sentences, which
are also automatically acquired from the Web.
We observe that a huge number of concepts
are defined in Web documents, and that the
sentences that define the same concept tend
to convey mostly the same information using
different expressions and thus contain many
paraphrases. We show that a large number
of paraphrases can be automatically extracted
with high precision by regarding the sentences
that define the same concept as parallel cor-
pora. Experimental results indicated that with
our method it was possible to extract about
300,000 paraphrases from 6? 108 Web docu-
ments with a precision rate of about 94%.
1 Introduction
Natural language allows us to express the same in-
formation in many ways, which makes natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) a challenging area. Ac-
cordingly, many researchers have recognized that
automatic paraphrasing is an indispensable compo-
nent of intelligent NLP systems (Iordanskaja et al,
1991; McKeown et al, 2002; Lin and Pantel, 2001;
Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Kauchak and Barzi-
lay, 2006; Callison-Burch et al, 2006) and have tried
to acquire a large amount of paraphrase knowledge,
which is a key to achieving robust automatic para-
phrasing, from corpora (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Barzi-
lay and McKeown, 2001; Shinyama et al, 2002;
Barzilay and Lee, 2003).
We propose a method to extract phrasal para-
phrases from pairs of sentences that define the same
concept. The method is based on our observation
that two sentences defining the same concept can
be regarded as a parallel corpus since they largely
convey the same information using different expres-
sions. Such definition sentences abound on the Web.
This suggests that we may be able to extract a large
amount of phrasal paraphrase knowledge from the
definition sentences on the Web.
For instance, the following two sentences, both of
which define the same concept ?osteoporosis?, in-
clude two pairs of phrasal paraphrases, which are
indicated by underlines 1? and 2?, respectively.
(1) a. Osteoporosis is a disease that 1? decreases the
quantity of bone and 2? makes bones fragile.
b. Osteoporosis is a disease that 1? reduces bone
mass and 2? increases the risk of bone fracture.
We define paraphrase as a pair of expressions be-
tween which entailment relations of both directions
hold. (Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis, 2010).
Our objective is to extract phrasal paraphrases
from pairs of sentences that define the same con-
cept. We propose a supervised method that exploits
various kinds of lexical similarity features and con-
textual features. Sentences defining certain concepts
are acquired automatically on a large scale from the
Web by applying a quite simple supervised method.
Previous methods most relevant to our work
used parallel corpora such as multiple translations
of the same source text (Barzilay and McKeown,
2001) or automatically acquired parallel news texts
(Shinyama et al, 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003;
Dolan et al, 2004). The former requires a large
amount of manual labor to translate the same texts
1087
in several ways. The latter would suffer from the
fact that it is not easy to automatically retrieve large
bodies of parallel news text with high accuracy. On
the contrary, recognizing definition sentences for
the same concept is quite an easy task at least for
Japanese, as we will show, and we were able to find
a huge amount of definition sentence pairs from nor-
mal Web texts. In our experiments, about 30 million
definition sentence pairs were extracted from 6?108
Web documents, and the estimated number of para-
phrases recognized in the definition sentences using
our method was about 300,000, for a precision rate
of about 94%. Also, our experimental results show
that our method is superior to well-known compet-
ing methods (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Koehn
et al, 2007) for extracting paraphrases from defini-
tion sentence pairs.
Our evaluation is based on bidirectional check-
ing of entailment relations between paraphrases that
considers the context dependence of a paraphrase.
Note that using definition sentences is only the
beginning of our research on paraphrase extraction.
We have a more general hypothesis that sentences
fulfilling the same pragmatic function (e.g. defini-
tion) for the same topic (e.g. osteoporosis) convey
mostly the same information using different expres-
sions. Such functions other than definition may in-
clude the usage of the same Linux command, the
recipe for the same cuisine, or the description of re-
lated work on the same research issue.
Section 2 describes related works. Section 3
presents our proposed method. Section 4 reports on
evaluation results. Section 5 concludes the paper.
2 Related Work
The existing work for paraphrase extraction is cat-
egorized into two groups. The first involves a dis-
tributional similarity approach pioneered by Lin and
Pantel (2001). Basically, this approach assumes that
two expressions that have a large distributional simi-
larity are paraphrases. There are also variants of this
approach that address entailment acquisition (Geffet
and Dagan, 2005; Bhagat et al, 2007; Szpektor and
Dagan, 2008; Hashimoto et al, 2009). These meth-
ods can be applied to a normal monolingual corpus,
and it has been shown that a large number of para-
phrases or entailment rules could be extracted. How-
ever, the precision of these methods has been rela-
tively low. This is due to the fact that the evidence,
i.e., distributional similarity, is just indirect evidence
of paraphrase/entailment. Accordingly, these meth-
ods occasionally mistake antonymous pairs for para-
phrases/entailment pairs, since an expression and its
antonymous counterpart are also likely to have a
large distributional similarity. Another limitation of
these methods is that they can find only paraphrases
consisting of frequently observed expressions since
they must have reliable distributional similarity val-
ues for expressions that constitute paraphrases.
The second category is a parallel corpus approach
(Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shinyama et al,
2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Dolan et al, 2004).
Our method belongs to this category. This approach
aligns expressions between two sentences in par-
allel corpora, based on, for example, the overlap
of words/contexts. The aligned expressions are as-
sumed to be paraphrases. In this approach, the ex-
pressions do not need to appear frequently in the
corpora. Furthermore, the approach rarely mistakes
antonymous pairs for paraphrases/entailment pairs.
However, its limitation is the difficulty in preparing
a large amount of parallel corpora, as noted before.
We avoid this by using definition sentences, which
can be easily acquired on a large scale from theWeb,
as parallel corpora.
Murata et al (2004) used definition sentences in
two manually compiled dictionaries, which are con-
siderably fewer in the number of definition sen-
tences than those on the Web. Thus, the coverage of
their method should be quite limited. Furthermore,
the precision of their method is much poorer than
ours as we report in Section 4.
For a more extensive survey on paraphrasing
methods, see Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis
(2010) and Madnani and Dorr (2010).
3 Proposed method
Our method, targeting the Japanese language, con-
sists of two steps: definition sentence acquisition
and paraphrase extraction. We describe them below.
3.1 Definition sentence acquisition
We acquire sentences that define a concept (defini-
tion sentences) as in Example (2), which defines ??
1088
???? (osteoporosis), from the 6?108 Web pages
(Akamine et al, 2010) and the Japanese Wikipedia.
(2) ??????????????????????
(Osteoporosis is a disease that makes bones fragile.)
Fujii and Ishikawa (2002) developed an unsuper-
vised method to find definition sentences from the
Web using 18 sentential templates and a language
model constructed from an encyclopedia. On the
other hand, we developed a supervised method to
achieve a higher precision.
We use one sentential template and an SVM clas-
sifier. Specifically, we first collect definition sen-
tence candidates by a template ??NP??.*?, where
? is the beginning of sentence and NP is the noun
phrase expressing the concept to be defined followed
by a particle sequence, ??? (comitative) and ???
(topic) (and optionally followed by comma), as ex-
emplified in (2). As a result, we collected 3,027,101
sentences. Although the particle sequence tends
to mark the topic of the definition sentence, it can
also appear in interrogative sentences and normal as-
sertive sentences in which a topic is strongly empha-
sized. To remove such non-definition sentences, we
classify the candidate sentences using an SVM clas-
sifier with a polynominal kernel (d = 2).1 Since
Japanese is a head-final language and we can judge
whether a sentence is interrogative or not from the
last words in the sentence, we included morpheme
N -grams and bag-of-words (with the window size
of N ) at the end of sentences in the feature set. The
features are also useful for confirming that the head
verb is in the present tense, which definition sen-
tences should be. Also, we added the morpheme
N -grams and bag-of-words right after the particle
sequence in the feature set since we observe that
non-definition sentences tend to have interrogative
related words like ??? (what) or ???? ((what) on
earth) right after the particle sequence. We chose 5
as N from our preliminary experiments.
Our training data was constructed from 2,911 sen-
tences randomly sampled from all of the collected
sentences. 61.1% of them were labeled as positive.
In the 10-fold cross validation, the classifier?s ac-
curacy, precision, recall, and F1 were 89.4, 90.7,

joachims.org/.
92.2, and 91.4, respectively. Using the classifier,
we acquired 1,925,052 positive sentences from all
of the collected sentences. After adding definition
sentences from Wikipedia articles, which are typi-
cally the first sentence of the body of each article
(Kazama and Torisawa, 2007), we obtained a total
of 2,141,878 definition sentence candidates, which
covered 867,321 concepts ranging from weapons to
rules of baseball. Then, we coupled two definition
sentences whose defined concepts were the same
and obtained 29,661,812 definition sentence pairs.
Obviously, our method is tailored to Japanese. For
a language-independent method of definition acqui-
sition, see Navigli and Velardi (2010) as an example.
3.2 Paraphrase extraction
Paraphrase extraction proceeds as follows. First,
each sentence in a pair is parsed by the depen-
dency parser KNP2 and dependency tree frag-
ments that constitute linguistically well-formed con-
stituents are extracted. The extracted dependency
tree fragments are called candidate phrases here-
after. We restricted candidate phrases to predicate
phrases that consist of at least one dependency re-
lation, do not contain demonstratives, and in which
all the leaf nodes are nominal and all of the con-
stituents are consecutive in the sentence. KNP indi-
cates whether each candidate phrase is a predicate
based on the POS of the head morpheme. Then,
we check all the pairs of candidate phrases between
two definition sentences to find paraphrase pairs.3
In (1), repeated in (3), candidate phrase pairs to be
checked include ( 1? decreases the quantity of bone,
1? reduces bone mass), ( 1? decreases the quantity
of bone, 2? increases the risk of bone fracture), ( 2?
makes bones fragile, 1? reduces bone mass), and ( 2?
makes bones fragile, 2? increases the risk of bone
fracture).
(3) a. Osteoporosis is a disease that 1? decreases the
quantity of bone and 2? makes bones fragile.
b. Osteoporosis is a disease that 1? reduces bone
mass and 2? increases the risk of bone fracture.

3Our method discards candidate phrase pairs in which one
subsumes the other in terms of their character string, or the dif-
ference is only one proper noun like ?toner cartridges that Ap-
ple Inc. made? and ?toner cartridges that Xerox made.? Proper
nouns are recognized by KNP.

f1 The ratio of the number of morphemes shared between two candidate phrases to the number of all of the morphemes in the two phrases.
f2 The ratio of the number of a candidate phrase?s morphemes, for which there is a morpheme with small edit distance (1 in our experiment) in
another candidate phrase, to the number of all of the morphemes in the two phrases. Note that Japanese has many orthographical variations
and edit distance is useful for identifying them.
f3 The ratio of the number of a candidate phrase?s morphemes, for which there is a morpheme with the same pronunciation in another candidate
phrase, to the number of all of the morphemes in the two phrases. Pronunciation is also useful for identifying orthographic variations.
Pronunciation is given by KNP.
f4 The ratio of the number of morphemes of a shorter candidate phrase to that of a longer one.
f5 The identity of the inflected form of the head morpheme between two candidate phrases: 1 if they are identical, 0 otherwise.
f6 The identity of the POS of the head morpheme between two candidate phrases: 1 or 0.
f7 The identity of the inflection (conjugation) of the head morpheme between two candidate phrases: 1 or 0.
f8 The ratio of the number of morphemes that appear in a candidate phrase segment of a definition sentence s1 and in a segment that is NOT a
part of the candidate phrase of another definition sentence s2 to the number of all of the morphemes of s1?s candidate phrase, i.e. how many
extra morphemes are incorporated into s1?s candidate phrase.
f9 The reversed (s1 ? s2) version of f8.
f10 The ratio of the number of parent dependency tree fragments that are shared by two candidate phrases to the number of all of the parent de-
pendency tree fragments of the two phrases. Dependency tree fragments are represented by the pronunciation of their component morphemes.
f11 A variation of f10; tree fragments are represented by the base form of their component morphemes.
f12 A variation of f10; tree fragments are represented by the POS of their component morphemes.
f13 The ratio of the number of unigrams (morphemes) that appear in the child context of both candidate phrases to the number of all of the child
context morphemes of both candidate phrases. Unigrams are represented by the pronunciation of the morpheme.
f14 A variation of f13; unigrams are represented by the base form of the morpheme.
f15 A variation of f14; the numerator is the number of child context unigrams that are adjacent to both candidate phrases.
f16 The ratio of the number of trigrams that appear in the child context of both candidate phrases to the number of all of the child context
morphemes of both candidate phrases. Trigrams are represented by the pronunciation of the morpheme.
f17 Cosine similarity between two definition sentences from which a candidate phrase pair is extracted.
Table 1: Features used by paraphrase classifier.
The paraphrase checking of candidate phrase
pairs is performed by an SVM classifier with a linear
kernel that classifies each pair of candidate phrases
into a paraphrase or a non-paraphrase.4 Candidate
phrase pairs are ranked by their distance from the
SVM?s hyperplane. Features for the classifier are
based on our observation that two candidate phrases
tend to be paraphrases if the candidate phrases them-
selves are sufficiently similar and/or their surround-
ing contexts are sufficiently similar. Table 1 lists the
features used by the classifier.5 Basically, they rep-
resent either the similarity of candidate phrases (f1-
9) or that of their contexts (f10-17). We think that
they have various degrees of discriminative power,
and thus we use the SVM to adjust their weights.
Figure 1 illustrates features f8-12, for which you
may need supplemental remarks. English is used for
ease of explanation. In the figure, f8 has a positive
value since the candidate phrase of s1 contains mor-
phemes ?of bone?, which do not appear in the can-

date phrase in terms of the dependency structure of the sentence.
Child contexts are defined similarly.

didate phrase of s2 but do appear in the other part
of s2, i.e. they are extra morphemes for s1?s candi-
date phrase. On the other hand, f9 is zero since there
is no such extra morpheme in s2?s candidate phrase.
Also, features f10-12 have positive values since the
two candidate phrases share two parent dependency
tree fragments, (that increases) and (of fracture).
We have also tried the following features, which
we do not detail due to space limitation: the sim-
ilarity of candidate phrases based on semantically
similar nouns (Kazama and Torisawa, 2008), entail-
ing/entailed verbs (Hashimoto et al, 2009), and the
identity of the pronunciation and base form of the
head morpheme; N -grams (N=1,2,3) of child and
parent contexts represented by either the inflected
form, base form, pronunciation, or POS of mor-

pheme; parent/child dependency tree fragments rep-
resented by either the inflected form, base form, pro-
nunciation, or POS; adjacent versions (cf. f15) of
N -gram features and parent/child dependency tree
features. These amount to 78 features, but we even-
tually settled on the 17 features in Table 1 through
ablation tests to evaluate the discriminative power
of each feature.
The ablation tests were conducted using training
data that we prepared. In preparing the training data,
we faced the problem that the completely random
sampling of candidate paraphrase pairs provided us
with only a small number of positive examples.
Thus, we automatically collected candidate para-
phrase pairs that were expected to have a high like-
lihood of being positive as examples to be labeled.
The likelihood was calculated by simply summing
all of the 78 feature values that we have tried, since
they indicate the likelihood of a given candidate
paraphrase pair?s being a paraphrase. Note that val-
ues of the features f8 and f9 are weighted with ?1,
since they indicate the unlikelihood. Specifically,
we first randomly sampled 30,000 definition sen-
tence pairs from the 29,661,812 pairs, and collected
3,000 candidate phrase pairs that had the highest
likelihood from them. The manual labeling of each
candidate phrase pair (p1, p2) was based on bidirec-
tional checking of entailment relation, p1 ? p2 and
p2 ? p1, with p1 and p2 embedded in contexts.
This scheme is similar to the one proposed by
Szpektor et al (2007). We adopt this scheme since
paraphrase judgment might be unstable between an-
notators unless they are given a particular context
based on which they make a judgment. As de-
scribed below, we use definition sentences as con-
texts. We admit that annotators might be biased by
this in some unexpected way, but we believe that
this is a more stable method than that without con-
texts. The labeling process is as follows. First, from
each candidate phrase pair (p1, p2) and its source
definition sentence pair (s1, s2), we create two para-
phrase sentence pairs (s?1, s?2) by exchanging p1 and
p2 between s1 and s2. Then, annotators check if s1
entails s?1 and s2 entails s?2 so that entailment rela-
tions of both directions p1 ? p2 and p2 ? p1 are
checked. Figure 2 shows an example of bidirectional
checking. In this example, both entailment relations,
s1 ? s?1 and s2 ? s?2, hold, and thus the candidate
phrase pair (p1, p2) is judged as positive. We used
(p1, p2), for which entailment relations of both di-
rections held, as positive examples (1,092 pairs) and
the others as negative ones (1,872 pairs).6
We built the paraphrase classifier from the train-
ing data. As mentioned, candidate phrase pairs were
ranked by the distance from the SVM?s hyperplane.
4 Experiment
In this paper, our claims are twofold.
I. Definition sentences on the Web are a treasure
trove of paraphrase knowledge (Section 4.2).
II. Our method of paraphrase acquisition from
definition sentences is more accurate than well-
known competing methods (Section 4.1).
We first verify claim II by comparing our method
with that of Barzilay and McKeown (2001) (BM
method), Moses7 (Koehn et al, 2007) (SMT
method), and that of Murata et al (2004) (Mrt
method). The first two methods are well known for
accurately extracting semantically equivalent phrase
pairs from parallel corpora.8 Then, we verify claim
6The remaining 36 pairs were discarded as they contained
garbled characters of Japanese.

vised methods and thus unable to be adapted to definition sen-

I by comparing definition sentence pairs with sen-
tence pairs that are acquired from the Web using Ya-
hoo!JAPANAPI9 as a paraphrase knowledge source.
In the latter data set, two sentences of each pair
are expected to be semantically similar regardless of
whether they are definition sentences. Both sets con-
tain 100,000 pairs.
Three annotators (not the authors) checked evalu-
ation samples. Fleiss? kappa (Fleiss, 1971) was 0.69
(substantial agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977)).
4.1 Our method vs. competing methods
In this experiment, paraphrase pairs are extracted
from 100,000 definition sentence pairs that are ran-
domly sampled from the 29,661,812 pairs. Before
reporting the experimental results, we briefly de-
scribe the BM, SMT, and Mrt methods.
BM method Given parallel sentences like multi-
ple translations of the same source text, the BM
method works iteratively as follows. First, it collects
from the parallel sentences identical word pairs and
their contexts (POS N -grams with indices indicat-
ing corresponding words between paired contexts)
as positive examples and those of different word
pairs as negative ones. Then, each context is ranked
based on the frequency with which it appears in pos-
itive (negative) examples. The most likely K posi-
tive (negative) contexts are used to extract positive
(negative) paraphrases from the parallel sentences.
Extracted positive (negative) paraphrases and their
morpho-syntactic patterns are used to collect addi-
tional positive (negative) contexts. All the positive
(negative) contexts are ranked, and additional para-
phrases and their morpho-syntactic patterns are ex-
tracted again. This iterative process finishes if no
further paraphrase is extracted or the number of iter-
ations reaches a predefined threshold T . In this ex-
periment, following Barzilay and McKeown (2001),
K is 10 and N is 1 to 3. The value of T is not given
in their paper. We chose 3 as its value based on our
preliminary experiments. Note that paraphrases ex-
tracted by this method are not ranked.
tences. Nevertheless, we believe that comparing these methods
with ours is very informative, since they are known to be accu-
rate and have been influential.
9http://developer.yahoo.co.jp/webapi/
SMT method Our SMT method uses Moses
(Koehn et al, 2007) and extracts a phrase table, a
set of two phrases that are translations of each other,
given a set of two sentences that are translations of
each other. If you give Moses monolingual parallel
sentence pairs, it should extract a set of two phrases
that are paraphrases of each other. In this experi-
ment, default values were used for all parameters.
To rank extracted phrase pairs, we assigned each of
them the product of two phrase translation probabil-
ities of both directions that were given by Moses.
For other SMT methods, see Quirk et al (2004) and
Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) among others.
Mrt method Murata et al (2004) proposed a
method to extract paraphrases from two manually
compiled dictionaries. It simply regards a difference
between two definition sentences of the same word
as a paraphrase candidate. Paraphrase candidates are
ranked according to an unsupervised scoring scheme
that implements their assumption. They assume that
a paraphrase candidate tends to be a valid paraphrase
if it is surrounded by infrequent strings and/or if it
appears multiple times in the data.
In this experiment, we evaluated the unsupervised
version of our method in addition to the supervised
one described in Section 3.2, in order to compare
it fairly with the other methods. The unsupervised
method works in the same way as the supervised
one, except that it ranks candidate phrase pairs by
the sum of all 17 feature values, instead of the dis-
tance from the SVM?s hyperplane. In other words,
no supervised learning is used. All the feature val-
ues are weighted with 1, except for f8 and f9, which
are weighted with ?1 since they indicate the unlike-
lihood of a candidate phrase pair being paraphrases.
BM, SMT, Mrt, and the two versions of our method
were used to extract paraphrase pairs from the same
100,000 definition sentence pairs.
Evaluation scheme Evaluation of each para-
phrase pair (p1, p2) was based on bidirectional
checking of entailment relations p1 ? p2 and p2 ?
p1 in a way similar to the labeling of the training
data. The difference is that contexts for evaluation
are two sentences that are retrieved from the Web
and contain p1 and p2, instead of definition sen-
tences from which p1 and p2 are extracted. This
1092
is intended to check whether extracted paraphrases
are also valid for contexts other than those from
which they are extracted. The evaluation proceeds
as follows. For the top m paraphrase pairs of each
method (in the case of the BM method, randomly
sampled m pairs were used, since the method does
not rank paraphrase pairs), we retrieved a sentence
pair (s1, s2) for each paraphrase pair (p1, p2) from
the Web, such that s1 contains p1 and s2 contains p2.
In doing so, we make sure that neither s1 nor s2 are
the definition sentences from which p1 and p2 are
extracted. For each method, we randomly sample
n samples from all of the paraphrase pairs (p1, p2)
for which both s1 and s2 are retrieved. Then, from
each (p1, p2) and (s1, s2), we create two paraphrase
sentence pairs (s?1, s?2) by exchanging p1 and p2 be-
tween s1 and s2. All samples, each consisting of
(p1, p2), (s1, s2), and (s?1, s?2), are checked by three
human annotators to determine whether s1 entails
s?1 and s2 entails s?2 so that entailment relations of
both directions are verified. In advance of evaluation
annotation, all the evaluation samples are shuffled
so that the annotators cannot find out which sample
is given by which method for fairness. We regard
each paraphrase pair as correct if at least two annota-
tors judge that entailment relations of both directions
hold for it. You may wonder whether only one pair
of sentences (s1, s2) is enough for evaluation since a
correct (wrong) paraphrase pair might be judged as
wrong (correct) accidentally. Nevertheless, we sup-
pose that the final evaluation results are reliable if
the number of evaluation samples is sufficient. In
this experiment, m is 5,000 and n is 200. We use
Yahoo!JAPAN API to retrieve sentences.
Graph (a) in Figure 3 shows a precision curve
for each method. Sup and Uns respectively indi-
cate the supervised and unsupervised versions of our
method. The figure indicates that Sup outperforms
all the others and shows a high precision rate of
about 94% at the top 1,000. Remember that this
is the result of using 100,000 definition sentence
pairs. Thus, we estimate that Sup can extract about
300,000 paraphrase pairs with a precision rate of
about 94%, if we use all 29,661,812 definition sen-
tence pairs that we acquired.
Furthermore, we measured precision after trivial
paraphrase pairs were discarded from the evaluation
samples of each method. A candidate phrase pair

Table 2: Number of extracted paraphrases.
(p1, p2) is regarded as trivial if the pronunciation is
the same between p1 and p2,10 or all of the con-
tent words contained in p1 are the same as those
of p2. Graph (b) gives a precision curve for each
method. Again, Sup outperforms the others too, and
maintains a precision rate of about 90% until the top
1,000. These results support our claim II.
The upper half of Table 2 shows the number of
extracted paraphrases with/without trivial pairs for
each method.11 Sup and Uns extracted many more
paraphrases. It is noteworthy that Sup performed the
best in terms of both precision rate and the number
of extracted paraphrases.
Table 3 shows examples of correct and incorrect
outputs of Sup. As the examples indicate, many of
the extracted paraphrases are not specific to defini-
tion sentences and seem very reusable. However,
there are few paraphrases involving metaphors or id-
ioms in the outputs due to the nature of definition
sentences. In this regard, we do not claim that our
method is almighty. We agree with Sekine (2005)
who claims that several different methods are re-
quired to discover a wider variety of paraphrases.
In graphs (a) and (b), the precision of the SMT
method goes up as rank goes down. This strange be-
havior is due to the scoring by Moses that worked
poorly for the data; it gave 1.0 to 82.5% of all the
samples, 38.8% of which were incorrect. We suspect
SMTmethods are poor at monolingual alignment for
paraphrasing or entailment tasks since, in the tasks,
data is much noisier than that used for SMT. See
MacCartney et al (2008) for similar discussion.
4.2 Definition pairs vs. Web sentence pairs
To collect Web sentence pairs, first, we randomly
sampled 1.8 million sentences from the Web corpus.
10There are many kinds of orthographic variants in Japanese,
which can be identified by their pronunciation.
11We set no threshold for candidate phrase pairs of each
method, and counted all the candidate phrase pairs in Table 2.

We call them sampled sentences. Then, using Ya-
hoo!JAPANAPI, we retrieved up to 20 snippets rele-
vant to each sampled sentence using all of the nouns
in each sentence as a query. After that, each snippet
was split into sentences, which we call snippet sen-
tences. We paired a sampled sentence and a snippet
sentence that was the most similar to the sampled
sentence. Similarity is the number of nouns shared
by the two sentences. Finally, we randomly sampled
100,000 pairs from all the pairs.
Paraphrase pairs were extracted from the Web
sentence pairs by using BM, SMT, Mrt and the su-
pervised and unsupervised versions of our method.
The features used with our methods were selected
from all of the 78 features mentioned in Section 3.2
so that they performed well for Web sentence pairs.
Specifically, the features were selected by ablation
tests using training data that was tailored to Web
sentence pairs. The training data consisted of 2,741
sentence pairs that were collected in the same way as
the Web sentence pairs and was labeled in the same
way as described in Section 3.2.
Graph (c) of Figure 3 shows precision curves. We
also measured precision without trivial pairs in the
same way as the previous experiment. Graph (d)
shows the results. The lower half of Table 2 shows
the number of extracted paraphrases with/without
trivial pairs for each method.
Note that precision figures of our methods in
graphs (c) and (d) are lower than those of our meth-
ods in graphs (a) and (b). Additionally, none of the
methods achieved a precision rate of 90% using Web
sentence pairs.12 We think that a precision rate of
at least 90% would be necessary if you apply auto-
matically extracted paraphrases to NLP tasks with-
out manual annotation. Only the combination of Sup
and definition sentence pairs achieved that precision.
Also note that, for all of the methods, the numbers
of extracted paraphrases from Web sentence pairs
are fewer than those from definition sentence pairs.
From all of these results, we conclude that our
claim I is verified.
12Precision of SMT is unexpectedly good. We found some
Web sentence pairs consisting of two mostly identical sentences
on rare occasions. The method worked relatively well for them.
5 Conclusion
We proposed a method of extracting paraphrases
from definition sentences on the Web. From the ex-
perimental results, we conclude that the following
two claims of this paper are verified.
1. Definition sentences on the Web are a treasure
trove of paraphrase knowledge.
2. Our method extracts many paraphrases from
the definition sentences on the Web accurately;
it can extract about 300,000 paraphrases from
6 ? 108 Web documents with a precision rate
of about 94%.
Our future work is threefold. First, we will release
extracted paraphrases from all of the 29,661,812
definition sentence pairs that we acquired, after hu-
man annotators check their validity. The result will
be available through the ALAGIN forum.13
Second, we plan to induce paraphrase rules
from paraphrase instances. Though our method
can extract a variety of paraphrase instances on
a large scale, their coverage might be insufficient
for real NLP applications since some paraphrase
phenomena are highly productive. Therefore, we
need paraphrase rules in addition to paraphrase in-
stances. Barzilay and McKeown (2001) induced
simple POS-based paraphrase rules from paraphrase
instances, which can be a good starting point.
Finally, as mentioned in Section 1, the work in
this paper is only the beginning of our research on
paraphrase extraction. We are trying to extract far
more paraphrases from a set of sentences fulfilling
the same pragmatic function (e.g. definition) for the
same topic (e.g. osteoporosis) on the Web. Such
functions other than definition may include the us-
age of the same Linux command, the recipe for the
same cuisine, or the description of related work on
the same research issue.
