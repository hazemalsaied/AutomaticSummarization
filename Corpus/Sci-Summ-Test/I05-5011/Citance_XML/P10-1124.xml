			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">The Textual Entailment (TE) paradigm (Dagan et al., 2009) is a generic framework for applied semantic inference.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">The objective of TE is to recognize whether a target meaning can be inferred from a given text.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">For example, a Question Answering system has to recognize that ‘alcohol affects blood pressure’ is inferred from ‘alcohol reduces blood pressure’ to answer the question ‘What affects blood pressure?’ TE systems require extensive knowledge of entailment patterns, often captured as entailment rules: rules that specify a directional inference relation between two text fragments (when the rule is bidirectional this is known as paraphrasing).</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">An important type of entailment rule refers to propositional templates, i.e., propositions comprising a predicate and arguments, possibly replaced by variables.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">The rule required for the previous example would be ‘X reduce Y → X affect Y’.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Be cause facts and knowledge are mostly expressed by propositions, such entailment rules are central to the TE task.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">This has led to active research on broad-scale acquisition of entailment rules for predicates, e.g.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">(Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Previous work has focused on learning each entailment rule in isolation.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">However, it is clear that there are interactions between rules.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">A prominent example is that entailment is a transitive relation, and thus the rules ‘X → Y ’ and ‘Y → Z ’ imply the rule ‘X → Z ’.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">In this paper we take advantage of these global interactions to improve entailment rule learning.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">First, we describe a structure termed an entail- ment graph that models entailment relations between propositional templates (Section 3).</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Next, we show that we can present propositions according to an entailment hierarchy derived from the graph, and suggest a novel hierarchical presentation scheme for corpus propositions referring to a target concept.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">As in this application each graph focuses on a single concept, we term those focused entailment graphs (Section 4).</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">In the core section of the paper, we present an algorithm that uses a global approach to learn the entailment relations of focused entailment graphs (Section 5).</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">We define a global function and look for the graph that maximizes that function under a transitivity constraint.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">The optimization problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and solved with an ILP solver.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">We show that this leads to an optimal solution with respect to the global function, and demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms methods that utilize only local information by more than 10%, as well as methods that employ a greedy optimization algorithm rather than an ILP solver (Section 6).</S>

			<S sid ="23" ssid = "1">Entailment learning Two information types have primarily been utilized to learn entailment rules between predicates: lexicographic resources and distributional similarity resources.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "2">Lexicographic 1220 Proceedings of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 1220–1229, Uppsala, Sweden, 1116 July 2010.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "3">Qc 2010 Association for Computational Linguistics resources are manually-prepared knowledge bases containing information about semantic relations between lexical items.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "4">WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), by far the most widely used resource, specifies relations such as hyponymy, derivation, and entailment that can be used for semantic inference (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "5">WordNet has also been exploited to automatically generate a training set for a hyponym classifier (Snow et al., 2005), and we make a similar use of WordNet in Section 5.1.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "6">Lexicographic resources are accurate but tend to have low coverage.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "7">Therefore, distributional similarity is used to learn broad-scale resources.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "8">Distributional similarity algorithms predict a semantic relation between two predicates by comparing the arguments with which they occur.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "9">Quite a few methods have been suggested (Lin and Pan- tel, 2001; Bhagat et al., 2007; Yates and Etzioni, 2009), which differ in terms of the specifics of the ways in which predicates are represented, the features that are extracted, and the function used to compute feature vector similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "10">Details on such methods are given in Section 5.1.Global learning It is natural to describe en variables are integers, the problem is termed an Integer Linear Program (ILP).</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "11">Linear programming has attracted attention recently in several fields of NLP, such as semantic role labeling, summarization and parsing (Roth and tau Yih, 2005; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Martins et al., 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "12">In this paper we formulate the entailment graph learning problem as an Integer Linear Program, and find that this leads to an optimal solution with respect to the target function in our experiment.</S>

	<SECTION title="Entailment Graph. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "1">This section presents an entailment graph structure, which resembles the graph in (Szpektor and Dagan, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "2">The nodes of an entailment graph are propositional templates.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "3">A propositional template is a path in a dependency tree between two arguments of a common predicate1 (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "4">Note that in a dependency parse, such a path passes through the predicate.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "5">We require that a variable appears in at least one of the argument positions, and that each sense of a polysemous predicate corresponds to a separate template (and a separate graph node): X tailment relations between predicates by a graph.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "6">subj obj subj obj Nodes represent predicates, and edges represent entailment between nodes.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "7">Nevertheless, using a graph for global learning of entailment between predicates has attracted little attention.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "8">Recently, Szpektor and Dagan (2009) presented the resource Argument-mapped WordNet, providing entailment relations for predicates in WordNet.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "9">Their resource was built on top of WordNet, and makes simple use of WordNet’s global graph structure: new rules are suggested by transitively chaining graph edges, and verified against corpus statistics.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "10">The most similar work to ours is Snow et al.’s algorithm for taxonomy induction (2006).</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "11">Snow et al.’s algorithm learns the hyponymy relation, under the constraint that it is a transitive relation.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "12">Their algorithm incrementally adds hyponyms to an existing taxonomy (WordNet), using a greedy search algorithm that adds at each step the set of hyponyms that maximize the probability of the evidence while respecting the transitivity constraint.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "13">In this paper we tackle a similar problem of learning a transitive relation, but we use linear programming.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "14">A Linear Program (LP) is an optimization problem, where a linear function is minimized (or maximized) under linear constraints.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "15">If the←− treat#1 −→ Y and X ←− treat#1 −→ nau sea are propositional templates for the first sense of the predicate treat.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "16">An edge (u, v) represents the fact that template u entails template v. Note that the entailment relation transcends beyond hyponymy.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "17">For example, the template X is diagnosed with asthma entails the template X suffers from asthma, although one is not a hyponoym of the other.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "18">An example of an entailment graph is given in Figure 1, left.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "19">Since entailment is a transitive relation, an entailment graph is transitive, i.e., if the edges (u, v) and (v, w) are in the graph, so is the edge (u, w).</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "20">This is why we require that nodes be sense- specified, as otherwise transitivity does not hold:Possibly a → b for one sense of b, b → c for an other sense of b, but a --- c. Because graph nodes represent propositions, which generally have a clear truth value, we can assume that transitivity is indeed maintained along paths of any length in an entailment graph, as entailment between each pair of nodes either occurs or doesn’t occur with very high probability.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "21">We support this further in section 4.1, where we show 1 We restrict our discussion to templates with two arguments, but generalization is straightforward.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "22">X-related-to-nausea X-associated-with-n X-prevent-nausea X-help-with-na X-reduce-nausea X related to nausea headache Oxicontine help with nausea acupuncture prevent nausea ginger reduce nausea relaxation treat nausea drugs Nabilone Lorazepam Figure 1: Left: An entailment graph.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "23">For clarity, edges that can be inferred by transitivity are omitted.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "24">Right: A hierarchical summary of propositions involving nausea as an argument, such as headache is related to nausea, acupuncture helps with nausea, and Lorazepam treats nausea.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "25">that in our experimental setting the length of paths in the entailment graph is relatively small.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "26">Transitivity implies that in each strong connectivity component2 of the graph, all nodes are synonymous.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "27">Moreover, if we merge every strong connectivity component to a single node, the graph becomes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and the graph nodes can be sorted and presented hierarchically.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "28">Next, we show an application that leverages this property.</S>
	</SECTION>
	<SECTION title="Motivating Application. " number = "4">
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "1">In this section we propose an application that provides a hierarchical view of propositions extracted from a corpus, based on an entailment graph.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "2">Organizing information in large collections has been found to be useful for effective information access (Kaki, 2005; Stoica et al., 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "3">It allows for easier data exploration, and provides a compact view of the underlying content.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "4">A simple form of structural presentation is by a single hierarchy, e.g.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "5">(Hofmann, 1999).</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "6">A more complex approach is hierarchical faceted metadata, where a number of concept hierarchies are created, corresponding to different facets or dimensions (Stoica et al., 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "7">Hierarchical faceted metadata categorizes concepts of a domain in several dimensions, but does not specify the relations between them.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "8">For example, in the health-care domain we might have facets for categories such as diseases and symptoms.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "9">Thus, when querying about nausea, one might find it is related to vomitting and chicken pox, but not that chicken pox is a cause of nausea, 2 A strong connectivity component is a subset of nodes in the graph where there is a path from any node to any other node.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "10">while nausea is often accompanied by vomitting.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "11">We suggest that the prominent information in a text lies in the propositions it contains, which specify particular relations between the concepts.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "12">Propositions have been mostly presented through unstructured textual summaries or manually-constructed ontologies, which are expensive to build.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "13">We propose using the entail- ment graph structure, which describes entailment relations between predicates, to naturally present propositions hierarchically.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "14">That is, the entailment hierarchy can be used as an additional facet, which can improve navigation and provide a compact hierarchical summary of the propositions.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "15">Figure 1 illustrates a scenario, on which we evaluate later our learning algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "16">Assume a user would like to retrieve information about a target concept such as nausea.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "17">We can extract the set of propositions where nausea is an argument automatically from a corprus, and learn an entailment graph over propositional templates derived from the extracted propositions, as illustrated in Figure 1, left.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "18">Then, we follow the steps in the process described in Section 3: merge synonymous nodes that are in the same strong connectivity component, and turn the resulting DAG into a predicate hierarchy, which we can then use to present the propositions (Figure 1, right).</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "19">Note that in all propositional templates one argument is the target concept (nausea), and the other is a variable whose corpus instantiations can be presented according to another hierarchy (e.g. Nabilone and Lorazepam are types of drugs).</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "20">Moreover, new propositions are inferred from the graph by transitivity.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "21">For example, from the proposition ‘relaxation reduces nausea’ we can in fer the proposition ‘relaxation helps with nausea’.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "22">4.1 Focused entailment graphs.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "23">The application presented above generates entail procedure used by Lin and Pantel (2001).</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "24">However, we only consider templates containing a predicate term and arguments3.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "25">The arguments are replaced with variables, resulting in propositional ment graphs of a specific form: (1) Propositional templates such as X subj obj templates have exactly one argument instantiated by the same entity (e.g. nausea).</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "26">(2) The predicate sense is unspecified, but due to the rather small number of nodes and the instantiating argument, each predicate corresponds to a unique sense.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "27">Generalizing this notion, we define a focused entailment graph to be an entailment graph where the number of nodes is relatively small (and consequently paths in the graph are short), and predicates have a single sense (so transitivity is maintained without sense specification).</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "28">Section 5 presents an algorithm that given the set of nodes of a focused entailment graph learns its edges, i.e., the entailment relations between all pairs of nodes.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "29">The algorithm is evaluated in Section 6 using our proposed application.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "30">For brevity, from now on the term entailment graph will stand for focused entailment graph.</S>

	<SECTION title="Learning Entailment Graph Edges. " number = "5">
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "1">In this section we present an algorithm for learning the edges of an entailment graph given its set of nodes.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "2">The first step is preprocessing: We use a large corpus and WordNet to train an entail- ment classifier that estimates the likelihood that one propositional template entails another.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "3">Next, we can learn on the fly for any input graph: given the graph nodes, we employ a global optimization approach that determines the set of edges that maximizes the probability (or score) of the entire graph, given the edge probabilities (or scores) supplied by the entailment classifier and the graph constraints (transitivity and others).</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "4">5.1 Training an entailment classifier.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "5">We describe a procedure for learning an entail- ment classifier, given a corpus and a lexicographic resource (WordNet).</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "6">First, we extract a large set of propositional templates from the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "7">Next, we represent each pair of propositional templates with a feature vector of various distributional similarity scores.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "8">Last, we use WordNet to automatically generate a training set and train a classifier.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "9">Template extraction We parse the corpus with ←− affect −→ Y. Distributional similarity representation We aim to train a classifier that for an input template pair (t1, t2) determines whether t1 entails t2.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "10">A template pair is represented by a feature vector where each coordinate is a different distributional similarity score.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "11">There are a myriad of distributional similarity algorithms.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "12">We briefly describe those used in this paper, obtained through variations along the following dimensions: Predicate representation Most algorithms measure the similarity between templates with two variables (binary templates) such as X subj affect obj Y (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Bhagat et al., 2007; Yates and Etzioni, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "13">Szpketor and Dagan (2008) suggested learning over templates with subjone variable (unary templates) such as X ←− af fect, and using them to estimate a score for binary templates.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "14">Feature representation The features of a template are some representation of the terms that in- stantiated the argument variables in a corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "15">Two representations are used in our experiment (see Section 6).</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "16">Another variant occurs when using binary templates: a template may be represented by a pair of feature vectors, one for each variable (Lin and Pantel, 2001), or by a single vector, where features represent pairs of instantiations (Szpektor et al., 2004; Yates and Etzioni, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "17">The former variant reduces sparsity problems, while Yates and Etzioni showed the latter is more informative and performs favorably on their data.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "18">Similarity function We consider two similarity functions: The Lin (2001) similarity measure, and the Balanced Inclusion (BInc) similarity measure (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "19">The former is a symmetric measure and the latter is asymmetric.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "20">Therefore, information about the direction of entailment is provided by the BInc measure.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "21">We then generate for any (t1, t2) features that are the 12 distributional similarity scores using all combinations of the dimensions.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "22">This is reminiscent of Connor and Roth (2007), who used the output of unsupervised classifiers as features for a supervised classifier in a verb disambiguation task.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "23">a dependency parser and extract all propositional templates from every parse tree, employing the 3 Via a simple heuristic, omitted due to space limitations.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "24">Training set generation Following the spirit of Snow et al.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "25">(2005), WordNet is used to automatically generate a training set of positive (entailing) and negative (non-entailing) template pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "26">Let T be the set of propositional templates extractedfrom the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "27">For each ti ∈ T with two vari ables and a single predicate word w, we extract from WordNet the set H of direct hypernyms and synonyms of w. For every h ∈ H , we generate a strong evidence that one does not entail the other and so we add the constraint Iuv = 0.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "28">Combined with the constraint of transitivity this implies that there must be no path from u to v. This is done in the following two scenarios: (1) When two nodes u and v are identical except for a pair of words wu and wv , and wu is an antonym of wv , or a hyper nym of wv at distance ≥ 2.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "29">(2) When two nodes u and v are transitive opposites, that is, if u = new template tj from ti by replacing w with h. If subj X obj obj subjtj ∈ T , we consider (ti, tj ) to be a positive exam ←− w −→ Y and v = X for any word w4.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "30">←− w − → Y , ple.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "31">Negative examples are generated analogously, by looking at direct cohyponyms of w instead of hypernyms and synonyms.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "32">This follows the notion of “contrastive estimation” (Smith and Eisner, 2005), since we generate negative examples that are semantically similar to positive examples and thus focus the classifier’s attention on identifying the boundary between the classes.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "33">Last, we filter training examples for which all features are zero,and sample an equal number of positive and neg Score-based target function We assume an entailment classifier estimating a positive score Suv if it believes Iuv = 1 and a negative score otherwise (for example, an SVM classifier).</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "34">We look for a graph G that maximizes the sum of scores over the edges: Gˆ = argmax S(G) G ative examples (for which we compute similarity   features), since classifiers tend to perform poorly on the minority class when trained on imbalanced data (Van Hulse et al., 2007; Nikulin, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "35">5.2 Global learning of edges.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "36">Once the entailment classifier is trained we learn the graph edges given its nodes.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "37">This is equivalent to learning all entailment relations between all propositional template pairs for that graph.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "38">To learn edges we consider global constraints, which allow only certain graph topologies.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "39">Since we seek a global solution under transitivity and other constraints, linear programming is a natural choice, enabling the use of state of the art optimization packages.</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "40">We describe two formulations of integer linear programs that learn the edges: one maximizing a global score function, and another maximizing a global probability function.</S>
			<S sid ="133" ssid = "41">Let Iuv be an indicator denoting the event that node u entails node v. Our goal is to learn the edges E over a set of nodes V . We start by formulating the constraints and then the target functions.</S>
			<S sid ="134" ssid = "42">The first constraint is that the graph must respect transitivity.</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "43">Our formulation is equivalent to the one suggested by Finkel and Manning (2008) in a coreference resolution task: ∀u,v,w∈V Iuv + Ivw − Iuw ≤ 1 In addition, for a few pairs of nodes we have = argmax ) Suv Iuv  − λ|E| G u/=v where λ|E| is a regularization term reflecting the fact that edges are sparse.</S>
			<S sid ="136" ssid = "44">Note that this constant needs to be optimized on a development set.</S>
			<S sid ="137" ssid = "45">Probabilistic target function Let Fuv be the features for the pair of nodes (u, v) and F =∪u/=v Fuv . We assume an entailment classifier es timating the probability of an edge given its features: Puv = P (Iuv = 1|Fuv ).</S>
			<S sid ="138" ssid = "46">We look for the graph G that maximizes the posterior probability P (G|F ): Gˆ = argmax P (G|F ) G Following Snow et al., we make two independence assumptions: First, we assume each set of features Fuv is independent of other sets of features given the graph G, i.e., P (F |G) = u/=v P (Fuv |G).</S>
			<S sid ="139" ssid = "47">Second, we assume the features for the pair (u, v) are generated by a distribution depending only on whether entailment holds for (u, v).</S>
			<S sid ="140" ssid = "48">Thus, P (Fuv |G) = P (Fuv |Iuv ).</S>
			<S sid ="141" ssid = "49">Last, for simplicity we assume edges are independent and the prior probability of a graph is a product of the prior probabilities of the edge indicators: 4 We note that in some rare cases transitive verbs are indeed reciprocal, as in “X marry Y”, but in the grand majority of cases reciprocal activities are not expressed using a transitive-verb structure.</S>
			<S sid ="142" ssid = "50">P (G) = Tu/=v P (Iuv ).</S>
			<S sid ="143" ssid = "51">Note that although we assume edges are independent, dependency is still expressed using the transitivity constraint.</S>
			<S sid ="144" ssid = "52">We express P (G|F ) using the assumptions above and Bayes rule: P (G|F ) ∝ P (G)P (F |G) = n [P (Iuv )P (Fuv |Iuv )] large taxonomy (WordNet) and therefore utilize a greedy algorithm, while we simultaneously learn all edges of a rather small graph and employ integer linear programming, which is more sound theoretically, and as shown in Section 6, leads to an optimal solution.</S>
			<S sid ="145" ssid = "53">Nevertheless, Snow et al.’s model can also be formulated as a linear program with the following target function: u/=v = n P (Iuv ) u/=v P (Iuv |Fuv )P (Fuv ) P (Iuv ) argmax G ) u=/ v log Puv · P (Iuv = 0) (1 − Puv ) · P (Iuv = 1) Iuv n ∝ u/=v P (Iuv |Fuv ) Note that if the prior inverse odds k = P (Iuv =1) = 1, i.e., P (Iuv = 1) = 0.5, then this is equivalent to our probabilistic formulation.</S>
			<S sid ="146" ssid = "54">= n (u,v)∈E Puv · n (u,v)∈/E (1 − Puv ) We implemented Snow et al’s model and optimization algorithm and in Section 6.3 we compare our Note that the prior P (Fuv ) is constant with respect to the graph.</S>

			<S sid ="159" ssid = "12">We annotated all nouns and noun phrases that are in the UMLS with their possibly multiple CUIs.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "13">We extracted all propositional templates from the corpus, where both argument instantiations are medical concepts, i.e., annotated with aCUI (∼50,000 templates).</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "14">When computing distributional similarity scores, a template is repre sented as a feature vector of the CUIs that instantiate its arguments.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "15">To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we constructed 23 gold standard entailment graphs.</S>

			<S sid ="174" ssid = "27">The graphs learned by our algorithm were evaluated by two measures, one evaluating the graph directly, and the other motivated by our application: (1) F1 of the learned edges compared to the gold standard edges (2) Our application provides a summary of propositions extracted from the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="175" ssid = "28">Note that we infer new propositions by propagating inference transitively through the graph.</S>

			<S sid ="183" ssid = "36">In addition, we obtained similarity lists learned by Lin and Pantel (2001), and replicated 3 similarity measures learned by Szpektor and Dagan (2008), over the RCV1 corpus7.</S>
			<S sid ="184" ssid = "37">For each distributional similarity measure (altogether 16 measures), we learned a graph by inserting any edge (u, v), when u is in the top K templates most similar to v. We also omitted edges for which there was strong evidence that they do not exist, as specified by the constraints in Section 5.2.</S>
			<S sid ="185" ssid = "38">Another local resource was Word- Net where we inserted an edge (u, v) when v was a direct hypernym or synonym of u. For all algorithms, we added all edges inferred by transitivity.</S>

			<S sid ="196" ssid = "49">Hence, our score-based LP (tuned-LP), where the parameter λ is tuned, is on the left, and the probabilistic LP (untunedLP) is on the right.</S>

			<S sid ="199" ssid = "52">We omit Snow et al.’s formulation, since the optimal prior inverse odds k was almost exactly 1, which conflates with untunedLP.</S>
			<S sid ="200" ssid = "53">The rows Local1 and Local2 present the best distributional similarity resources.</S>
			<S sid ="201" ssid = "54">Local1 is achieved using binary templates, the Lin function, and a single vector with feature pairs.</S>

			<S sid ="204" ssid = "57">Results on the left were achieved by optimizing the top-K parameter on the development set, and on the right by optimizing on the training set automatically generated from Word- Net.</S>

			<S sid ="206" ssid = "59">To further establish the merits of global algorithms, we compare (Table 2) tuned-LP, the bestglobal algorithm, with Local∗, the best local al gorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="207" ssid = "60">The table considers all edges where the two algorithms disagree, and counts how many are in the gold standard and how many are not.</S>
			<S sid ="208" ssid = "61">Clearly, tuned-LP is superior at avoiding wrong edges (false positives).</S>
			<S sid ="209" ssid = "62">This is because tuned- LP refrains from adding edges that subsequently induce many undesirable edges through transitivity.</S>
			<S sid ="210" ssid = "63">Figures 2 and 3 illustrate this by compar ing tuned-LP and Local∗ on a subgraph of the Headache concept, before adding missing edges to satisfy transitivity to Local∗ .

			<S sid ="214" ssid = "67">This is the type of global consideration that is addressed in an ILP formulation, but is ignored in a local approach and often overlooked when employing a greedy algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="215" ssid = "68">Figure 2 also illustrates the utility of a local entailment graph for information presentation.</S>
			<S sid ="216" ssid = "69">Presenting information according to this subgraph distinguishes between propositions dealing with headache treatments and propositions dealing with headache risk groups.</S>
			<S sid ="217" ssid = "70">Comparing our use of an ILP algorithm to the greedy one reveals that tuned-LP significantly outperforms its greedy counterpart on both measures (p&lt;.01).</S>
			<S sid ="218" ssid = "71">However, untunedLP is practically equivalent to its greedy counterpart.</S>
			<S sid ="219" ssid = "72">This indicates that in this experiment the greedy algorithm provides a good approximation for the optimal solution achieved by our LP formulation.</S>
			<S sid ="220" ssid = "73">Last, when comparing WordNet to local distributional similarity methods, we observe low recall and high precision, as expected.</S>
			<S sid ="221" ssid = "74">However, global methods achieve much higher recall than WordNet while maintaining comparable precision.</S>
			<S sid ="222" ssid = "75">The results clearly demonstrate that a global approach improves performance on the entailment graph learning task, and the overall advantage of employing an ILP solver rather than a greedy algorithm.</S>
