			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Relation extraction aims at discovering semantic relations between entities.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">It is an important task that has many applications in answering factoid questions, building knowledge bases and improving search engine relevance.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">The web has become a massive potential source of such relations.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">However, its open nature brings an open-ended set of relation types.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">To extract these relations, a system should not assume a fixed set of relation types, nor rely on a fixed set of relation argument types.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">The past decade has seen some promising solutions, unsupervised relation extraction (URE) algorithms that extract relations from a corpus without knowing the relations in advance.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">However, most algorithms (Hasegawa et al., 2004, Shinyama and Sekine, 2006, Chen et.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">al, 2005) rely on tagging predefined types of entities as relation arguments, and thus are not well-suited for the open domain.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Recently, Kok and Domingos (2008) proposed Semantic Network Extractor (SNE), which generates argument semantic classes and sets of synonymous relation phrases at the same time, thus avoiding the requirement of tagging relation argu ments of predefined types.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">However, SNE has 2 limitations: 1) Following previous URE algorithms, it only uses features from the set of input relation instances for clustering.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Empirically we found that it fails to group many relevant relation instances.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">These features, such as the surface forms of arguments and lexical sequences in between, are very sparse in practice.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">In contrast, there exist several well-known corpus-level semantic resources that can be automatically derived from a source corpus and are shown to be useful for generating the key elements of a relation: its 2 argument semantic classes and a set of synonymous phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">For example, semantic classes can be derived from a source corpus with contextual distributional similarity and web table co-occurrences.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">The “synony- my” 1 problem for clustering relation instances * Work done during an internship at Microsoft Research Asia 1027 Proceedings of the 2012 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning, pages 1027–1037, Jeju Island, Korea, 12–14 July 2012.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Qc 2012 Association for Computational Linguistics could potentially be better solved by adding these resources.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">2) SNE assumes that each entity or relation phrase belongs to exactly one cluster, thus is not able to effectively handle polysemy of relation phrases2.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">An example of a polysemous phrase is be the currency of as in 2 triples &lt;Euro, be the currency of, Germany&gt; and &lt;authorship, be the currency of, science&gt;.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">As the target corpus expands from mostly news to the open web, polysemy becomes more important as input covers a wider range of domains.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">In practice, around 22% (section 3) of relation phrases are polysemous.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">Failure to handle these cases significantly limits its effectiveness.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">To move towards a more general treatment of the polysemy and synonymy problems, we present a novel algorithm WEBRE for open-domain large- scale unsupervised relation extraction without predefined relation or argument types.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">The contribu tions are: • WEBRE incorporates a wide range of corpus-level semantic resources for improving relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">The effectiveness of each knowledge source and their combination are studied and compared.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to combine and compare them for unsupervised relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">• WEBRE explicitly disambiguates polysemous relation phrases and groups synonymous phrases, thus fundamentally it avoids the limitation of previous methods.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">• Experiments on the Clueweb09 dataset (lemurproject.org/clueweb09.php) show that WEBRE is effective and efficient.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">We present a large-scale evaluation and show that WEBRE can extract a very large set of high-quality relations.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">Compared to the closest prior work, WEBRE significantly improves recall while maintaining the same level of precision.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "40">WEBRE is efficient.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "41">To the best of our knowledge, it handles the largest triple set to date (7-fold larger than largest previous effort).</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "42">Taking 14.7 million triples as input, a complete run with one CPU core takes about a day.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "43">1 We use the term synonymy broadly as defined in Section 3..</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "44">the phrase cluster for 2 different relations in SNE.</S>

			<S sid ="46" ssid = "1">Unsupervised relation extraction (URE) algorithms (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005; Shinya- ma and Sekine, 2006) collect pairs of co-occurring entities as relation instances, extract features for instances and then apply unsupervised clustering techniques to find the major relations of a corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "2">These UREs rely on tagging a predefined set of argument types, such as Person, Organization, and Location, in advance.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "3">Yao et al. 2011 learns fine- grained argument classes with generative models, but they share the similar requirement of tagging coarse-grained argument types.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "4">Most UREs use a quadratic clustering algorithm such as Hierarchical Agglomerate Clustering (Hasegawa et al., 2004, Shinyama and Sekine, 2006), K-Means (Chen et al., 2005), or both (Rosenfeld and Feldman, 2007); thus they are not scalable to very large corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "5">As the target domain shifts to the web, new methods are proposed without requiring predefined entity types.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "6">Resolver (Yates and Etzioni, 2007) resolves objects and relation synonyms.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "7">Kok and Domingos (2008) proposed Semantic Network Extractor (SNE) to extract concepts and relations.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "8">Based on second-order Markov logic, SNE used a bottom-up agglomerative clustering algorithm to jointly cluster relation phrases and argument entities.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "9">However, both Resolver and SNE require each entity and relation phrase to belong to exactly one cluster.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "10">This limits their ability to handle polysemous relation phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "11">Moreover, SNE only uses features in the input set of relation instances for clustering, thus it fails to group many relevant instances.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "12">Resolver has the same sparseness problem but it is not affected as much as SNE because of its different goal (synonym resolution).</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "13">As the preprocessing instance-detection step for the problem studied in this paper, open IE extracts relation instances (in the form of triples) from the open domain (Etzioni et al., 2004; Banko et al., 2007; Fader et al., 2011; Wang et al. 2011).</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "14">For efficiency, they only use shallow features.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "15">Reverb (Fader et al., 2011) is a state-of-the-art open domain extractor that targets verb-centric relations, which have been shown in Banko and Etzioni (2008) to cover over 70% of open domain rela tions.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "16">Taking their output as input, algorithms have been proposed to resolve objects and relation synonyms (Resolver), extract semantic networks (SNE), and map extracted relations into an existing ontology (Soderland and Mandhani, 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "17">Recent work shows that it is possible to construct semantic classes and sets of similar phrases automatically with data-driven approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "18">For generating semantic classes, previous work applies distributional similarity (Pasca, 2007; Pantel et al., 2009), uses a few linguistic patterns (Pasca 2004; Sarmento et al., 2007), makes use of structure in webpages (Wang and Cohen 2007, 2009), or combines all of them (Shi et al., 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "19">Pennacchiotti and Pantel (2009) combines several sources and features.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "20">To find similar phrases, there are 2 close The first problem is the polysemy of relation phrases, which means that a relation phrase ctx can express different relations in different triples.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "21">For example, the meaning of be the currency of in the following two triples is quite different: &lt;Euro, be the currency of, Germany&gt; and &lt;authorship, be the currency of, science&gt;.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "22">It is more appropriate to assign these 2 triples to 2 relations “a currency is the currency of a country” and “a factor is important in an area” than to merge them into one.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "23">Formally, a relation phrase ctx is polysemous if there exist 2 different relations &lt; ��1 , ��, ��2 &gt; and &lt; 𝐶 ′, ��′, 𝐶 ′ &gt; where 𝑐𝑡𝑥 ∈ 𝑃 ∩ ��′.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "24">In the previ ly related tasks: paraphrase discovery and recog1 2 nizing textual entailment.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "25">Data-driven paraphrase discovery methods (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pasca and Dienes, 2005; Wu and Zhou, 2003; Sekine, 2005) extends the idea of distributional similarity to phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "26">The Recognizing Textual Entailment algorithms (Berant et al. 2011) can also be used to find related phrases since they find pairs of phrases in which one entails the other.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "27">To efficiently cluster high-dimensional datasets, canopy clustering (McCallum et al., 2000) uses a cheap, approximate distance measure to divide data into smaller subsets, and then cluster each subset using an exact distance measure.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "28">It has been applied to reference matching.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "29">The second phase of WEBRE applies the similar high-level idea of partition-then-cluster for speeding up relation clustering.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "30">We design a graph-based partitioning subroutine that uses various types of evidence, such as shared hypernyms.</S>

			<S sid ="76" ssid = "1">The basic input is a collection of relation instances (triples) of the form &lt;ent1, ctx, ent2&gt;.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "2">For each triple, ctx is a relational phrase expressing the relation between the first argument ent1 and the second argument ent2.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "3">An example triple is &lt;Obama, win in, NY&gt;.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "4">The triples can be generated by an open IE extractor such as TextRunner or Reverb.</S>

			<S sid ="84" ssid = "9">ous example, be the currency of is polysemous because it appears in 2 different relations.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "10">Polysemy of relation phrases is not uncommon.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "11">We generate clusters from a large sample of triples with the assistance of a soft clustering algorithm, and found that around 22% of relation phrases can be put into at least 2 disjoint clusters that represent different relations.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "12">More importantly, manual inspection reveals that some common phrases are polysemous.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "13">For example, be part of can be put into a relation “a city is located in a country” when connecting Cities to Countries, and another relation “a company is a subsidiary of a parent company” when connecting Companies to Companies.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "14">Failure to handle polysemous relation phrases fundamentally limits the effectiveness of an algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "15">The WEBRE algorithm described later explicitly handles polysemy and synonymy of relation phrases in its first and second phase respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "16">The second problem is the “synonymy” of relation instances.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "17">We use the term synonymy broadly and we say 2 relation instances are synonymous if they express the same semantic relation between the same pair of semantic classes.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "18">For example, both &lt;Euro, be the currency used in, Germany&gt; and &lt;Dinar, be legal tender in, Iraq&gt; express the relation &lt;Currencies, be currency of, Countries&gt;.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "19">Solving this problem requires grouping synonymous relation phrases and identifying argument semantic classes for the relation.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "20">Various knowledge sources can be derived from the source corpus for this purpose.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "21">In this paper we pay special attention to incorporating various semantic resources for relation extraction.</S>

			<S sid ="102" ssid = "1">We first describe relevant knowledge sources, and then introduce the WEBRE algorithm, followed by a briefly analysis on its computational complexity.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "2">4.1 Knowledge Sources.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "3">Entity similarity graph We build two similarity graphs for entities: a distributional similarity (DS) graph and a pattern-similarity (PS) graph.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "4">The DS graph is based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1985), saying that terms sharing similar contexts tend to be similar.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "5">We use a text window of size 4 as the context of a term, use Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to weight context features, and use Jaccard similarity to measure the similarity of term vectors.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "6">The PS graph is generated by adopting both sentence lexical patterns and HTML tag patterns (Hearst, 1992; Kozareva et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "7">Two terms (T) tend to be semantically similar if they co- occur in multiple patterns.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "8">One example of sentence lexical patterns is (such as | including) T{,T}* (and|,|.).</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "9">HTML tag patterns include tables, dropdown boxes, etc. In these two graphs, nodes are entities and the edge weights indicate entity similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "10">In all there are about 29.6 million nodes and 1.16 billion edges.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "11">Hypernymy graph Hypernymy relations are very useful for finding semantically similar term pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "12">For example, we observed that a small city in UK and another small city in Germany share common hypernyms such as city, location, and place.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "13">Therefore the similarity between the two cities is large according to the hypernymy graph, while their similarity in the DS graph and the PS graph may be very small.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "14">Following existing work (Hearst, 1992, Pantel &amp; Ravichandran 2004; Snow et al., 2005; Talukdar et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011), we adopt a list of lexical patterns to extract hypernyms.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "15">The patterns include NP {,} (such as) {NP,}* {and|or} NP, NP (is|are|was|were|being) (a|an|the) NP, etc. The hypernymy graph is a bi partite graph with two types of nodes: entity nodes and label (hypernym) nodes.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "16">There is an edge (T, L) with weight w if L is a hypernym of entity T with probability w. There are about 8.2 million nodes and 42.4 million edges in the hypernymy graph.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "17">In this paper, we use the terms hypernym and label interchangeably.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "18">Relation phrase similarity: To generate the pairwise similarity graph for relation phrases with regard to the probability of expressing the same relation, we apply a variant of the DIRT algorithm (Lin and Pantel, 2001).</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "19">Like DIRT, the paraphrase discovery relies on the distributional hypothesis, but there are a few differences: 1) we use stemmed lexical sequences (relation phrases) instead of dependency paths as phrase candidates because of the very large scale of the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "20">2) We used ordered pairs of arguments as features of phrases while DIRT uses them as independent features.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "21">We empirically tested both feature schemes and found that using ordered pairs results in likely paraphrases but using independent features the result contains general inference rules4.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "22">4.2 WEBRE for Relation Extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "23">WEBRE consists of two phases.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "24">In the first phase, a set of semantic classes are discovered and used as argument classes for each relation phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "25">This results in a large collection of relations whose arguments are pairs of semantic classes and which have exactly one relation phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "26">We call these relations the Type A relations.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "27">An example Type A relation is &lt;{New York, London…}, be locate in, {USA, England, …}&gt;.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "28">During this phase, polysemous relation phrases are disambiguated and placed into multiple Type A relations.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "29">The second phase is an efficient algorithm which groups similar Type A relations together.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "30">This step enriches the argument semantic classes and groups synonymous relation phrases to form relations with multiple expressions, which we called Type B relations.</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "31">Both Type A and Type B relations are system outputs since both are valuable resources for downstream applications such as QA and Web Search.</S>
			<S sid ="133" ssid = "32">An overview of the algorithm is shown in Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="134" ssid = "33">Here we first briefly describe a clustering subroutine that is used in both phases, and then describe the algorithm in detail.</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "34">To handle polysemy of objects (e.g., entities or relations) during the clustering procedure, a key building block is an effective Multi-Membership Clustering algorithm (MMClustering).</S>
			<S sid ="136" ssid = "35">For simplicity and effectiveness, we use a variant of Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), in which we first cluster objects with HAC, and then reassign each object to additional clusters when its similarities with these clusters exceed a certain threshold5.</S>
			<S sid ="137" ssid = "36">In the remainder of this paper, we use {C} = MMClustering({object}, SimFunc, α) to represent running MMClustering over a set of objects, 4 For example, be part of has ordered argument pairs &lt;A, B&gt;.</S>

			<S sid ="139" ssid = "38">If arguments are used as independent features, these two phrases shared the same set of features {A,B, C, D}.</S>
			<S sid ="140" ssid = "39">However, they are inferential (complement relation ship) rather than being similar phrases.</S>

			<S sid ="335" ssid = "195">For example, SNE placed be part of in the phrase cluster be city of and failed to place it in another cluster be subsidiary of.</S>
			<S sid ="336" ssid = "196">This limits SNE’s ability to placing relation instances with polysemous phrases into correct relation clusters.</S>
			<S sid ="337" ssid = "197">It should be emphasized that we use pairwise precision and recall in table 4 to be consistent with the original SNE paper.</S>
			<S sid ="338" ssid = "198">Pairwise metrics are much more sensitive than instance-level metrics, and penalize recall exponentially in the worst case11 if an algorithm incorrectly splits a coherent cluster; therefore the absolute pairwise recall difference 11 Pairwise precision and recall are calculated on all pairs that.</S>
			<S sid ="339" ssid = "199">are in the same cluster, thus are very sensitive.</S>
			<S sid ="340" ssid = "200">For example, if an algorithm incorrectly split a cluster of size N to a smaller main cluster of size N/2 and some constant-size clusters, pairwise recall could drop to as much as ¼ of its original value.</S>
			<S sid ="341" ssid = "201">should not be interpreted as the same as the instance-level recall reported in previous experiments.</S>
			<S sid ="342" ssid = "202">On 1 million triples, WEBRE generates 12179 triple clusters with an average size12 of 13 while SNE generate 53270 clusters with an average size 5.1.</S>
			<S sid ="343" ssid = "203">In consequence, pairwise recall drops significantly.</S>
			<S sid ="344" ssid = "204">Nonetheless, at above 80% pairwise precision, it demonstrates that WEBRE can group more related triples by adding rich semantics har vested from the web and employing a more general treatment of polysemous relation phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="345" ssid = "205">On 1M triples, WEBRE finished in 40 minutes, while the run time of SNE varies from 3 hours to a few days.</S>
