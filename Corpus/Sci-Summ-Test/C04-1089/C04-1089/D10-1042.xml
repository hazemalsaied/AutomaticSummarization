			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Entity translation aims at mapping the entity names (e.g., people, locations, and organizations) in source language into their corresponding names in target language.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">While high quality entity translation is essential in cross-lingual information access and trans lation, it is nontrivial to achieve, due to the challenge that entity translation, though typically bearing pronunciation similarity, can also be arbitrary, e.g., Jackie Chan and fiX :it (pronounced Cheng Long).</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Existing efforts to address these challenges can be categorized into transliteration- and corpus- based approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Transliteration-based approaches (Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Knight and Graehl, 1998) identify translations based on pronunciation similarity, while corpus-based approaches mine bilingual co-occurrences of translation pairs obtained from parallel (Kupiec, 1993; Feng et al., 2004) or comparable (Fung and Yee, 1998) corpora, or alternatively mined from bilingual sentences (Lin et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">These two approaches have complementary strength– transliteration-based similarity can be computed for any name pair but cannot mine translations of little (or none) phonetic similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Corpus-based similarity can support arbitrary translations, but require highly scarce resources of bilingual co-occurrences, obtained from parallel or comparable bilingual corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">In this paper, we propose a holistic approach, leveraging both transliteration- and corpus-based similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Our key contribution is to replace the use of scarce resources of bilingual co-occurrences with the use of untapped and significantly larger resources of monolingual co-occurrences for translation.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">In particular, we extract monolingual co- occurrences of entities from English and Chinese Web corpora, which are readily available from entity search engines such as PeopleEntityCube1, deployed by Microsoft Research Asia.</S>

			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Qc 2010 Association for Computational Linguistics automatically extracts people names from text and their co-occurrences to retrieve related entities based on co-occurrences.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">To illustrate, Figure 1(a) demonstrates the query result for “Bill Gates,” retrieving and visualizing the “entity-relationship graph” of related people names that frequently co-occur with Bill in English corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">Similarly, entity-relationship graphs can be built over other language corpora, as Figure 1(b) demonstrates the corresponding results for the same query, from Renlifang2 on Chinese Web corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">From this point on, for the sake of simplicity, we refer to English and Chinese graphs, simply 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 Tail Head Ours Google Engkoo as Ge and Gc respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Though we illustrate with EnglishChinese pairs in the paper, our method can be easily adapted to other language pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">In particular, we propose a novel approach of abstracting entity translation as a graph matching problem of two graphs Ge and Gc in Figures 1(a) and (b).</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Specifically, the similarity between two nodes ve and vc in Ge and Gc is initialized as their transliteration similarity, which is iteratively refined based on relational similarity obtained from monolingual co- occurrences.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">To illustrate this, an English news article mentioning “Bill Gates” and “Melinda Gates” evidences a relationship between the two entities, which can be quantified from their co-occurrences in the entire English Web corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">Similarly, we can mine Chinese news articles to obtain the re lationships between “t )];·Jli Vi” and “1&apos;1 li\ it·Jli Vi”.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Once these two bilingual graphs of people and their relationships are harvested, entity translation can leverage these parallel relationships to further evidence the mapping between translation pairs, as Figure 1(c) illustrates.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">To highlight the advantage of our proposed approach, we compare our results with commercial machine translators (1) Engkoo3 developed in Microsoft Research Asia and (2) Google Translator4.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">In particular, Figure 2 reports the precision for two groups– “heads” that belong to top-100 popular people (determined by the number of hits), among randomly sampled 304 people names5 from six graph pairs of size 1,000 each, and the remaining “tails”.</S>

			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">Figure 2: Comparison for Head and Tail datasets bilingual co-occurrences that are scarce for tails, show significantly lower precision for tails.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">Meanwhile, our work, depending solely on monolingual co-occurrences, shows high precision, for both heads and tails.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">Our focus is to boost translation accuracy for long tails with nontrivial Web occurrences in each monolingual corpus, but not with much bilingual co- occurrences, e.g., researchers publishing actively in two languages but not famous enough to be featured in multilingual Wikipedia entries or news articles.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">As existing translators are already highly accurate for popular heads, this focus well addresses the remaining challenges for entity translation.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">To summarize, we believe that this paper has the following contributions: • We abstract entity translation problem as a graph mapping between entity-relationship graphs in two languages.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">• We develop an effective matching algorithm leveraging both pronunciation and co- occurrence similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">This holistic approach complements existing approaches and en hances the translation coverage and accuracy.</S>

			<S sid ="46" ssid = "1">In this section, we first survey related efforts, categorized into transliteration-based and corpus-based approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "2">Our approach leveraging both is complementary to these efforts.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "3">2.1 Transliteration-based Approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "4">Many name translations are loosely based on phonetic similarity, which naturally inspires transliteration-based translation of finding the translation with the closest pronunciation similarity, using either rule-based (Wan and Verspoor, 1998) or statistical (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Li et al., 2004) approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "5">However, people are free to designate arbitrary bilingual names of little (or none) phonetic similarity, for which the transliteration-based approach is not effective.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "6">2.2 Corpus-based Approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "7">Corpus-based approach can mine arbitrary translation pairs, by mining bilingual co-occurrences from parallel and comparable bilingual corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "8">Using parallel corpora (Kupiec, 1993; Feng et al., 2004), e.g., bilingual Wikipedia entries on the same person, renders high accuracy but suffers from high scarcity.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "9">To alleviate such scarcity, (Fung and Yee, 1998; Shao and Ng, 2004) explore a more vast resource of comparable corpora, which share no parallel document- or sentence-alignments as in parallel corpora but describe similar contents in two languages, e.g., news articles on the same event.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "10">Alternatively, (Lin et al., 2008) extracts bilingual co- occurrences from bilingual sentences, such as annotating terms with their corresponding translations in English inside parentheses.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "11">Similarly, (Jiang et al., 2009) identifies potential translation pairs from bilingual sentences using lexical pattern analysis.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "12">2.3 Holistic Approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "13">The complementary strength of the above two approaches naturally calls for a holistic approach, such as recent work combining transliteration- and corpus-based similarity mining bilingual co- occurrences using general search engines.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "14">Specifically, (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002) uses transliteration to generate candidates and then web corpora to identify translations.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "15">Later, (Jiang et al., 2007) enhances to use transliteration to guide web mining.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "16">Our work is also a holistic approach, but leveraging significantly larger corpora, specifically by exploiting monolingual co-occurrences.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "17">Such expansion enables to translate “long-tail” people entities with nontrivial Web occurrences in each monolingual corpus, but not much bilingual co-occurrences.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "18">Specifically, we initialize name pair similarity using transliteration-based approach, and iteratively reinforces base similarity using relational similarity.</S>

			<S sid ="67" ssid = "4">We initialize the translation similarity Rij as the transliteration similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "5">This section explains how to get the transliteration similarity between English and Chinese names using an unsupervised approach.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "6">Formally, let an English name Ne = (e1, e2, · · · , en) and a Chinese name Nc = (c1 , c2, · · · , cm ) be given, where ei is an English word and Ne is a sequence of the words, and ci is a Chinese character and Nc is a sequence of the characters.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "7">Our goal is to compute a score indicating the similarity between the pronunciations of the two names.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "8">We first convert Nc into its Pinyin representationP Yc = (s1, s2, · · · , sm ), where si is the Pinyin representation of ci . Pinyin is the romanization rep resentation of pronunciation of Chinese character.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "9">For example, the Pinyin representation of Ne = (“Barack”, “Obama”) is P Yc =(“ba”, “la”, “ke”, “ao”, “ba”, “ma”).</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "10">The Pinyin representations of Chinese characters can be easily obtained from Chinese character pronunciation dictionary.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "11">In our experiments, we use an in-house dictionary, which contains pronunciations of 20, 774 Chinese characters.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "12">For the Chinese characters having multiple pronunciations, we only use the most popular one.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "13">Calculation of transliteration similarity between Ne and Nc is now transformed to calculation of pronunciation similarity between Ne and P Yc . Because letters in Chinese Pinyins and English strings are pronounced similarly, we can further approximate of matching node pairs such that S ⊆ Ve × Vc.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "14">Let R be a |Ve |-by-|Vc| matrix where each Rij denotes pronunciation similarity between Ne and P Ycus the similarity between two nodes i ∈ Ve and j ∈ Vc.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "15">Overall, with the matrix R, our approach consists of the following three steps, as we will discuss in the following three sections respectively: 1.</S>

			<S sid ="83" ssid = "20">In this paper, we use Edit Distance (ED) to measure the spelling similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "21">Moreover, since words in Ne are transliterated into characters in P Yc independently, it is more accurate to compute the ED between Ne and P Yc , i.e., EDname (Ne , P Yc ), as the sum of the EDs of all component transliteration pairs, i.e., every ei in Ne and its corresponding transliteration (si ) in P Yc.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "22">In other words, we need to first align all sj ’s in P Yc with corresponding ei in Ne based on whether they are translations of each other.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "23">Then based on the alignment, we can calculate EDname (Ne , P Yc) using the following formula.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "24">EDname (Ne , P Yc) = ∑ ED(ei , esi ) (1) i where esi is a string generated by concatenating all si ’s that are aligned to ei and ED(ei , esi ) is the Edit Distance between ei and esi , i.e., the minimum number of edit operations (including inser 3.2 Reinforcement Model.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "25">From the initial similarity, we model our problem as an iterative approach that iteratively reinforces the similarity Rij of the nodes i and j from the matching similarities of their neighbor nodes u and v. The basic intuition is built on exploiting the similarity between monolingual co-occurrences of two different languages.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "26">In particular, we assume two entities with strong relationship co-occur frequently in both corpora.</S>

			<S sid ="95" ssid = "32">In this neighbor EDname (N 1,i−1 1,j−3 j−2,j e , P Yc ) + ED(ei , P Yc ), matching process, if many-to-many matches exist, EDname (N 1,i−1 1,j−4 j−3,j e , P Yc ) + ED(ei , P Yc )) where, given a sequence X = (x1 , x2, · · ·) such that xi is a word, X i,j is the subsequence (xi , xi+1, · · · , xj ) of X and Len(X ) is the numberof letters except spaces in the sequence X . For in stance, the minimal Edit Distance between the English name “Barack Obama” and the Chinese Pinyin representation “ba la ke ao ba ma” is 4, as the best alignment is: “Barack” ↔ “ba la ke” (ED: 3), we select only one with the greatest matching score.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "33">Figure 3 describes such matching process more formally.</S>

			<S sid ="149" ssid = "23">This section reports our experimental results using the evaluation datasets explained in previous section.</S>
			<S sid ="150" ssid = "24">For each graph pair, we evaluated the effectiveness of (1) reinforcement model using MRR measure in Section 4.2.1 and (2) overall framework using precision, recall, and F1 measures in Section 4.2.2.</S>
			<S sid ="151" ssid = "25">We also validated (3) scalability of our framework over larger scale of graphs (with up to five thousand nodes) in Section 4.2.3.</S>

			<S sid ="153" ssid = "27">4.2.1 Effectiveness of reinforcement model We evaluated the reinforcement model over MRR (Voorhees, 2001), the average of the reciprocal ranks of the query results as the following formula: MRRs for two matrices R0 and R∞, we can validate the effectiveness of the reinforcement model.</S>

			<S sid ="157" ssid = "31">As these figures show, MRR scores significantly increase after applying our reinforcement model except for the set T4 (on average from 69% to 81%), which indirectly shows the effectiveness of our reinforcement model.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "32">4.2.2 Effectiveness of overall framework Based on the reinforced matrix, we evaluated the effectiveness of our overall matching framework using the following three measures–(1) precision: how accurately the method returns matching pairs, (2) recall: how many the method returns correct matching pairs, and (3) F1-score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "33">We compared our approach with a baseline, mapping two graphs with only transliteration similarity.</S>

			<S sid ="163" ssid = "37">As this table shows, our approach results in the highest precision (about 80% on average) without compromising the best recall of Google, i.e., 61% of Google vs. 63% of ours.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "38">Overall, our approach outperforms others in all three measures.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "39">Meanwhile, in order to validate the translation accuracy over popular head and long-tail, as discussed in Section 1, we separated the test data into two groups and analyzed the effectiveness separately.</S>

			<S sid ="168" ssid = "42">4.2.3 Scalability To validate the scalability of our approach, we evaluated the effectiveness of our approach over the number of nodes in two graphs.</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "43">We built larger six graph pairs (Ge, Gc ) by expanding them from the seed pairs further until the number of nodes reaches 5,000.</S>

			<S sid ="171" ssid = "45">Overall, the number of matched pairs linearly increases as the number of nodes increases, which suggests scalability.</S>
