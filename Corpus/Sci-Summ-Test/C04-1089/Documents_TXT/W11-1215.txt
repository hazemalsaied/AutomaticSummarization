Abstract
This paper introduces a new task of
crosslingual slot filling which aims to dis-
cover attributes for entity queries from
crosslingual comparable corpora and then
present answers in a desired language. It is
a very challenging task which suffers from
both information extraction and machine
translation errors. In this paper we ana-
lyze the types of errors produced by five
different baseline approaches, and present
a novel supervised rescoring based valida-
tion approach to incorporate global evi-
dence from very large bilingual compara-
ble corpora. Without using any additional
labeled data this new approach obtained
38.5% relative improvement in Precision
and 86.7% relative improvement in Recall
over several state-of-the-art approaches.
The ultimate system outperformed mono-
lingual slot filling pipelines built on much
larger monolingual corpora.
1 Introduction
The slot filling task at NIST TAC Knowledge
Base Population (KBP) track (Ji et al, 2010)
is a relatively new and popular task with the
goal of automatically building profiles of enti-
ties from large amounts of unstructured data,
and using these profiles to populate an existing
knowledge base. These profiles consist of nu-
merous slots such as ?title?, ?parents? for per-
sons and ?top-employees? for organizations. A
variety of approaches have been proposed to ad-
dress both tasks with considerable success; nev-
ertheless, all of the KBP tasks so far have been
limited to monolingual processing. However, as
the shrinking fraction of the world?s Web pages
are written in English, many slot fills can only
be discovered from comparable documents in
foreign languages. By comparable corpora we
mean texts that are about similar topics, but
are not in general translations of each other.
These corpora are naturally available, for ex-
ample, many news agencies release multi-lingual
news articles on the same day. In this paper we
propose a new and more challenging crosslin-
gual slot filling task, to find information for any
English query from crosslingual comparable cor-
pora, and then present its profile in English.
We developed complementary baseline ap-
proaches which combine two difficult problems:
information extraction (IE) and machine trans-
lation (MT). In this paper we conduct detailed
error analysis to understand how we can exploit
comparable corpora to construct more complete
and accurate profiles.
Many correct answers extracted from our
baselines will be reported multiple times in any
external large collection of comparable docu-
ments. We can thus take advantage of such in-
formation redundancy to rescore candidate an-
swers. To choose the best answers we consult
large comparable corpora and corresponding IE
results. We prefer those answers which fre-
quently appear together with the query in cer-
tain IE contexts, including co-occurring names,
coreference links, relations and events. For ex-
ample, we prefer ?South Korea? instead of ?New
York Stock Exchange? as the ?per:employee of ?
answer for ?Roh Moo-hyun? using global ev-
idence from employment relation extraction.
Such global knowledge from comparable corpora

provides substantial improvement over each in-
dividual baseline system and even state-of-the-
art monolingual slot filling systems. Compared
to previous methods of exploiting comparable
corpora, our approach is novel in multiple as-
pects because it exploits knowledge from: (1)
both local and global statistics; (2) both lan-
guages; and (3) both shallow and deep analysis.
2 Related Work
Sudo et al (2004) found that for a crosslin-
gual single-document IE task, source language
extraction and fact translation performed no-
tably better than machine translation and tar-
get language extraction. We observed the same
results. In addition we also demonstrate that
these two approaches are complementary and
can be used to boost each other?s results in a
statistical rescoring model with global evidence
from large comparable corpora.
Hakkani-Tur et al (2007) described a filtering
mechanism using two crosslingual IE systems
for improving crosslingual document retrieval.
Many previous validation methods for crosslin-
gual QA, such as those organized by Cross Lan-
guage Evaluation Forum (Vallin et al, 2005), fo-
cused on local information which involves only
the query and answer (e.g. (Kwork and Deng,
2006)), keyword translation (e.g. (Mitamura et
al., 2006)) and surface patterns (e.g. (Soubbotin
and Soubbotin, 2001)). Some global valida-
tion approaches considered information redun-
dancy based on shallow statistics including co-
occurrence, density score and mutual informa-
tion (Clarke et al, 2001; Magnini et al, 2001;
Lee et al, 2008), deeper knowledge from depen-
dency parsing (e.g. (Shen et al, 2006)) or logic
reasoning (e.g. (Harabagiu et al, 2005)). How-
ever, all of these approaches made limited efforts
at disambiguating entities in queries and limited
use of fact extraction in answer search and vali-
dation.
Several recent IE studies have stressed the
benefits of using information redundancy on
estimating the correctness of the IE out-
put (Downey et al, 2005; Yangarber, 2006;
Patwardhan and Riloff, 2009; Ji and Grish-
man, 2008). Some recent research used com-
parable corpora to re-score name translitera-
tions (Sproat et al, 2006; Klementiev and Roth,
2006) or mine new word translations (Fung and
Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Shao and Ng, 2004; Tao
and Zhai, 2005; Hassan et al, 2007; Udupa et
al., 2009; Ji, 2009). To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the first work on mining facts from
comparable corpora for answer validation in a
new crosslingual entity profiling task.
3 Experimental Setup
3.1 Task Definition
The goal of the KBP slot filling task is to extract
facts from a large source corpus regarding cer-
tain attributes (?slots?) of an entity, which may
be a person or organization, and use these facts
to augment an existing knowledge base (KB).
Along with each slot answer, the system must
provide the ID of a document which supports
the correctness of this answer. KBP 2010 (Ji et
al., 2010) defines 26 types of attributes for per-
sons (such as the age, birthplace, spouse, chil-
dren, job title, and employing organization) and
16 types of attributes for organizations (such
as the top employees, the founder, the year
founded, the headquarters location, and the sub-
sidiaries).
The new problem we define in this paper is an
extension of this task to a crosslingual paradigm.
Given a query in a target language t and a col-
lection of documents in a source language s,
a system must extract slot answers about the
query and present the answers in t. In this pa-
per we examine a specific setting of s=Chinese
and t=English.
To score crosslingual slot filling, we pool all
the system responses and group equivalent an-
swers into equivalence classes. Each system re-
sponse is rated as correct, wrong, inexact or re-
dundant. Given these judgments, we calculate
the precision, recall and F-measure of each sys-
tem, crediting only correct answers.
3.2 Data and Query Selection
We use the comparable corpora of English
TDT5 (278,358 documents) and Chinese TDT5
111
(56,424 documents) as our source collection.
For query selection, we collected all the en-
tities from the entire source collection and
counted their frequencies. We then selected 50
informative entities (25 persons and 25 organiza-
tions) which were located in the middle range of
frequency counts. Among the 25 person queries,
half are Chinese-specific names, and half are
non-Chinese names. The 25 organizations fol-
low a representative distribution according to
the entity subtypes defined in NIST Automatic
Content Extraction (ACE) program1.
3.3 Baseline Pipelines
3.3.1 Overview
We employ the following two types of base-
line crosslingual slot filling pipelines to process
Chinese documents. Figure 1 and Table 1 shows
the five system pipelines we have used to con-
duct our experiments.
Type A Translate Chinese texts into English,
and apply English slot filling systems to the
translations.
Type B Translate English queries into Chinese,
apply Chinese slot filling systems to Chinese
texts, and translate answers back to English.

Filling Pipelines
3.3.2 Monolingual Slot Filling
We applied a state-of-the-art bilingual slot
filling system (Chen et al, 2010) to process
bilingual comparable corpora. This baseline
system includes a supervised ACE IE pipeline
and a bottom-up pattern matching pipeline.
The IE pipeline includes relation extraction and
event extraction based on maximum entropy
models that incorporate diverse lexical, syntac-
tic, semantic and ontological knowledge. The
extracted ACE relations and events are then
mapped to KBP slot fills. In pattern matching,
we extract and rank patterns based on a dis-
tant supervision approach (Mintz et al, 2009)
that uses entity-attribute pairs from Wikipedia
Infoboxes and Freebase (Bollacker et al, 2008).
We set a low threshold to include more answer
candidates, and then a series of filtering steps
to refine and improve the overall pipeline re-
sults. The filtering steps include removing an-
swers which have inappropriate entity types or
have inappropriate dependency paths to the en-
tities.
3.3.3 Document and Name Translation
We use a statistical, phrase-based MT sys-
tem (Zens and Ney, 2004) to translate Chinese
documents into English for Type A Approaches.
The best translation is computed by using a
weighted log-linear combination of various sta-
tistical models: an n-gram language model, a
phrase translation model and a word-based lex-
112
icon model. The latter two models are used in
source-to-target and target-to-source directions.
The model scaling factors are optimized with re-
spect to the BLEU score similar to (Och, 2003).
The training data includes 200 million running
words in each language. The total language
model training data consists of about 600 mil-
lion running words.
We applied various name mining approaches
from comparable corpora and parallel corpora,
as described in (Ji et al, 2009) to extract and
translate names in queries and answers in Type
B approaches. The accuracy of name translation
is about 88%. For those names not covered by
these pairs, we relied on Google Translate 2 to
obtain results.
4 Analysis of Baseline Pipelines
In this section we analyze the coverage (Sec-
tion 4.1) and precision (Section 4.2) results of
the baseline pipelines. We then illustrate the
potential for global validation from comparable
corpora through a series of examples.

Although crosslingual pipelines used a much
smaller corpus than monolingual pipelines, they
extracted comparable number of correct answers
(66 vs. 81) with a slightly better precision.
In fact, the crosslingual pipeline (5) performs
even better than monolingual pipeline (2), es-
pecially on the employment slots. In particu-
lar, 96.35% of the correct answers for Chinese-
specific person queries (e.g. ?Tang Jiaxuan?)
were extracted from Chinese data. Even for
those facts discovered from English data, they
are about quite general slots such as ?title? and
?employee of ?. In contrast, Chinese data covers
more diverse biographical slots such as ?family
members? and ?schools attended?.
Compared to the union of Type A approaches
(pipelines (3)+(4)), Pipeline (5) returned many
more correct answers with higher precision. The
main reason is that Type A approaches suffer
from MT errors. For example, MT mistakenly
translated the query name ?Celine Dion? into
?Clinton? and thus English slot filling compo-
nents failed to identify any answers. One can
hypothesize that slot filling on MT output can
be improved by re-training extraction compo-
nents directly from MT output. However, our
experiments of learning patterns from MT out-
put showed negative impact, mainly because
MT errors were too diverse to generalize. In
other cases even though slot filling produced cor-
rect results, MT still failed to translate the an-
swer names correctly. For example, English slot
filling successfully found a potential answer for
?org:founded by? of the query ?Microsoft? from
the following MT output: ?The third largest of
the Microsoft common founder Alan Doss , aged
50, and net assets of US 22 billion.?; however,
the answer string ?Paul Allen? was mistakenly
translated into ?Alan Doss?. MT is not so cru-
cial for ?per:title? slot because it does not require
translation of contexts.
To summarize, 59% of the missing errors were
due to text, query or answer translation errors
and 20% were due to slot filling errors. Never-
theless, the union of (3)+(4)+(5) still contain
more correct answers. These baseline pipelines
were developed from a diverse set of algorithms,
and typically showed strengths in specific slots.
113
In general we can conclude that monolin-
gual and crosslingual pipelines are complemen-
tary. Combining the responses from all baseline
pipelines, we can get similar number of correct
answers compared to one single human annota-
tor.
4.2 Precision Analysis: Toward Global
Validation
The spurious errors from baseline crosslingual
slot filling pipelines reveal both the shortcom-
ings of the MT system and extraction across
languages. Table 3 shows the distribution of
spurious errors.

Table 3: Distribution of Spurious Errors
Table 3 indicates a majority (85%) of spurious
errors from Type A pipelines were due to ap-
plying monolingual slot filling methods to MT
output which preserves Chinese structure.
As demonstrated in previous work (e.g. (Par-
ton and McKeown, 2010; Ji et al, 2009)),
we also found that many (14.6%) errors were
caused by the low quality of name translation
for queries and answers.
For example, ?????/McGinty? was mis-
takenly translated into the query name ?Kim
Jong-il?, which led to many incorrect answers
such as ?The British Royal joint military re-
search institute? for ?per:employee of ?.
In contrast, the spurious errors from Type B
pipelines were more diverse. Chinese IE com-
ponents severely suffered from word segmen-
tation errors (34%), which were then directly
propagated into Chinese document retrieval and
slot filling. Many segmentation errors occurred
with out-of-vocabulary names, especially per-
son names and nested organization names. For
example, the name ????/Yao Mingbao? was
mistakenly segmented into two words ???/Yao
Ming? and ??/bao?, and thus the document was
mistakenly retrieved for the query ?Yao Ming?.
In many cases (33%) Chinese relation and
event extraction components failed to cap-
ture Chinese-specific structures due to the lim-
ited size of training corpora. For example,
from the context ???????????????
?/Xiao Wan-chang, who were invited to be-
come the economics consultant for Chen Shui-
bian?, Chinese slot filling system mistakenly ex-
tracted ?consultant? as a ?per:title? answer for
the query ?Chen Shui-bian? using a common
pattern ?<query><title>?.
13% of errors were caused due to invalid se-
mantic types for certain slots. For example,
many metaphoric titles such as ?tough guy?
don?t match the definition of ?per:title? in the
annotation guideline ?employment or member-
ship position?.
5 Global Validation
Based on the above motivations we propose to
incorporate global evidence from a very large
collection of comparable documents to refine
local decisions. The central idea is to over-
generate candidate answers from multiple weak
baselines to ensure high upper-bound of recall,
and then conduct effective global validation to
filter spurious errors while keeping good answers
in order to enhance precision.
5.1 Supervised Rescoring
Ideally, we want to choose a validation model
which can pick out important features in a con-
text wider than that used by baseline pipelines.
Merging individual systems to form the union of
answers can be effective, but Table 2 shows that
simple union of all pipelines produced worse F-
measure than the best pipeline.
In this paper we exploit the reranking
paradigm, commonly used in information re-
trieval, to conduct global validation. By model-
ing the empirical distribution of labeled training
data, statistical models are used to identify the
114
strengths and weaknesses (e.g. high and low pre-
cision slots) of individual systems, and rescore
answers accordingly. Specially, we develop a
supervised Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) based
model to rescore the answers from the pipelines,
selecting only the highest-scoring answers.
The rescorer was trained (using cross-
validation) on varying subsets of the features.
The threshold at which an answer is deemed to
be true is chosen to maximize the F-Measure on
the training set.
5.2 Validation Features
Table 4 describes the validation features used for
rescoring, where q is the query, q? the Chinese
translation of q, t the slot type, a the candidate
answer, a? the Chinese form of a, s the context
sentence and d is the context document support-
ing a.
The feature set benefits from multiple dimen-
sions of crosslingual slot filling. These features
were applied to both languages wherever anno-
tation resources were available.
In the KBP slot filling task, slots are of-
ten dependent on each other, so we can im-
prove the results by improving the ?coherence?
of the story (i.e. consistency among all gener-
ated answers - query profiles). We use feature
f2 to check whether the same answer was gen-
erated for conflicting slots, such as per:parents
and per:children.
Compared to traditional QA tasks, slot fill-
ing is a more fine-grained task in which differ-
ent slots are expected to obtain semantically
different answers. Therefore, we explored se-
mantic constraints in both local and global con-
texts. For example, we utilized bilingual name
gazetteers from ACE training corpora, Google
n-grams (Ji and Lin, 2009) and the geonames
website 3 to encode features f6, f8 and f9; The
org:top members/employees slot requires a sys-
tem to distinguish whether a person member/
employee is in the top position, thus we encoded
f10 for this purpose.
The knowledge used in our baseline pipelines
is relatively static ? it is not updated during the
3http://www.geonames.org/statistics/
extraction process. Achieving high performance
for cross-lingual slot filling requires that we take
a broader view, one that looks outside a sin-
gle document or a single language in order to
exploit global knowledge. Fortunately, as more
and more large crosslingual comparable corpora
are available, we can take advantage of informa-
tion redundancy to validate answers. The basic
intuition is that if a candidate answer a is cor-
rect, it should appear together with the query
q repeatedly, in different documents, or even in
certain coreference links, relations and events.
For example, ?David Kelly - scientist?, and
??????/Shintaro Ishihara - ??/governor?
pairs appear frequently in ?title? coreference
links in both English and Chinese corpora;
?Elizabeth II? is very often involved in an ?em-
ployment? relation with ?United Kingdom? in
English corpora. On the other hand, some in-
correct answers with high global statistics can be
filtered out using these constraints. For exam-
ple, although the query ????/Tang Jiaxuan?
appears frequently together with the candidate
per:title answer ???/personnel?, it is linked by
few coreference links; in contrast, it?s coreferen-
tial with the correct title answer ?????/State
Council member? much more frequently.
We processed cross-lingual comparable cor-
pora to extract coreference links, relations and
events among mentions (names, nominals and
time expressions etc.) and stored them in an
external knowledge base. Any pair of <q, a>
is then compared to the entries in this knowl-
edge base. We used 157,708 documents from
Chinese TDT5 and Gigaword to count Chinese
global statistics, and 7,148,446 documents from
DARPA GALE MT training corpora to count
English global statistics, as shown in features
f12 and f13. Fact based global features f14, f15,
f16 and f17, were calculated from 49,359 Chi-
nese and 280,513 English documents (annotated
by the bilingual IE system in Section 3.3.2.

In this section, we examine the overall perfor-
mance of this method. We then discuss the

Table 4: Validation Features for Crosslingual Slot Filling
the following results, the baseline features are
always used in addition to any other features.
6.1 Overall Performance
Because of the data scarcity, ten-fold cross-
validation, across queries, was used to train
and test the system. Quantitative results after
combining answers from multiple pipelines are
shown in Table 5. We used two basic features,
one is the slot type and the other is the entity
type of the query (i.e. person or organization).
This basic feature set is already successful in im-
proving the precision of the pipelines, although
this results in a number of correct answers be-
ing discarded as well. By adding the additional
validation features described previously, both
the f-score and precision of the models are im-
proved. In the case of the cross-lingual pipelines
(3+4+5) the number of correct answers chosen
is almost doubled while increasing the precision
of the output.
6.2 Impact of Global Validation
A comparison of the benefits of global versus lo-
cal features are shown in Table 6, both of which
dramatically improve scores over the baseline
features. The global features are universally

Table 5: Using Basic Features to Filter Answers
more beneficial than the local features, although
the local features generate results with higher
precision at the expense of the number of correct
answers returned. The global features are espe-
cially useful for pipelines 3+4+5, where the per-
formance using just these features reaches those
of using all other features ? this does not hold
true for the monolingual pipelines however.
6.3 Impact of Fact-driven Deep
Knowledge
The varying benefit of fact-driven cross-
document features and statistical cross-
document features are shown in Table 7.

While both feature sets are beneficial, the
monolingual pipelines (1+2) benefit more
from statistical features while the cross-lingual
pipelines (3+4+7) benefit slightly more from
the fact-based features. Despite this bias, the
overall results when the features are used in
all pipelines are very close with the fact-based
features being slightly more useful overall.

Table 7: Fact vs. Statistical Cross-Doc Features
Translation features were only beneficial to
pipelines 3, 4, and 5, and provided a slight in-
crease in precision from 0.39 to 0.42, but pro-
vided no noticeable benefit when used in con-
junction with results from pipelines 1 and 2.
This is because the answers where translation
features would be most useful were already be-
ing selected by pipelines 1 and 2 using the base-
line features.
6.4 Discussion
The use of any re-scoring, even with baseline
features, provides large gains over the union of
the baseline pipelines, removing large number
of incorrect answers. The use of more sophis-
ticated features provided substantial gains over
the baseline features. In particular, global fea-
tures proved very effective. Further feature en-
gineering to address the remaining errors and
the dropped correct answer would likely provide
increasing gains in performance.
In addition, two human annotators, indepen-
dently, conducted the same task on the same
data, with a second pass of adjudication. The F-
scores of inter-annotator agreement were 52.0%
for the first pass and 73.2% for the second pass.
This indicates that slot filling remains a chal-
lenging task for both systems and human anno-
tators?only one monolingual system exceeded
30% F-score in the KBP2010 evaluation.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
Crosslingual slot filling is a challenging task
due to limited performance in two separate ar-
eas: information extraction and machine trans-
lation. Various methods of combining tech-
niques from these two areas provided weak yet
complementary baseline pipelines. We proposed
an effective approach to integrate these base-
lines and enhance their performance using wider
and deeper knowledge from comparable cor-
pora. The final system based on cross-lingual
comparable corpora outperformed monolingual
pipelines on much larger monolingual corpora.
The intuition behind our approach is that
over-generation of candidate answers from weak
baselines provides a potentially strong recall
upper-bound. The remaining enhancement be-
comes simpler: filtering errors. Our experiments
also suggest that our rescoring models tend to
over-fit due to small amount of training data.
Manual annotation and assessment are quite
costly, motivating future work in active learning
and semi-supervised learning methods. In addi-
tion, we plan to apply our results as feedback to
improve MT performance on facts using query
and answer-driven language model adaptation.
We have demonstrated our approach on English-
Chinese pair, but the framework is language-
independent; ultimately we would like to extend
the task to extracting information from more
languages.
