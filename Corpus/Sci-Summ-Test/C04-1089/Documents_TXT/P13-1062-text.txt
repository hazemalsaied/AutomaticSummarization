Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 631?640, Sofia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c ? 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics Bootstrapping Entity Translation on Weakly Comparable Corpora Taesung Lee and Seung-won Hwang Department of Computer Science and Engineering Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) Pohang, Republic of Korea {elca4u, swhwang}@postech.edu Abstract This paper studies the problem of mining named entity translations from compara .ble corpora with some ?asymmetry?. Un.like the previous approaches relying on the ?symmetry? found in parallel corpora, the proposed method is tolerant to asymme.try often found in comparable corpora, by distinguishing different semantics of rela.tions of entity pairs to selectively prop.agate seed entity translations on weakly comparable corpora. Our experimental results on English-Chinese corpora show that our selective propagation approach outperforms the previous approaches in named entity translation in terms of the mean reciprocal rank by up to 0.16 for or.ganization names, and 0.14 in a low com.parability case. 1 Introduction Identifying and understanding entities is a cru.cial step in understanding text. This task is more challenging in the presence of multilingual text, because translating named entities (NEs), such as persons, locations, or organizations, is a non-trivial task. Early research on NE trans .lation used phonetic similarities, for example, to mine the translation ? Mandelson ? ? ? ? ? ? ??[ManDeErSen] with similar sounds. However, not all NE translations are based on translitera.tions, as shown in Table 1? Some translations, especially the names of most organizations, are based on semantic equivalences. Furthermore, names can be abbreviated in one or both lan.guages, e.g., the ? World Trade Organization? (? ?????) can be called the ?WTO? (? ? ? ?). Another challenging example is that, a trans.lation can be arbitrary, e.g., ?Jackie Chan? ? ? ? ?? [ChengLong]. There are many approaches English Chinese World Trade Organization ?????? [ShiJieMaoYiZuZhi] WTO ? ? ? ? [ShiMaoZuZhi] Jackie Chan ? ? [ChengLong] Table 1: Examples of non-phonetic translations. that deal with some of these challenges (Lam et al., 2007; Yang et al, 2009), e.g., by combin.ing phonetic similarity and a dictionary. How.ever, arbitrary translations still cannot be handled by examining the NE pair itself. Corpus-based ap.proaches (Kupiec, 1993; Feng, 2004), by mining external signals from a large corpus, such as par.enthetical translation ? ? ? (Jackie Chan) ? , com.plement the problem of transliteration-based ap.proaches, but the coverage of this approach is lim.ited to popular entities with such evidence. The most effective known approach to NE translation has been a holistic framework (You et al., 2010; Kim et al, 2011; You et al, 2012) com.bining transliteration- and corpus-based methods. In these approaches, both 1) arbitrary translations and 2) lesser-known entities can be handled, by propagating the translation scores of known enti.ties to lesser-known entities if they co-occur fre.quently in both corpora. For example, a lesser.known entity Tom Watson can be translated if Mandelson and Tom Watson co-occur frequently in an English corpus, and their Chinese transla.tions also co -occur frequently in a Chinese corpus, i.e., if the co -occurrences in the two corpora are ?symmetric?. A research question we ask in this paper is: What if comparable corpora are not comparable enough to support this symmetry assumption? We found that this is indeed the case. For exam.ple, even English and Chinese news from the same publisher may have different focus? the Chi .nese version focuses more on Chinese Olympic 631 teams and Chinese local news. In the presence of such asymmetry, all previous approaches, building upon symmetry, quickly deteriorate by propagat.ing false positives. For example, co -occurrence of Mandelson and Tom Watson may not appear in a Chinese corpus, which may lead to the translation of Tom Watson into another Chinese entity Gor.don Brown which happens to co -occur with the Chinese translation of Mandelson. Our key contribution is to avoid such false propagation, by discerning the semantics of rela.tions. For example, relations between Mandelson and Tom Watson, should be semantically differ.ent from Chinese relations between ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Gordon Brown) and ?????? (Mandelson). A naive approach would be finding documents with a similar topic such as politics, and scientific dis.covery, and allowing propagation only when the topic agrees. However, we found that a topic is a unit that is too coarse for this task because most articles on Mandelson will invariably fall into the same topic1. In clear contrast, we selectively prop.agate seed translations, only when the relations in the two corpora share the same semantics. This selective propagation can be especially ef.fective for translating challenging types of enti.ties such as organizations including theWTO used with and without abbreviation in both languages. Applying a holistic approach (You et al, 2012) on organizations leads to poor results, 0.06 in terms of the F1-score. A naive approach to in.crease the precision would be to consider multi.type co-occurrences, hoping that highly precise translations of some type, e.g., persons with an F1-score of 0.69 (You et al, 2012), can be prop.agated to boost the precision on organizations. In our experiments, this naive multi-type prop.agation still leads to an unsatisfactory F1-score of 0.12. Such a low score can be explained by the following example. When translating ?WTO? using the co -occurrence with ?Mandelson?, other co-occurrences such as (London, Mandelson) and (EU, Mandelson) produce a lot of noise because the right translation of WTO does not share much phonetic/semantic similarity. Our understanding of relation semantics, can distinguish ?Mandelson was born in London? from ? Mandelson visited the WTO? , to stop false propagations, which gener.ates an F1-score 0.25 higher than the existing ap .1The MRR for organization names achieved by a topic model-based approach was 0.15 lower than our best. proaches. More formally, we enable selective propagation of seed translations on weakly comparable cor.pora, by 1) clarifying the detailed meaning of rela.tional information of co -occurring entities, and 2) identifying the contexts of the relational informa.tion using statement-level context comparison. In other words, we propagate the translation score of a known translation pair to a neighbor pair if the semantics of their relations in English and Chinese corpora are equivalent to accurately propagate the scores. For example, if we know ? Russia? ? ? ? ? ??(1) and join???(2), then from a pair of state.ments ? Russia(1) joins(2) theWTO(3)? and ? ? ? ? (1) ??(2) ? ? ? ? (3)? , we can propagate the trans.lation score of (Russia, ? ? ? )(1) to (WTO, ? ???)(3). However, we do not exploit a pair of statements ?Russia joined the WTO? and ???? ??(2? ) ???? because ? ? (2? ) does not mean join(2). Furthermore, we mine a similar English-Chinese document pair that can be found by com.paring the entity relationships, such as ?Mandel.son visited Moscow ? and ? Mandelson met Alexei Kudrin? , within the English document and the Chinese document to leverage similar contexts to assure that we use symmetric parts. For this goal, we first extract relations among entities in documents, such as visit and join, and mine semantically equivalent relations across the languages, e.g., English and Chinese, such as join? ? ? . Once these relation translations are mined, similar document pairs can be identified by comparing each constituent relationship among entities using their relations. Knowing document similarity improves NE translation, and improved NE translation can boost the accuracy of document and relationship similarity. This iterative process can continue until convergence. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to translate a broad range of multilin.gual relations and exploit them to enhance NE translation. In particular, our approach leverages semantically similar document pairs to exclude incomparable parts that appear in one language only. Our method outperforms the previous ap.proaches in translating NE up to 0.16 in terms of the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) for organization names. Moreover, our method shows robustness, with 0.14 higher MRR than seed translations, on less comparable corpora. 632 2 Related Work This work is related to two research streams: NE translation and semantically equivalent relation mining. Entity translation Existing approaches on NE translation can be cat.egorized into 1) transliteration-based, 2) corpus.based, and 3) hybrid approaches. Transliteration-based approaches (Wan and Ver.spoor, 1998; Knight and Graehl, 1998) are the foundations of many decent methods, but they alone suffer from ambiguity (e.g., ? ? ? and ??? have the same sounds) and cannot han.dle non-transliterated cases such as ?Jackie Chan (? ? [ChengLong])? . Some methods (Lam et al, 2007; Yang et al, 2009) rely on meanings of con .stituent letters or words to handle organization name translation such as ? Bank of China (?? ??)? , whose translation is derived from ? China (? ? )?, and ?a bank (? ? )?. However, many names often originate from abbreviation (such as ?WTO? ); hence we cannot always leverage mean.ings. Corpus-based approaches (Kupiec, 1993; Lin et al., 2008; Jiang et al, 2009) exploit high-quality bilingual evidence such as parenthetical transla.tion, e.g., ? ? ? (Jackie Chan) ? , (Lin et al, 2008), semi-structural patterns (Jiang et al, 2009), and parallel corpus (Kupiec, 1993). However, the cov.erage of the corpus-based approaches is limited to popular entities with such bilingual evidences. On the other hand, our method can cover entities with monolingual occurrences in corpora, which signif.icantly improves the coverage. The most effective known approach is a holis .tic framework that combines those two ap .proaches (You et al, 2012; You et al, 2010; Kim et al, 2011). You et al (2010; 2012) leverage two graphs of entities in each language, that are gen.erated from a pair of corpora, with edge weights quantified as the strength of the relatedness of en .tities. Then, two graphs are iteratively aligned us.ing the common neighbors of two entities. Kim et al. (2011) build such graphs using the context sim.ilarity, measured with a bag of words approach, of entities in news corpora to translate NEs. How .ever, these approaches assume the symmetry of the two graphs. This assumption holds if two corpora are parallel, but such resources are scarce. But our approach exploits comparable parts from corpora. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0 10 20 30 40 50 N or m al iz ed O cc ur re nc e Weeks WTO ???? Figure 1: Dissimilarity of temporal distributions of ? WTO? in English and Chinese corpora. Other interesting approaches such as (Klemen.tiev and Roth, 2006; Kim et al, 2012) rely on tem.poral distributions of entities. That is, two entities are considered to be similar if the two entities in different languages have similar occurrence distri.butions over time. However, the effectiveness of this feature also depends on the comparability of entity occurrences in time-stamped corpora, which may not hold as shown in Figure 1. In clear con .trast, our method can find and compare articles, on different dates, describing the same NE. More.over, our method does not require time stamps. Semantically similar relation mining Recently, similar relation mining in one language has been studied actively as a key part of automatic knowledge base construction. In automatically constructed knowledge bases, finding semanti.cally similar relations can improve understanding of the Web describing content with many different expressions. As such an effort, PATTY (Nakas.hole et al, 2012) finds similar relations with al.most the same support sets? the sets of NE pairs that co-occur with the relations. However, because of the regional locality of information, bilingual corpora contain many NE pairs that appear in only one of the support sets of the semantically identi.cal relations. NELL (Mohamed et al, 2011) finds related relations using seed pairs of one given re.lation; then, using K-means clustering, it finds re.lations that are semantically similar to the given relation. Unfortunately, this method requires that we set K manually, and extract relations for each given relation. Therefore, this is unsuitable to sup.port general relations. There are only few works on translating rela.tions or obtaining multi-lingual similar relations. Schone et al (2011) try to find relation patterns 633 in multiple languages for given seed pairs of a re.lation. Because this approach finds seed pairs in Wikipedia infoboxes, the number of retrievable re.lations is restricted to five. Kim et al (2010) seek more diverse types of relations, but it requires par.allel corpora, which are scarce. 3 Framework Overview In this section, we provide an overview of our framework for translating NEs, using news cor.pora in English and Chinese as a running example. Because such corpora contain asymmetric parts, the goal of our framework is to overcome asym.metry by distinguishing the semantics of relations, and leveraging document context defined by the relations of entities. (e) Iteration on ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

For this purpose, we build a mutual bootstrap.ping framework (Figure 2), between entity trans.lation and relation translation using extracted re.lationships of entities (Figure 2 (a), Section 4.1). 
More formally, we use the following process: 
1. Base condition (Figure 2 (a), Section 4.2): Ini.tializing T (1)N (eE , eC), a seed entity translation 
score, where eE is an English entity, and eC is 
a Chinese entity. T (1)N can be initialized by pho.netic similarity or other NE translation methods. 
2. Iteration: Obtaining T t+1N using T tN . 
1) Using T tN , we obtain a set of relation 
translations with a semantic similarity score, 
T tR(rE , rC), for an English relation rE and a 
Chinese relation rC (Figure 2 (b), Section 4.3) 
(e.g., rE =visit and rC = ??). 
2) Using T tN and T tR, we identify a set of seman.tically similar document pairs that describe the 
same event with a similarity score T tD(dE , dC) 
where dE is an English document and dC is a 
Chinese document (Figure 2 (c), Section 4.4). 
3) Using T tN , T tR and T tD, we compute T t+1N , an 
improved entity translation score (Figure 2 (d), 
Section 4.5). 
Each sub-goal reinforces the result of others in 
the (t + 1)-th iteration, and by iteratively running 
them, we can improve the quality of translations. 
Note that, hereinafter, we omit (t) for readability 
when there is no ambiguity. 
4 Methods 
In this section, we describe our method in de.tail. First, we explain how we extract statements, 
which are units of relational information, from 
documents in Section 4.1, and how we obtain seed 
name translations in Section 4.2. Next, we present 
our method for discovering relation translations 
across languages in Section 4.3. In Section 4.4, we 
use the name translations and the relation trans.lations to compare document contexts which can 
boost the precision of NE translation. In Sec.tion 4.5, we describe how we use the resources 
obtained so far to improve NE translation. 4.1 Statement Extraction We extract relational statements, which we exploit to propagate translation scores, from an English news corpus and a Chinese news corpus. A rela.tional statement, or simply a statement is a triple (x, r, y), representing a relationship between two names, x and y. For example, from ? Mandel.son recently visited Moscow, ? we obtain this state.ment: (Mandelson, visit, Moscow). We follow a standard procedure to extract statements, as sim .ilarly adopted by Nakashole et al (2012), using Stanford CoreNLP (Klein and Manning, 2003) to lemmatize and parse sentences. Here, we refer readers to existing work for furt her details because this is not our key contribution. 4.2 Seed Entity Translation We need a few seed translation pairs to initi.ate the framework. We build a seed transla.tion score T (1)N (eE , eC) indicating the similar.ity of an English entity eE and a Chinese en .tity eC using an existing method. For exam.ple, most methods would give high value for 634 T (1)N (Mandelson,? ? ? ? [ManDeErSen]). In this work, we adopted (You et al, 2012) with (Lam et al, 2007) as a base translation matrix to build the seed translation function. We also use a dictio.nary to obtain non-NE translations such as ?gov.ernment? . We use an English-Chinese general word dictionary containing approximately 80,000 English-Chinese translation word pairs that was also used by Kim et al (2011) to measure the sim .ilarity of context words of entities. 4.3 Relation Translation We need to identify relations that have the equiv.alent semantics across languages, (e.g., visit? ? ?), to enable selective propagation of translation scores. Formally, our goal is to measure a pair.wise relation translation score TR(rE , rC) for an English relation rE ? RE and a Chinese relation rC ? RC whereRE is a set of all English relations and RC is a set of all Chinese relations. We first explain a basic feature to measure the similarity of two relations, its limitations, and how we address the problems. A basic clue is that re.lations of the same meaning are likely to be men.tioned with the same entity pairs. For example, if we have (Mandelson, visit, Moscow) as well as (Mandelson, head to, Moscow) in the corpus, this is a positive signal that the two relations may share the same meaning. Such NE pairs are called sup.port pairs of the two relations. We formally define this clue for relations in the same language, and then describe that in the bilin.gual setting. A support intersection Hm(ri, rj), a set of support pairs, for monolingual relations ri and rj is defined as Hm(ri, rj) = H(ri) ? H(rj) (1) where H(r) is the support set of a relation r de .fined as H(r) = {(x, y)|(x, r, y) ? S}, and S is either SE , a set of all English statements, or SC , a set of all Chinese statements that we extracted in Section 4.1. Likewise, we can define a support intersection for relations in the different languages using the translation score TN (eE , eC). For an English rela.tion rE and a Chinese relation rC , Hb(rE , rC) ={(xE , xC , yE , yC)| TN (xE , xC) ? ? and TN (yE , yC) ? ? for (xE , rE , yE) ? SE and (xC , rC , yC) ? SC} (2) where ? = 0.6 is a harsh threshold to exclude most of the false translations by TN . Finally, we define a support intersection, a set of support pairs between two relations ri and rj of any languages, H(ri, rj) = ? ?? ?? Hb(ri, rj) if ri ? RE and rj ? RC Hb(rj , ri) if rj ? RE and ri ? RC Hm(ri, rj) otherwise (3) Intuitively, |H(ri, rj)| indicates the strength of the semantic similarity of two relations ri and rj of any languages. However, as shown in Ta.ble 2, we cannot use this value directly to mea.sure the similarity because the support intersection of semantically similar bilingual relations (e.g., |H(head to,??)| = 2) is generally very low, and normalization cannot remedy this problem as we can see from |H(visit,??)| = 27 and |H(visit)| = 1617. Set Cardinality H(visit) 1617 H(? ? ) 2788 H(visit,? ? ) 27 H(head to,? ? ) 2 Table 2: Evidence cardinality in the corpora. ?? visit head to call on denounce criticize blame ask request appeal to fly to 8 2 1 1 2 4 Figure 3: Network of relations. Edges indicate that the relations have a non-empty support inter.section, and edge labels show the size of the inter.section. We found that the connectivity among similar relations is more important than the strength of the similarity. For example, as shown in Figure 3, visit is connected to most of the visit-relations such as head to, ??. Although visit is con.nected to criticize, visit is not connected to other criticize-relations such as denounce and blame, whereas criticize, denounce, and blame are inter.635 ?? visit head to visit-cluster denounce criticize blame      criticize-cluster call on 10 6 fly to 2 call on ask request appeal to request-cluster Figure 4: Relation clusters and a few individual relations. Edge labels show the size of the inter.section. connected. To exploit this feature, we use a ran.dom walk -based graph clustering method. Formally, we use Markov clustering (Van Don.gen, 2000) on a graph G = (V,E) of relations, where V = RE ? RC is a set of all English and Chinese relations. An edge (ri, rj) indicates that two relations in any languages are similar, and its weight is quantified by a sigmoid function on a linear transformation of |H(ri, rj)| that was em.pirically found to produce good results. Each resultant cluster forms a set of bilingual similar relations, c = {rc1 , ..., rcM }, such as visit.cluster, which consists of visit, head to, and?? in Figure 4. However, this cluster may not contain all similar relations. A relation may have multi.ple meanings (e.g., call on) so it can be clustered to another cluster, or a relation might not be clus.tered when its support set is too small (e.g., fly to). For such relations, rather than assigning zero similarity to visit-relations, we compute a cluster membership function based on support pairs of the cluster members and the target relation, and then formulate a pairwise relation translation score. Formally, we learn the membership function of a relation r to a cluster c using support vec.tor regression (Joachims, 1999) with the follow.ing features based on the support set of cluster c, H(c) = ?r? c H(r), and the support intersection of r and c, H(r, c) = ? r??c H(r, r?). ? f1(r, c) = |H(r, c)|/|H(r)|: This quantifies the degree of inclusion, H(c) ? H(r). ? f2(r, c) = |H(r, c)|/|H(c)|: This quantifies the degree of inclusion, H(r) ? H(c). ? f3(r, c) = |Hwithin(r, c)|/|Hwithin(c)|: This is a variation of f2 that considers only noun phrase pairs shared at least once by relations in c. ? f4(r, c) = |Hwithin(r, c)|/|Hshared(c)|: This is a variation of f2 that considers only noun phrase pairs shared at least once by any pair of relations. ? f5(r, c) = |{r? ? c|H(r, r? ) > 0}|/|c|: This is the degree of connectivity to the cluster mem.bers. where Hwithin(r, c) = ? r? ? c H(r, c) ? H(r, r? ), the intersection, considering translation, of H(r) and noun phrase pairs shared at once by rela.tions in c, Hwithin(c) = ? r??c H(r? , c ? {r ?}), and Hshared(c) = ? r??RE? RC H(r? , c), the nounphrase pairs shared at once by any relations. The use of Hwithin and Hshared is based on the obser.vation that a noun phrase pair that appear in only one relation tends to be an incorrectly chunked en.tity such as ? World Trade? from the ? World Trade Organization?. Based on this membership function S(r, c), we compute pairwise relation similarity. We consider that two relations are similar if they have at least one cluster that the both relations belong to, which can be measured with S(r, c). More formally, pairwise similarity of relations ri and rj is defined as TR(ri, rj) = maxc? C S(r i, c) ? S(rj , c) (4) where C is a set of all clusters. 4.4 Statement-level Document Context Comparison A brute-force statement matching approach often fails due to ambiguity created by ignoring con.text, and missing information in TN or TR. There.fore, we detect similar document pairs to boost the statement matching process. Unlike the pre.vious approaches (e.g., bag-of-words), we focus 
on the relationships of entities within documents 
using the extracted statements. 
Formally, we compute the similarity of two 
statements sE = (xE , rE , yE) and sC = 
(xC , rC , yC) in different languages as follows: 
TS(sE , sC) = TN (xE , xC)TR(rE , rC)TN (yE , yC) 
(5) With this definition, we can find similar statements described with different vocabularies in different languages. To compare a document pair, we use the fol.lowing equation to measure the similarity of an 636 English document diE and a Chinese document djC based on their statements SiE and SjC , respectively: TD(diE , djC) = ? (sE ,sC)? B TS(s i,r E , s j,r C ) |SiE |+ |SiE | ? |B| (6) whereB ? SiE ? SjC is a greedy approximate solu.tion of maximum bipartite matching (West, 1999) on a bipartite graph GB = (VB = (SiE , SjC), EB) with edge weights that are defined by TS . The maximum bipartite matching finds a subset of edges in SiE ? SjC that maximize the sum of the selected edge weights and that do not share a node as their anchor point. 4.5 Iteration on TN In this section, we describe how we use the state.ment similarity function TS , and the document similarity function TD to improve and derive the next generation entity translation function T (t+1)N . We consider that a pair of an English entity eE and a Chinese entity eC are likely to indicate the same real world entity if they have 1) semantically sim .ilar relations to the same entity 2) under the same context. Formally, we define an increment func.tion as follows. ?TN (eE , eC)= ? diE ? djC TD(di, dj) max (sE ,sC)? B? TS(sE , sC) (7) whereB? is a subset ofB ? SiE ? SjC such that the connected statements mention eE and eC , andB is the greedy approximate solution of maximum bi.partite matching for the set SiE of statements of diE and the set SjC of statements of djC . In other words, B? is a set of matching statement pairs mention.ing the translation target eE and eC in the docu .ment pair. Then, we use the following equation to improve the original entity translation function. T (t+1)N (eE , eC) = (1? ? ) ?TN (eE , eC) ? e?C ?TN (eE , e ? C) + ? TN (eE , eC) (8) where ? is a mixing parameter in [0, 1]. We set ? = 0.6 in our experiments. With this update, we obtain the improved NE translations considering the relations that an en .tity has to other entities under the same context to achieve higher precision. 5 Experiments In this section, we present experimental settings and results of translating entity names using our methods compared with several baselines. 5.1 Data and Evaluation We processed news articles for an entire year in 2008 by Xinhua news who publishes news in both English and Chinese, which were also used by Kim et al (2011) and Shao and Ng (2004). The English corpus consists of 100,746 news articles, and the Chinese corpus consists of 88,031 news articles. The news corpora are not parallel but comparable corpora, with asymmetry of entities and relationship as the asymmetry in the number of documents also suggest. Examples of such lo.cality in Xinhua news include the more extensive coverage of Chinese teams in the Olympics and domestic sports in the Chinese news. Our frame.work finds and leverages comparable parts from the corpora without document -content-external in.formation such as time stamps. We also show that, under the decreasing comparability, our method retains higher MRR than the baselines. We follow the evaluation procedures used by You et al (2012) and Kim et al (2011) to fairly and precisely compare the effectiveness of our methods with baselines. To measure perfor.mance, we use mean reciprocal rank (MRR) to evaluate a translation function T : MRR(T ) = 1|Q| ? (u,v)? Q rankT (u, v) (9) where Q is the set of gold English-Chinese trans .lation pairs (u, v) and rankT (u, v) is the rank of T (u, v) in {T (u,w)|w is a Chinese entity}. In ad.dition, we use precision, recall, and F1-score. As gold translation pairs, we use the evaluation data used by You et al (2012) with additional la.bels, especially for organizations. The labeling task is done by randomly selecting English enti.ties and finding their Chinese translation from the Chinese corpus. We only use entities with trans.lations that appear in the Chinese corpus. We present the evaluation results for persons and or.ganizations to show the robustness of the meth.ods. In total, we identified 490 English entities in the English news with Chinese translations in the Chinese news. Among the 490 entities, 221 NEs are persons and 52 NEs are organizations. 637 Person Organization MRR P. R. F1 MRR P. R.

TSPH+P (You et al, 2012) is a holistic method that uses a transliteration method as base translations, and then reinforces them to achieve higher quality. This method uses only a single type of entities to propagate the translation scores. ? TMPH+P is the holistic method revised to use naive multi-type propagation that uses multi.ple types of entities to reinforce the transla.tion scores. ? THB is a linear combination of transliteration and semantic translation methods (Lam et al, 2007) tuned to achieve the highest MRR. ? TDict is a dictionary-only method. This dic.tionary is used by both THB and TN . Only the translation pairs of scores above 0.35 are used for TPH+P to maximize the F1-score to measure precision, recall and F1-score. For our method T (t)N , we use the result with (t) = 1, the seed translations, and (t) = 2, which means that only one pass of the whole framework is per.formed to improve the seed translation function. In addition, we use translation pairs with scores above 0.05 to measure precision, recall, and F1.score. Note that these thresholds do not affect MRRs. 5.3 NE Translation Results

in Table 3, where the highest values are boldfaced, 
except TDict which shows 1.00 precision because 
it is a manually created dictionary. For both the 
person and organization cases, our method T (2)N 
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms

Figure 6: MRR with decreasing comparability. 
of precision, recall, F1-score and MRR. With only 
one iteration of selective propagation, the seed 
translation is improved to achieve the 0.09 higher 
MRR. 
The baselines show lower, but comparable 
MRRs and F1-scores for persons that mostly con.sist of transliterated cases. However, not all trans .lations have phonetic similarity, especially orga.nization names, as the low F1-score of TSPH+P , 0.06, for organizations suggests. The naive multi.type propagation TMPH+P shows decreased MRR for both persons and organizations compared to the single-type propagation TSPH+P , which shows a negative influence of diverse relation semantics of entities of different types. THB achieves a bet.ter MRR than TPH+P due to the semantic transla.tion of organization names. However, despite the increased recall of THB over that of TDict, the pre.cision of THB is unsatisfactory because THB maps abbreviated names such as ?WTO? with other NEs. On the other hand, our method achieves the high.est MRR and precision in both the person and or.ganization categories. As shown in Table 4, THB translates ? WTO? in.accurately, linking it to an incorrect organization ?????? (Palestine Liberation Organization). 638 The European Union (EU) Trade Commissioner (1) Peter Mandelson traveled to Moscow on Thursday for talks on ? Mandelson said it is a priority to see (2) Russia join the WTO, ? ?????? (1) ??????14????????, ??????????????, (2) ?????????????????????, ? (Peter Mandelson, traveled to, Moscow) (??????, ????, ???) (Russia, join, WTO) (???, ??, ????) 1) 2) Figure 5: Example of similar document pairs. Moreover, the use of the corpora by T (1)N could not fix this problem, and it finds another organi.zation related to trade, ? ? ? ? ? ? (Shanghai Co.operation Organization). In contrast, our selective propagation method T (2)N , which uses the wrong seed translation by T (1)N , ? ? ? ? ? ? (Shang.hai Cooperation Organization), successfully trans.lates the WTO using statements such as (Russia, join, WTO), and its corresponding Chinese state.ment (? ? ? , ? ? , ? ? ? ? ). Similarly, both the baseline THB and the seed translation T (1)N matched Microsoft to incorrect Chinese entities that are phonetically similar as indicated by the underlined text. In contrast, T (2)N finds the correct translation despite the phonetic dissimilarity. 5.4 NE Translation Results with Low Corpus Comparability We tested the methods using less comparable data to evaluate the robustness with the following de .rived datasets: ? D0:All news articles are used. ? D1: January-December English and July-December Chinese articles are used. ? D2:April-September English and July-December Chinese articles are used. Figure 6 shows the MRR comparisons of our method T (2)N and T (1)N on all test entities. Be.cause the commonly appearing NEs are decreas.ing, the performance decline is inevitable. How.ever, we can see that the MRR of the seed trans .lation method drops significantly on D1 and D2, whereas our method shows 0.14 higher MRR for both cases. 5.5 Similar Documents In this section, we show an example of similar documents in Figure 5. Both articles describe the same event about the visit of Mandelson to Moscow for the discussion on the joining of Rus.sia to the WTO. The extracted statements are the exact translations of each corresponding part as in.dicated by the arrows. We stress this is an extreme case for illustration, where the two sentences are almost an exact translation, except for a minor asymmetry involving the date (Thursday in En.glish, and 14th in Chinese). In most similar doc .uments, the asymmetry is more significant. The seed translation score T 1N (WTO,? ? ? ? ) is not enough to match the entities. However, the context similarity, due to other similar statements such as (1), allows us to match (2). This match helps trans .lation of ? WTO? by inspecting the organization that Russia considers to join in both documents. 6 Conclusions This paper proposed a bootstrapping approach for entity translation using multilingual relational clustering. Further, the proposed method could finds similar document pairs by comparing state.ments to enable us to focus on comparable parts of evidence. We validated the quality of our approach using real-life English and Chinese corpora, and its performance significantly exceeds that of pre.vious approaches.
