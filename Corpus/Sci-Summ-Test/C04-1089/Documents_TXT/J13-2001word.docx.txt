In this article, an integrated model is derived that jointly identiﬁes and aligns bilingual named 
entities (NEs) between Chinese and English.  The model is motivated by the following obser- 
vations: (1) whether an NE is translated semantically or phonetically  depends greatly on its 
entity type, (2) entities within an aligned pair should share the same type, and (3) the initially 
detected NEs can act as anchors and provide further information while selecting NE candidates. 
Based on these observations,  this article proposes a translation  mode ratio feature (deﬁned as 
the proportion of NE internal tokens that are semantically  translated),  enforces an entity type 
consistency constraint, and utilizes additional new NE likelihoods  (based on the initially detected 
NE anchors).
    Experiments show that this novel method signiﬁcantly  outperforms  the baseline. The type- 
insensitive F-score of identiﬁed NE pairs increases from 78.4% to 88.0% (12.2% relative im- 
provement) in our Chinese–English NE alignment task, and the type-sensitive F-score increases 
from 68.4% to 83.0% (21.3% relative improvement). Furthermore, the proposed model demon- 
strates its robustness when it is tested across different domains. Finally, when semi-supervised 
learning is conducted to train the adopted English  NE recognition model, the proposed model 
also signiﬁcantly boosts the English  NE recognition type-sensitive F-score.

1. Introduction

Named entities   (NEs),  especially person  names   (PER),  location   names   (LOC),  and 
organization names  (ORG), deliver essential context and meaning in human languages. 
Therefore, NE translation plays a critical role in trans-lingual language processing tasks, 
such  as machine translation (MT) and  cross-lingual information retrieval. To learn  NE 
translation knowledge, bilingual NE  alignment (which  links  source  NEs  and  target 
NEs  to generate desired NE  pairs)  is the  ﬁrst  step  in  producing the  NE  translation 
table  (which  can then  be used  to train  the  NE translation model).  Furthermore, with 
additional alignment constraints from  the  other  language, the alignment module can 
also reﬁne  those  initially  recognized NEs, and  thus  can be adopted to conduct semi- 
supervised learning to learn monolingual NE recognition models from a large untagged 
bilingual corpus.
    Because  NE alignment can only  be conducted after  its associated NEs have  been 
identiﬁed, the NE recognition errors  propagate into the alignment stage. The type- 
insensitive inclusion rate1   of the  initial  recognition stage  thus  signiﬁcantly limits  the 
ﬁnal alignment performance. One way to alleviate this error  propagation problem is to 
jointly  perform NE recognition and  alignment. Such a combined approach is usually 
infeasible,  however, due  to the high computational cost of evaluating alignment scores 
for a large number2 of NE pair candidates.
    In order  to make  the problem computationally tractable, a sequential approach is 
usually used  to ﬁrst  identify NEs and  then  align  them.  Two such  kinds  of sequential 
strategies that  alleviate the  error  propagation problem have  been  proposed. The ﬁrst 
strategy, named asymmetry  alignment (Al-Onaizan and  Knight  2002; Moore  2003; 
Feng, Lv, and Zhou  2004; Lee, Chang,  and Jang 2006), identiﬁes NEs only on the source 
side and then ﬁnds their corresponding NEs on the target  side. Although this approach 
avoids the NE recognition errors  resulting from the target  side, which  would otherwise 
be brought into the alignment process,  the NE recognition errors  from  the source  side 
continue to affect alignment.
    To further reduce the  errors  from  the  source  side,  the  second  strategy, denoted 
symmetry  alignment (Huang, Vogel,  and  Waibel  2003), expands the  NE  candidate 
sets in both  languages before  conducting the alignment. This is achieved by using  the 
original results as anchors, and enlarging or shrinking the boundaries of the anchors to 
generate new candidates. This strategy fails to work  if the NE anchor has already been 
missed in the  initial  NE recognition stage,  however. In our  data  set  (1,000 Chinese– 
English  sentence pairs  randomly selected   from  the  Chinese   News  Translation Text 
corpus [LDC2005T06]), this strategy signiﬁcantly improves the type-insensitive NE pair 
inclusion rate from 83.9% to 96.1%;3 in the meantime, the type-insensitive Chinese  NE 
(CNE)  recognition inclusion rate  rises  from  88.7% to 95.9%, and  that  of English  NE 
(ENE) from 92.8% to 97.2%. This strategy is thus  adopted in this article.
   Although the symmetric expansion strategy has substantially alleviated the prob- 
lem of error propagation, the ﬁnal alignment accuracy,  in terms of type-sensitive F-score


1 This is the percentage of desired NE pairs  that are included within the given candidate set, and is the 
upper bound for NE alignment performance (type-insensitive means  disregarding NE types).
2 This number will dramatically increase  if the combined approach is adopted, as every possible  string 
will become a NE candidate.
3 This ﬁgure  is based  on the expanded candidates that are constructed without any range  limitation. In 
this case, Inclusion rate = 1 – [Missing Rate of Initial NEs]. In addition, because  not every Chinese  NE is 
linked  in the given sentence pair, the Inclusion rate of Chinese  NEs is even lower  than  that of NE pairs 
(95.9% vs. 96.1%).





(achieved by the  approach proposed by Huang, Vogel,  and  Waibel  [2003]) continues 
to be as low as 68.4% (see in Table 3 in Section  4.3). After  having examined the data, 
we found the following: (1) How  a given  NE is translated, either  semantically (called 
translation)  or phonetically (called  transliteration),  depends greatly on its associated 
entity  type.4 The translation mode ratio, which  is the percentage of NE internal tokens 
that are translated semantically, thus can help to identify the NE type. (2) Entities within 
an aligned pair  should share  the same  type,  and  this  restriction should be integrated 
into the NE alignment model  as a constraint. (3) In prior  work,  the initially  identiﬁed 
monolingual NEs were  used  only  to construct the  candidate set without playing any 
role in ﬁnal NE identiﬁcation. Indeed, these monolingual NEs do carry other  useful  in- 
formation and can act as anchors to give NE likelihoods, which  can provide additional 
scope preference information to those regenerated candidates.
    Based on these observations, we propose a novel joint model that adopts the transla- 
tion mode ratio, enforces  the entity type consistency constraint, and also utilizes  the NE 
likelihoods. This proposed approach jointly  identiﬁes and  aligns  bilingual NEs under 
an integrated framework, which  consists  of three  stages:  Initial  NE Recognition, NE- 
Candidate Set Expansion, and NE Re-identiﬁcation & Alignment. The Initial NE Recog- 
nition  stage  identiﬁes the initial  NEs and  their  associated NE types  in both  the source 
and  target.  In the  next  stage,  NE Candidate Set Expansion regenerates the  candidate 
sets in both languages in order  to remedy the initial  NE recognition errors.  In the ﬁnal 
stage, NE Re-identiﬁcation & Alignment jointly recognizes and aligns bilingual NEs via 
the  proposed joint model.  The experimental results validate our  proposed three-step 
method.
    The  integrated model  that  jointly  identiﬁes and  aligns  bilingual named entities 
between Chinese  and  English  was originally introduced in Chen, Zong, and  Su (2010). 
In this  article,  the  problem has  been  re-formulated and  derived. The new  derivation 
starts  from  two given NE sequences,  whereas the  original derivation only  begins  with 
one given NE pair. We also give more  details  of the problem study, model  analysis, and 
experiments. Moreover, we  report additional experiments, which  include those  that 
study the effect of adopting different initial NE recognizers and the effectiveness of the 
proposed model  across different domains. Finally, a complete error  analysis is given in 
the current version.
    The remainder of this article  is organized as follows:  Section 2 motivates the pro- 
posed method. Afterwards, the  proposed model  is formally introduced in Section  3. 
Section  4 describes experiments conducted on various conﬁgurations of the  method. 
The  associated error  analysis and  discussion of  results are  presented in  Section  5. 
Section 6 gives applications of the proposed model. We review  related work in Section 7. 
Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 8.

2. Motivation

By examining the  NEs  initially   recognized in  aligned sentence pairs,  we  have  the 
following two  observations: (1) Alignment can help  ﬁx those  NEs that  are initially  in- 
correctly  recognized when they are not the correct counterparts of each other. Therefore,



4 The proportions of semantic translation (which  denote the ratios of semantically translated words 
among all the associated words within NEs) for PER, LOC, and ORG are approximately 0%, 28.6%, and
74.8%, respectively, in the Chinese–English name  entity  list (2005T34) released by the Linguistic Data 
Consortium (LDC). Because titles, such as “sir” and “chairman,” are not considered part  of person 
names  in this corpus, all PERs are transliterated.





alignment and  recognition should be jointly optimized. (2) Alignment cannot  help  in 
determining the appropriate scope when  each word within an NE (or within its larger 
context window covering the NE) is correctly  matched to its counterpart. Therefore, the 
information of those initial NEs should be utilized to decide  the appropriate NE scope. 
The following two sections  further elaborate on these two observations.


2.1 Alignment Helps NE Recognition

In NE recognition, both  boundary identiﬁcation and  type  classiﬁcation are  required. 
The complexity of these  tasks  varies  with  different languages, however. For example, 
Chinese  NE boundaries are not obvious because  adjacent  words are not separated by 
spaces. In contrast, English NE boundaries are easier to identify with explicit words and 
capitalization clues. On the other  hand, classiﬁcation of English  NE type  is considered 
more challenging (Ji and Grishman 2006).
    Because  alignment would force the  NEs in the  linked  NE pair  to share  the  same 
semantic meaning, the  NE  that  is  more  reliably  identiﬁed in  one  language can  be 
used  to identify its less reliable  counterpart in the other  language. This beneﬁt,  which 
is observed in both  NE boundary identiﬁcation and  type  classiﬁcation, indicates that 
alignment can be used  to locate those  NEs that  are initially  incorrectly recognized. For 
example, once  the correct  boundaries are drawn in one language, word equivalences 
inside  an aligned NE pair  can help  identify NE boundaries in the language that  does 
not have explicit clues (e.g., Chinese). As shown in Example (1), even though the desired
Chinese  NE “北韩中央通信社” is only partially recognized as “北韩中央” in the initial
recognition stage,  it can  be  recovered if the  English  counterpart North Korean  [no’s]
Central News Agency is given.  The reason  for this is that  News Agency is better  aligned 
to “通信社”, rather than  be deleted, which  would occur if “北韩中央” is chosen  as the
corresponding Chinese  NE.















   On the other  hand, type  consistency constraints can help  correct  the NE type  that 
is less reliably  identiﬁed. Moreover, in identifying the  NE type,  it helps  if we  know 
whether a word is translated or transliterated. As illustrated in Example  (2), the word
lake in the  English  NE  is linked  to the  Chinese  character “湖”, and  this  mapping  is
found to be a translation, not  a transliteration. Because  translation rarely  occurs  for
personal names  (Chen,  Yang,  and  Lin 2003), the  desired NE  type  “LOC”  should be 
shared between the English  NE Lake Constance and its corresponding Chinese  NE “康斯 
坦茨湖.” As a result, the original incorrect type “PER” of the given English NE is ﬁxed; it
thus corroborates the need for using the translation mode ratio and NE type consistency 
constraint.





2.2 Initial NEs Carry NE Scope Information

In Huang, Vogel,  and  Waibel  (2003), initial  NE  information was  discarded once  the 
new  candidate set was  generated. Alignment scores  alone,  however, are incapable of 
selecting  the appropriate NE scope in some cases. For instance, when  each word in an 
NE is correctly  matched to its counterpart, the  alignment score  might  still prefer  an 
incorrect NE pair  with  smaller  scope,  even  after the normalization of alignment terms 
has  been  considered (explained in Section  4.3). On the  other  hand, when  words sur- 
rounding the desired NE are also correctly  matched to their  counterpart, the incorrect 
NE pair with larger scope might be chosen. As illustrated in Example (3), the desired NE
pair  {(德国)::[Germany]} is initially  correctly  recognized, although the wrong NE pair
{(德国经济)::[Germany economy]} is ﬁnally selected from the regenerated candidate set
















if only alignment scores are used  in the ﬁnal selection  process.  This is because  the extra 
words “经济” and  economy are a perfect  translation of each other,  thus  resulting in the 
incorrect pair  {(德 国 经 济)::[Germany  economy]}, which  receives  a higher alignment 
score than does the correct NE pair {(德国)::[Germany]}.



















    It must  also be noted  that an NE alignment model  usually ignores  a fair amount of 
potentially useful  information that  is commonly used  in monolingual NE recognition 
models. For example, the bigrams of text surrounding NEs are frequently adopted in 
a monolingual NE recognition model,  but  not  in a bilingual alignment model.  Other





examples include case information, part-of-speech (POS) triggers, gazetteer features, 
and  external macro  context  features mentioned in Zhou  and  Su (2006). The alignment 
model  fails to consider the monolingual context  surrounding NEs while  determining 
NE scope,  resulting in the error  mentioned in Example  3. By ignoring the initial  NEs 
after their  corresponding candidate sets have  been generated, we lose the information 
provided by  these  initial  NEs  that  is  otherwise available to  the  alignment model. 
Therefore, though the  initially  detected NEs might  be unreliable by themselves, they 
should act as anchors to provide scope preference information, even after the expanded 
candidate set has been generated from these NEs.


3. The Proposed Joint Model


Given  a  Chinese–English sentence  pair   (Sc, Se),  with   its  initial  (denoted by  lower 
case  letter   b,  for  ”beginning”)  Chinese   NEs  [Cbi , Tci ]Nc  , Nc ≥ 1  and   English   NEs 
[Ebj , Tej ]Ne , Ne ≥ 1 , where Nc and  Ne are the numbers of initially  recognized NEs of
Chinese  and English,  respectively; Tci  and Tej  are the original NE types  assigned to Cbi 
and  Ebj  , respectively. (For the reader ’s convenience, all adopted notations are listed  in 
Table 1 for quick  reference.) We ﬁrst  regenerate two  NE candidate sets (by enlarging 
and  shrinking the  boundaries of those  initial  NEs)  to  include, we  hope,  the  correct 
corresponding candidates that failed to be recognized in the ﬁrst stage. Let CKc and EKe
1	1
denote the two sets that  include those  regenerated candidates for Chinese  and  English
NEs, respectively (Kc and Ke are their set-sizes), and K = min (Nc, Ne). Then, the total K 
pairs of the ﬁnal Chinese  and English NEs will be extracted from the Cartesian product 
of CKc and  EKe . Here,  only NE pairs  in one-to-one mappings will be extracted, as most
1 	1
applications are only interested in this kind of correspondence. Therefore, we will let CK
and  EK denote the two extracted candidate sets to be linked,  and  these sets will consist


of non-overlapping NE  candidates from  CKc


and  EKe , respectively (for  conciseness,


we  will  not   explicitly   distinguish  between  the   indices   CK


and   CKc ,  or  between


EK	Ke
1  and E1  ).
Let {Ca(k) , Ek } denote a speciﬁc NE-linking-pair (where a(k) and k are the associated
indices  of those regenerated Chinese  and  English  NEs within CK and  EK , respectively);
1	1
the  subscript a(k) denotes that  Ca(k)  is aligned to Ek . Let Tk  be the  NE type  to be re-
assigned and shared by Ca(k) and Ek (as they should denote the same entity).  Assuming
that  only  one-to-one mappings of NE pairs  will  be extracted, the  problem of getting

For any given  NE–pair sequence {C	, E   K


, the internal max operator will ﬁrst


operate over each re-assigned type-sequences TK (where T belongs  to PER, LOC, ORG 
for each given  NE pair included in the NE–pair sequence). The outer  argmax operator 
will cross every admissible NE–pair sequence.
    This  formulation  implies   that   recognition  and   alignment  are  executed  jointly 
with  respect  to  CK  and  EK , without making any  independence assumptions among
1 	1
those   NE  pairs   included  in  the   associated  NE–pair  sequence.  This   equation  is
thus   computationally  infeasible due   to  a  large   search   space.   Therefore,  it  is  fur- 
ther  simpliﬁed and  derived as  follows  by  ﬁrst  explicitly  denoting the  link  between


Ca(k)   and  Ek as AS,k = {Ca(k) , Ek }. Let {AS,k }K


(abbreviated as AK  ) denote one  possi-


ble  alignment between CK


and  EK . We  will  then  have  
K!  different possible   align-


ments  between them  (i.e., total factorial  of K different AK  ). Finally, let [Cba(k) , Tca(k) ]K

× P(Ca(k) |Cba(k) , Tca(k) , Tk , Sc) × P(Ek |Ebk , Tek , Tk , Se)



(3)



In  Equation  (3),  P(AS,k |Ca(k) , Ek , Tk )  and   P (Tk |Tca(k) , Tek , Sc, Se)  are   deﬁned  as
NE  Alignment Probability and  NE  Type  Re-assignment Probability, respectively, for


ﬁnding the  ﬁnal  alignment AK


among CK


and  EK


that  have  been  selected.   Both


P(Ca(k) |Cba(k) , Tca(k) , Tk , Sc) and  P(Ek |Ebk , Tek , Tk , Se) are  called  NE likelihoods, and  are
used  to assign  preference to each selected  CK and  EK , based  on the initial  NEs (which
1 	1
act  as  anchors). For  brevity, we  drop the  associated subscripts hereafter, if there  is





no  confusion. These  probabilities will  be  further described in  Sections  3.1 and  3.2. 
Finally,  the  joint identiﬁcation and  alignment framework that  incorporates the  initial 
NE recognition process,  candidate set construction, and  the associated search  process 
are given in Section 3.3.



3.1 Bilingual Related Probabilities

The  NE alignment probability represents the  likelihood of a speciﬁc  alignment AS,k , 
given   C and   E and   their   associated  T.  Because   Chinese   word  segmentation in- 
troduces errors,   especially  for  transliterated words,  the  NE  alignment probability
P(AS,k |Ca(k) , Ek , Tk ) in Equation (3) is derived from E (i.e., starting from the English part).
In addition, because  internal component alignment (denoted as A, to be deﬁned later)
within a given  NE pair  carries  important information (as illustrated in Section 2), the 
internal component alignment will be introduced as follows.

P(AS,k |Ca(k) , Ek , Tk ) = )A P(A|C, E, T)
≈ maxP(A|C, E, T)	(4)

= max[ 1 × P(A|E, T)]
A 	R

where R = l.:A P(A|E, T) is a normalization value,5 which will be ignored for simplicity, 
leaving  only the probability P(A|E, T) to be derived.


Let A be conﬁgured as A ≡ ([cpa(n) , ewn , Mn ]N


, δ), where [cpa(n) , ewn , Mn ] denotes


a linked  pair  of a Chinese  component cpa(n)  (which  might  contain  several  Chinese  char-
acters)  and  an  English  word ewn within C and  E, respectively, with  their  translation
mode  Mn  to be either  translation (abbreviated as TS) or transliteration (abbreviated as
TL). We assume that  there  are  N component transformations in total,  including NTS


translation transformations [cpa(n) , ewn , TS]NTS


and  NTL  transliteration transformations


[cpa(n) , ewn , TL]NTL , such that N = NTS + NTL . Moreover, because  the statistical distribu- 
tion of internal translation mode varies greatly across various NE types (as illustrated in
footnote [4] of this article), the associated translation mode ratio δ = (NTS /N) is an impor- 
tant  feature and  is included in the internal component alignment speciﬁed previously.
For example, if the A between “康斯坦茨湖” and Constance Lake is [康斯坦茨, Constance,
TL] and [湖, Lake, TS] (NTS = NTL  = 1), then its associated translation mode ratio will be
0.5 (i.e., δ = 1/2).
Therefore, the internal alignment probability P(A|E, T) will be further deduced by
introducing the translation mode  Mn  and the translation mode  ratio δ as follows:



P(A|E, T) ≡ P([cpa(n) , ewn , Mn ]N


, δ|E, T)



N
≈ n [P(cpa(n) |Mn , ewn , T) × P(Mn |ewn , T)] × P(δ|T)	(5)
n=1



5 The summation will be taken  over various A that can generate C.





Combining Equations (4) and  (5), the NE alignment probability P(AS,k |Ca(k) , Ek , Tk ),
which  integrates internal component alignment information such  as translation mode
ratio and NE type constraint, is ﬁnally  obtained as follows.



P(AS,k |Ca(k) , Ek , Tk )

where R is the  normalization factor  deﬁned by Equation (4), and  will  be ignored in 
the ﬁnal selection.  In Equation (6), the mappings between internal elements is trained 
from  the  syllable/word alignment of NE pairs  of different NE types.  For translitera- 
tion,  the  model  adopted in Huang, Vogel,  and  Waibel  (2003), which  ﬁrst  romanizes 
Chinese   characters and  then  transliterates them  into  English  characters, is  used  in
estimating P(cpa(n) |TL, ewn , T). For translation, conditional probability is directly used 
for P(cpa(n) |TS, ewn , T).
On the other  hand, the NE type re-assignment probability P (T|Tc, Te, Sc, Se), proposed
in Equation (3), is derived as follows.
                            P (T|Tc, Te, Sc, Se) ≈ P (T|Tc, Te)	(7) 
As Equation (7) shows,  both the initially  assigned Chinese  NE type Tc and  the initially
assigned English NE type Te are adopted to jointly identify their shared NE type T.

3.2 Monolingual NE Likelihoods

The monolingual related probabilities in Equation (3) represent the  likelihood that  a 
regenerated NE candidate is the true NE, given its originally detected NE. For Chinese, 
we derive  the likelihood as follows.



P(C|Cb, Tc, T, Sc)
≡ P (dL , dR , String[C]|Lb, Tc, T)
≈ P(dL |Lb, Tc, T) × P(dR |Lb, Tc, T) × flL




P(ccl |ccl−





1 , T)



(8)



Here Lb is the length (in characters) of the original recognized Chinese  NE Cb. Let dL and 
dR denote the left and  right distance,  respectively (which  are based  on the numbers of 
Chinese  characters), that  C shrinks/enlarges from  the left and  the right  boundaries of 
its anchor Cb. In Example  (1) in Section 2.1, in the case where the given  Cb and  C are
“北 韩 中 央” and  “韩 中 央 通 信 社”, respectively, then  dL and  dR are −1 and  +3, respec-
tively. Let String[C] denote the associated Chinese  string of C, ccl denote the l-th Chinese
character within that string,  and L denote the total number of Chinese  characters within
C. Then  we  will  have  a range  of bigram probabilities for  candidates with  different 
lengths. Therefore, it is systematically biased6 (in probability value) towards candidates
with  shorter lengths. On the English  side, following Equation (8), P(E|Eb, Te, T, Se) can
be derived similarly; the unit is a word, however, rather than  a character.



6 This bias is introduced by the conditional independence assumption made  while decomposing


P (String[C]|T) into flL


P(ccl |cc


l−1


, T).





    In summary, with  factors  dL and  dR , the proposed NE likelihood is able to assign 
scope  preference to each regenerated NE based  on its associated initial  NE. The initial 
NE therefore still plays  a role in the ﬁnal selection  process,  even after its related candi- 
date  set has been generated, which  is important when  all words involved are correctly 
matched to their  counterparts, as explained in Section  2.2. In contrast, Huang, Vogel, 
and Waibel (2003) adopt only type-dependent bigrams as the NE likelihood. The initial 
NE thus  will not play  any role in the ﬁnal selection  process  after its related candidate 
set has  been  generated. The scope  preference information carried by the  initial  NE is 
therefore not utilized in their model.
   Having integrated all  related probabilities (Equations (6), (7), and  (8)) together, 
we now  have  the ﬁnal desired model.  For simplicity, all the probabilities involved are 
estimated by the Good-Turing smoothing technique (Chen and  Goodman 1998) unless 
otherwise speciﬁed.


3.3 Framework for Jointly Identifying and Aligning Bilingual NEs

In jointly identifying and  aligning bilingual NEs, a three-stage framework is adopted: 
(A) Initial  NE Recognition, generating the  initial  NE anchors with  off-the-shelf pack- 
ages, (B) NE Candidate Set Expansion, expanding the associated NE Candidate set to 
remedy the errors  made  in the previous stage,  and  (C) NE Re-identiﬁcation & Align- 
ment,  extracting the  ﬁnal  NE pairs  from  the  Cartesian product of source  and  target 
candidate sets (created in the second  stage)  via a search  process.  Figure  1 presents the 
detailed procedure of this framework.




1    For each given bilingual sentence pair:
2	(A) Initial NE Recognition: The initial Chinese  NEs and English  NEs are ﬁrst identiﬁed by their 
corresponding NE recognition toolkits,  respectively.
3	(B) NE Candidate Set Expansion: To rescue  those NEs whose  boundaries are incorrectly identiﬁed in 
the previous stage—for  each initially  detected NE, several  NE candidates will be regenerated from the 
original NE by allowing its boundaries to be shrunk or enlarged within a pre-speciﬁed range.
4            (B.1) Create  both C and E candidate sets, which  are expanded from those initial NEs recognized in
the previous stage.
5	(B.2) Construct a NE pair candidate set (named NE-Pair-Candidate  set) by generating a Cartesian 
product of C and E candidate sets created in the above step.
6	(C) NE Re-identiﬁcation & Alignment: Rank each candidate in the NE-Pair-Candidate set constructed 
above with the score speciﬁed by the proposed model.  Let Nc and Ne be the numbers of those initial 
Chinese  and English NEs in the ﬁrst stage, respectively, and set K = min(Nc, Ne). Extract top K ﬁnal
NE pairs  (with their re-assigned NE types) with the highest scores from the NE-Pair-Candidate set.
7	(C.1) FOR each NE pair in the NE-Pair-Candidate set created above: 
FOR each re-assigned NE type within {PER, LOC, ORG}
Evaluate the score for the given candidate pair and the given NE type according to the 
proposed model.
END  FOR
Find the re-assigned NE type with the highest score, then attach  it and its corresponding 
score to the given NE pair
END  FOR (C.1)
8	(C.2) Conduct a beam search  process  to select the top K non-overlapping NE pairs  from the NE-Pair- 
Candidate set with the scores assigned above. The searching process  will keep removing those over- 
lapping NEs from the candidate list before each state is branched.

    Example  4 illustrates how  the framework works.  For simplicity, we will allow  the 
Chinese  NE to enlarge/shrink its boundaries to four characters on each side, and  only 
allow two words for English.



Example 4. An example of candidate  set construction

Each NE and its type in this example is separated by ”/”. Only partial and relevant 
information is shown here.
(A.1) 	A Chinese  tagged sentence:  “据 报 道(加 拉 巴 戈 斯/PER) 国 家 公 园 以 及 当 地 渔 民 ， 正
合.. .。”;
(A.2) 	Initial Chinese  NE (Cb): (加拉巴戈斯/PER), Nc = 1;
(A.3) 	An   English   tagged  sentence:    “The   report  said   the   [Galapagos/PER]  [National
Park/ORG] and local ﬁshermen were working together .. .”;
(A.4) 	Initial English NEs (Eb): [Galapagos/PER], [National Park / ORG], Ne = 2;
(B.1.1)	Regenerated Chinese  candidate set (CK ): {(加拉巴戈斯), (加拉巴戈斯国家公园), (加), 
(拉巴戈斯国家公园), (拉巴), (拉), (巴), (戈), (斯), (据报道加拉巴戈斯国家公园), (据报道 
加拉巴戈), ... .}. Total 62 C candidates will be generated.
(B.1.2)	Regenerated English  candidate set (EK ): {[Galapagos], [National Park], [Galapagos Na-
tional  Park], [said the Galapagos National Park], [National Park and  local], [National], 
[Park], .. .}. Total 24 E candidates will be generated.
(B.2)	NE-Pair-Candidate set: {(加拉巴戈斯)::[Galapagos], (加拉巴戈斯国家公园)::[Galapagos 
National Park],  (加拉巴戈斯)::[National  Park],  (加拉巴戈斯国家公园)::[Park], ..... .}. 
Total 1,488 (62 × 24) NE pairs  will be generated.
(C) 	K = min(Nc, Ne) = 1. Therefore, only  {(加 拉 巴 戈 斯 国 家 公 园)::[Galapagos   National
Park], ORG} will be extracted.


    This example shows  that the desired Chinese  NE (加拉巴戈斯国家公园) is partially 
recognized as (加 拉 巴 戈 斯) initially  with  an incorrect NE type  PER. In addition, the
desired English  NE [Galapagos National Park]  is split into [Galapagos] and  [National
Park],  initially  two  NEs. After each NE Candidate set has been expanded, the desired 
NEs (加 拉 巴 戈 斯 国 家 公 园) and  [Galapagos National Park]  are  included in C and  E 
candidate sets, respectively. The desired NE pair  {(加拉巴戈斯国家公园)::[Galapagos 
National Park], ORG} can thus  be located.
    If we allow  the boundaries to be enlarged/shrunk without any  limitation during 
the  expansion step,  all  NEs  that  are  initially  incorrectly recognized can  then  be  in- 
cluded. The generated search  space,  however, would be too  large  to be tractable. In 
our  observation, four  Chinese  characters for both  shrinking and  enlarging, and  two 
English  words for  shrinking and  three  for  enlarging, are  found to  be  adequate in 
most cases. (Note that  only the candidate that  contains at least one original character/ 
word is  allowed.) Under  this  condition, the  inclusion rates   for  NEs  with   correct 
boundaries can  be  increased to  94.6% (from  88.7%) for  Chinese,   and  96.3% (from
92.8%) for English,  respectively; the  NE pair  inclusion rate  can  even  be increased to
95.3% from  83.9%. Because  the  inclusion rate  achieved by this  strategy (with  limited 
range)  is  only  0.8% lower  than  that  obtained without any  range  limitation (which 
is 96.1%, as  some  NEs  might  have  been  completely missed in  the  ﬁrst  stage),  this 
setting  is adopted in this article  to reduce the search  space.  Even with  this expansion 
strategy, however, those  missing and  spurious (false positive) errors  still cannot  be 
remedied, because  we  will  neither create  additional anchors nor  delete  any  existing 
anchor.





4. Experiments on Various Conﬁgurations

To evaluate the  proposed approach, prior  work  (Huang, Vogel,  and  Waibel  2003) is 
re-implemented as our  baseline  (see Section  4.2). This  is because  the  work  not  only 
adopts the same  candidate set expansion strategy mentioned previously, but  also uti- 
lizes monolingual information when  selecting  NE pairs  (only a simple  bigram model  is 
used, however). This is in contrast to other works  (Feng, Lv, and Zhou 2004; Lee, Chang, 
and Jang 2006), which  only used  alignment scores.
    The  same  training and  test  sets  are  used  for  the  various experiment conﬁgura- 
tions.  The adopted training set  includes two  parts.  The ﬁrst  part  consists  of 110,874 
aligned sentence pairs from newswire data in the Foreign Broadcast Information Service 
(LDC2003E147 ) corpus, which  is denoted as Training Set I. The average length  of the 
Chinese  sentences in  this  data  set  is 74.6 characters, and  the  average length  of the 
English  sentences is 30.2 words. Training Set I is initially  tagged by Chinese/English 
NE taggers, and  then  reference NE boundaries and  types  are  manually labeled.  The 
second  part  of the training set is the LDC2005T348  bilingual NE pair  list with  a total 
of 218,772 NE pairs,  which  is denoted as Training Set II. The required features (e.g., 
NE type and  translation-mode) are then manually labeled  throughout the two training 
sets. Because Training Set II only contains isolated NE pairs that are not associated with 
their  surrounding context,  Training Set I is thus  required to train  those  context-related 
parameters.
    In the baseline  system,  translation cost and  transliteration cost models are trained 
on  Training Set II, and  tagging cost  is trained on  Training Set I. For  the  proposed 
approach, the NE likelihoods are trained on Training Set I, and Training Set II is used  to 
train the parameters relating to the NE alignment probability.
    For the test set, 300 sentence pairs  are randomly selected  from the Linguistic Data 
Consortium (LDC) Chinese–English News  Text (LDC2005T06) corpus, which  contains 
at least one NE pair  in each sentence. The average length  of Chinese  sentences is 59.4 
characters, and  the  average length   of English  sentences is 24.8 words. The  answer 
keys  to NE recognition and  alignment are annotated manually, and  used  as the  gold 
standard to calculate  the  metrics  of precision (P), recall  (R), and  F-score  (F) for both 
NE recognition and  alignment. A total  of 765 Chinese  NEs  and  747 English  NEs  are 
manually identiﬁed in the test set, in which  there  are 718 reference NE pairs  (including
214 PER pairs,  371 LOC pairs,  and  133 ORG pairs).  NE alignment result  is a subset  of
NE recognition results, because  not all those recognized NEs can be aligned.
    The development set for feature selection  and  weight training is composed of 200 
sentence pairs  selected  from  the  LDC2005T06 corpus, which  includes 482 manually 
tagged NE pairs.  The average length  of Chinese  sentences is 56.4 characters, and  the 
average length  of English  sentences is 23.2 words. There  is no  overlap between the 
training, development, and test sets.
    These  data  sets  will  be  adopted in  a  series  of experiments that  investigate the 
proposed model.  Among them,  the results of initial  NE recognition are given  in Sec- 
tion 4.1, and those related to the baseline  system  are given in Section 4.2. In Section 4.3, 
a series of experiments are conducted to examine the effect of various features adopted 
in the  proposed model.  The weighted version of the  proposed model  is also  tested.

Furthermore, the effectiveness of adopting different initial  NE recognizers is shown in 
Section  4.4, and  the  effectiveness of the  proposed model  across  different domains is 
illustrated in Section 4.5. Finally, the result  of directly using  all available features under 
a Maximum Entropy framework without developing a principled model  is given  in 
Section 4.6.

4.1 Initial NE Recognizers

Both  the  baseline  alignment system  and  the  proposed model  share  the  same  Initial 
NE  Recognition subtask. The  systems adopt the  Chinese  NE  recognizer reported in 
Wu, Zhao,  and  Xu (2005), which  is a hybrid statistical model  incorporating multi- 
knowledge sources,  and  the English  NE recognizer included in the publicly available 
Mallet  toolkit9  (McCallum 2002) to generate initial  NEs.  These  two  initial  NE recog- 
nizers  are  adopted because  their  performance is comparable to other  state-of-the-art 
systems (Gao, Li, Wu, and Huang 2005; Zhou and Su 2006). The NE recognition baseline 
performances reported subsequently are provided by these two packages. A total of 789
Chinese  NEs and 752 English NEs are recognized.
    Table 2 shows  the initial  NE recognition (NER) performance for both  Chinese  and 
English  (the  highest performance in each  column is in bold).  It is observed that  the 
F-score of ORG type  is the lowest  among all NE types  for both  English  and  Chinese. 
This is because  many  organization names  are only partially recognized or missed alto- 
gether.  In addition, the precision rate of PER type is lowest  among all English  NE types 
because  many  location  names  or abbreviated organization names  tend  to be incorrectly 
recognized as person names  in English. In general, the initial Chinese  NER outperforms 
the  initial  English  NER, as the  NE type  classiﬁcation turns out  to be a more  difﬁcult 
problem for this English NER system.

4.2 The Baseline  System

The model  of Huang, Vogel, and Waibel (2003) is re-implemented in our environment as 
the baseline  system,  and is brieﬂy sketched here for the reader ’s convenience. There are 
three cost features in Huang’s alignment model: (1) transliteration cost, which measures 
the phonetic similarity of the aligned NEs; (2) translation cost, which  is similar  to IBM 
model-1  (Brown et al. 1993); and  (3) tagging cost, which  evaluates bigram probabilities 
of the aligned NEs based  on the same NE type.

   In our experiments, the translation cost of the baseline  system  is trained on Training 
Set I (with  110,874 aligned sentence pairs)  by the GIZA++  toolkit  (Och and  Ney 2003), 
the transliteration cost is trained on all person names  (all are transliterated) and translit- 
erated location  and  organization names  included in Training Set II. The tagging cost is 
trained on the tagging result  of Training Set I by the initial NE detection system.
    When  those  initially  identiﬁed NEs are directly used  for alignment, only  a 64.1% 
F-score (regarding their NE types)  is obtained from this baseline  system.  This relatively 
poor  performance is mainly due  to errors  in the  initial  NE recognition stage  that  are 
brought into  the  subsequent alignment stage.  To diminish the  accumulative effect of 
errors,  the same expansion strategy described in Section 3.3 is then  adopted to enlarge 
the possible  NE candidate set. However, only a slight  improvement is obtained (from
64.1% to 68.4% for type-sensitive F-score), as shown in Table 3 in Section 4.3. Therefore, 
it is conjectured that  the  baseline  alignment model  is unable to perform well  if the 
features proposed in this article are not adopted.


4.3 The Re-identiﬁcation and Alignment Joint Model

To examine the  individual effect of features adopted in the model,  a series  of experi- 
ments  are ﬁrst conducted on the development set. All features mentioned in Section 3 
are veriﬁed by their contributions and are then adopted for further experiments on the 
test  set. Table 3 lists only  the  representative performance of NE alignment (NEA) on 
the  test  set, and  gives  two  performance measures for the  experiments. The ﬁrst  one 
(named type-insensitive) only checks the scope of each NE without taking its associated 
NE type  into account (which  is the approach adopted in most  of the literature on NE 
recognition), and  is reported as the  main  metric  in Table  3. The second  one  (named 
type-sensitive) also evaluates the associated NE type of each NE. To evaluate the type- 
sensitive performance for NE pairs  with  correct  boundaries, we give one point  to any 
NE pair  that  also possesses the correct  type-tags on both  sides,  and  give 0.5% if only 
one side  is correct.  Of course,  zero  points  are given  if both  types  are incorrect or the 
boundary of any  NE  is incorrect. With  the  rules  speciﬁed herein,  the  type-sensitive 
results are  also  given  within the  parentheses in  Table  3, and  a large  degradation  is 
observed. The conﬁgurations of various experiments are listed as follows.


ExpB: This  is  the  baseline  system  (Huang,  Vogel,  and   Waibel   2003),  which   is  re- 
implemented in our environment for comparison.
Exp1: Exp1 (named B-Probabilities) adopts all bilingual related probabilities involved in
Equations (6) and (7), to show  the full power of bilingual probabilities.





Exp2: Furthermore, because  the NE alignment probability would favor the candidates 
with fewer components,10 it is further normalized by converting Equation (6) into 
the following form:



 N
	A


  1 	
 NA



max
A


n P(cpA,a(n) |MA,n , 
ewA,n , T) × P(MA,n 
|ewA,n , T)
  n=1


× P(δA |T)




The experiment covering complete bilingual probabilities, with  the normalized 
versions of Equations (6) and  (7), is denoted as  Exp2  (named B-Probabilities 
N-Alignment).
Table 3 indicates that  Exp2 achieves  the best performance (both type-insensitive 
and  type-sensitive) among different combinations of the bilingual-related prob- 
abilities.  Due to its effectiveness, the normalized bilingual probabilities are hence 
adopted in all subsequent experiments (i.e., all are based  on Exp2).
Exp3: Exp3 (named N-Full Model) manifests the full power of the proposed recognition
and  alignment joint  model,  by integrating all monolingual options into  Exp2. 
Note  that  we  use  the  SRI Language Modeling Toolkit11   (Stolcke  2002) to train 
various character-/word-based  bigram models on different NE types.  They are 
trained with  modiﬁed Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser  and  Ney 1995, Chen  and 
Goodman 1998). Note  that  monolingual bigrams are also normalized with  their 
numbers.

    As Exp3 shows,  the best conﬁguration is to take advantage of all features proposed 
in this article and  to normalize all feature probabilities. This conﬁguration will thus  be 
taken  for further improvement in the following sections.
    So far the proposed model  weighs all features equally. It is reasonable to expect that 
features should be weighted differently according to their contribution, however. Those 
weighting coefﬁcients  can  be learned from  the  development set  via  the  well-known 
Minimum Error Rate Training approach (Schlu¨ ter and Ney 2001; Och 2003) (commonly 
abbreviated as MERT). To save  computational cost, we only  re-evaluate the  scores  of 
candidate pairs  in a pre-generated pool,  instead of regenerating new  candidate pairs 
each time when  Wt (the vector  of weighting coefﬁcients  at i-th iteration) is updated to 
Wt+1 (of the next iteration). For each sentence pair, its corresponding pool is ﬁrst created
by using W0 (i.e., Exp3) to generate the top 50 NE pairs12 resulting from the beam search
process.  Subsequently, when  we switch  Wt to Wt+1 , we only re-score (and then re-rank)
those candidate pairs  inside  the pool according to Wt+1 .
Exp 4 presents the  weighted version of the  proposed joint  model  obtained from
MERT training (MERT-W, N-Full Model, abbreviated as MERT-W). The result  demon- 
strates that MERT is effective and useful.  Entries  in bold indicate that the model  signif- 
icantly  outperforms the baseline  system.  (All statistical signiﬁcance tests in this article 
are measured with  95% conﬁdence level on 1,000 re-sampling batches  [Zhang, Vogel, 
and Waibel 2004]).





10 It is biased  by the E word-count due to the sufﬁciency (Freedman 2005; Liese and Miescke 2008)
assumption made  during decomposition.
11 http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/.
12 Because most sentence pairs possess  less than four NE pairs under Exp3, 50 NE pairs should be sufﬁcient.

   Compared to the  baseline  system,  the  MERT-W version has  substantially raised 
the test set type-insensitive F-score of identiﬁed NE pairs  from  78.4% to 87.1% (11.1% 
relative   improvement), and  the  type-sensitive F-score  from  68.4% to  81.7% (19.4% 
relative  improvement). Therefore, this MERT-W version is adopted in all further 
experiments.


4.4 Effect of Adopting Different Initial NE Recognizers

To study whether the  ﬁnal  performance of NE alignment is sensitive to the choice  of 
initial  NE recognizers, we investigate the ﬁnal alignment performance across  different 
Chinese  and English NE recognizers.
    First, we test the NE alignment performance with  the same Chinese  NE recognizer 
(Wu’s system,  adopted earlier)  but  with  different English  NE recognizers that  include 
the  Mallet  toolkit  (used  before),  the  Stanford NE  recognizer (Finkel,  Grenager, and 
Manning 2005), and  Minor Third  (Cohen  2004). Table 4 shows  the type-insensitive and 
type-sensitive (within parentheses) results. Table 5 shows  the effect on NE alignment 
performance. From Tables 4 and  5, we ﬁnd  that  NE alignment performance is actually 
not  sensitive to the NE recognition result.  Although the  performance of different NE 
recognizers are various (type-insensitive13 F-scores are 90.1%, 92.1%, and  92.5%, re- 
spectively), the  gaps  among their  corresponding NE alignment results are  negligible 
(type-sensitive F-scores of weighted versions are 81.7%, 81.4%, and 81.4%, respectively), 
as their  candidate sets are enlarged based  on initially  recognized NEs. It is also note- 
worthy that  although the  F-score  of the  Stanford NE  recognizer is higher than  that 
of the  Mallet  toolkit,  its corresponding NE alignment performance is lower  than  the 
model  based  on the Mallet  toolkit.  We conjecture that  the lower  recall of Stanford NE



13 Because the initial NE recognizer mainly provides NE anchors, NE type is less relevant to the following 
alignment.

recognizer leads to lower NE alignment performance because the recall of NER is closely 
related to the  NE pair  inclusion rate  (please  refer  to footnote 1), which  is the  upper 
bound of its corresponding NE alignment performance.
    Similarly,  we  test  the  NE alignment performance with  the  same  English  NE rec- 
ognizer (Mallet) but with  different Chinese  NE recognizers, including Wu’s system  (as 
before), BaseNER (Zhao  and  Kit 2008), and  S-MSRSeg (Gao, Li, Wu, and  Huang 2005). 
The comparisons are  given  in Tables  6 and  7. From  these  tables  we  also see that  the 
NE alignment result  is not sensitive to the NE recognition result  (84.1% to 87.4% type- 
insensitive for NER vs. 80.1% to 81.7% type-sensitive in F-score for NEA), although the 
performance of NE alignment is related to the recall of the Chinese  NE recognizer (the 
weaker side).  We also note  that  the  type-insensitive F-score  performance gap  among 
various English NE recognizers in Table 5 is less than that of the Chinese  NE recognizers 
in Table 7 (0.2% vs. 1.3%), which is mainly due to the different gaps among their original 
performances (2.4% vs. 3.3%, shown by Tables 4 and 6).
   Furthermore, NE alignment based  on the worst  Chinese  NE recognizer (S-MSRSeg) 
and the worst English NE recognizer (Minor Third) is conducted in Table 8. From Table 8 
we see that the ﬁnal NE alignment performance is primarily determined by the weaker 
side,  which  is the  one  that  gives  the  lower  recognition recall  rate.  In this  particular 
case, the performance of the combination of S-MSRSeg and  Minor  Third  (79.9% type- 
sensitive F-score) is mainly driven by the performance of the Chinese  S-MSRSeg (80.1%

in  Table  7). This  is because  the  NE  pair  inclusion rate  is usually dominated by  the 
weaker side.

4.5 Effectiveness of the Proposed Model Across Different Domains

To test  the  effectiveness of the  joint model  across  domains, we  compare the  baseline 
and  our  joint  model   on  three  different domains (News,   HK  Hansards, and  Com- 
puter  Technology). To  do  this,  two  other  test  sets  are  selected   from  HK  Hansards 
(LDC2004T08) and  from  the  computer domain (training data  in CWMT08),14  respec- 
tively  (the  test  set used  in the  previous sections  is from  the  News  domain). Each  of 
these new test sets also includes 300 randomly selected  sentence pairs.
    Table 9 shows  the  initial  NE recognition performance across  those  three  different 
domains. Also, it is clear from Table 10 that our joint model  outperforms the baseline  in 
all three  domains, which  indicates that  the  advantage of our  joint  model  holds  over 
various domains. On  the  other  hand, the  smaller  improvement observed in the  HK 
Hansards domain might  be due to the possibly easier task of initial NE recognition and 
NE alignment.15  (Note  that  the  baseline  performance in this  domain is much  higher 
than  others—with an  NE  alignment type-sensitive F-score  of 83.7% compared with



14 http://nlpr-web.ia.ac.cn/cwmt-2008.
15 Note that 40.3% sentence pairs  in the HK Hansards corpus contains only one NE pair (alignment would 
be trivial in this case); this ratio is 15.7% and 27.0% for News  and Computer domains, respectively.

68.4% and 70.3% in News  and Computer domains, respectively). Therefore, those novel 
features of our joint model  are not crucial in easy cases.

4.6 Maximum Entropy Framework with Primitive Features

We propose and  derive  the  model  described previously in a principled manner. One 
might wonder, however, whether it is worthwhile to derive such a model after all related 
features have  been  proposed, as all proposed features can also be directly integrated 
into  the  well-known maximum entropy (ME) framework (Berger,  Della  Pietra,  and 
Della  Pietra  1996) without making any  assumptions. To show  that  not  only  features, 
but  also  the  adopted model  contributes to  performance improvement, we  build  an 
ME model  that directly adopts all primitive features mentioned previously as its input 
(including the internal component alignment-pair, initial and ﬁnal NE type, NE bigram- 
based   string,   and   left/right  distance), without  involving any  related  probabilities 
derived in the proposed model.
    Because  an ME approach can be trained only  on linked  NE pairs,  those  sentence 
pairs  that  include at least one NE pair  are ﬁrst extracted from Training Set I. A total of
90,412 sentence pairs  are obtained, as some sentence pairs  only have  either  Chinese  or 
English NEs, and 298,302 NE pairs are identiﬁed. This ME method is implemented with 
the YASMET16 package, and is tested under various training-set sizes (400, 4,000, 40,000, 
and 90,412 sentence pairs). Because the NEs of the bilingual NE pair list (Training Set II) 
do  not  contain  their  corresponding  sentences, the  ME approach lacks  the  necessary 
context  to extract  speciﬁc ME features and hence this list is left out of our training data 
for both the baseline  ME model  and our joint model.
    In order  to compare different ME approaches, we also try  Zhang’s  Maxent  pack- 
age17  with ﬁve classes (i.e., PER, LOC, ORG, Incorrect-Boundaries, Correct-Boundaries- 
Incorrect-Type). A ﬁve-class  approach outperforms a three-class approach (YASMET) 
in this case (it has many  more  features as well). Table 11 shows  only the type-sensitive 
F-scores evaluated on the same  test set to save space. The data  within the parentheses 
are  relative  improvements, and  entries  in bold  indicate that  the  performance of the 
derived model  is statistically better  than that of the ME models.
    The improvement indicated in Table 11 clearly illustrates the beneﬁt  of deriving the 
model.  Because a reasonably derived model  not only shares  the same training set with 
the  primitive ME approach, but  also enjoys  the  additional knowledge introduced by 
the human researcher (i.e., the assumptions/constraints implied by the model),  it is not 
surprising that a good model does perform well, and the relative  improvement becomes 
more noticeable when  the training set becomes  smaller.



16 http://www.fjoch.com/YASMET.html.
17 http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/lzhang10/maxent toolkit.html.





    When we take a closer look at the 18 instances where our model  correctly  identiﬁes 
the NE alignments and  Maxent  fails to do so on the test set, we ﬁnd  that  the internal 
component alignment-pair feature in the Maxent  approach to be dominant in causing
56% of the errors  (10 out of 18). In contrast, our corresponding internal mapping prob- 
ability  P(cpa(n) |Mn , ewn , T) in Equation (5) makes  the correct  decisions 90% of the time 
(9 out of 10). In fact, even P(cpa(n) |ewn , T) (the simpler form) makes  correct  predictions
80% of the time (8 out of 10).
One example of the ten errors  made  by Maxent  is “玻利维亚举行” (Bolivia holds),
which  is incorrectly linked  to Bolivia holds as a NE pair  by the ME approach, whereas 
our  model  correctly  aligns  “玻 利 维 亚” with  Bolivia. This  is because  “玻 利 维 亚” is 
transliterated into  Bolivia, but  “举 行” is translated into  holds. Given  T = LOC, the  in- 
ternal mapping probability P(cpa(n) |ewn , T) thus disfavors the translation mode between 
“举 行” and  hold within an LOC NE pair,  and  prefers the  correct  result.  This example
illustrates the utility of the explicit dependency constraint imposed by the model, which 
is not possible  in the ME approach.


5. Discussion and Error Analysis

Although the proposed model substantially improves alignment performance, errors do 
remain. Therefore, we would like to know  what  the limitations of the proposed model 
are, and what  kinds  of problems still remain—an essential component in ﬁnding future 
directions for further improvements. In the test set, a total of 718 NE reference-pairs and
739 aligned NE pairs  are generated from the proposed joint model  (MERT-W version). 
Among the generated NE pairs, there are 104 (out of 739) boundary errors (regardless of 
their re-assigned types), or 14.1%. Also, among the remaining 635 NE pairs with correct 
boundaries, 41 (6.5%) are re-assigned to the incorrect NE type. Boundary identiﬁcation, 
therefore, is still a crucial problem.
    Before investigating the errors  made  by MERT-W, we would like to understand its 
limits. As mentioned in Section 3.3, the inclusion rate of those desired NE pairs  (within 
the Cartesian product of expanded candidate sets CK and  EK ) is the upper bound for
1 	1
the  system  adopted in the  ﬁnal  selection  stage,  which  in the  current setting  is 95.3%.
In comparison, the type-insensitive F-score of MERT-W is 87.1%, indicating that  there 
is still a signiﬁcant 8.2% scope for improvement, even though a great improvement has 
already been made over the baseline system. We examine this gap and propose solutions 
to address the errors  in the following section.


5.1 Classiﬁcation of Type-Insensitive NE Pair Errors

There are 111 type-insensitive NE pair errors  in the test set (104 boundary errors  plus 7 
others not included in the output list due to missing anchors), and these can be classiﬁed 
into the following six main categories.


(I)	Reference Inconsistency (11%): The NE references from Chinese  and English 
are not correctly  matched, which  rules out the possibility of generating the 
correct NE pair.

(II)	Missing Anchor (14%): Although the NE reference is consistent, not all their 
associated NE anchors are generated in the initial recognition stage, which 
cannot  be remedied by the expansion strategy adopted in this article.





(III)	Over-generating Anchors (10%): Similarly,  additional spurious NE anchors 
are also generated in the initial recognition stage, and result  in incorrect 
NE pairs.

The  remaining  cases  with   correct   corresponding  anchors are  further classiﬁed   as 
follows.

(IV)	Inconsistent Components (12%): Although their corresponding anchors are 
correctly  generated, the internal components of those reference pairs  are 
originally unmatched due to deletions or insertions occurring in the NE
translation. For example, in the reference {(乌伯林更镇)::[Berlingen]}, the
Chinese  component “镇” (town) is originally unmatched because  its
English correspondent town does not exist in the given English sentence. 
Therefore, only one incorrect pair {(乌伯林更)::[Berlingen]} is generated.
Other  cases with all matched components are further classiﬁed  in the 
following.

(V)	Expansion Limitation (5%): Even though all the internal components are 
matched, the desired candidate (i.e., the reference) is still not covered by the 
candidate set after its expansion.

(VI)	Others (48%): Even if all internal components are matched and their 
references are also included in the candidate set, some errors  still remain, 
mainly due to the limitations of the current model.  These cases account for 
the majority of the errors  that will be further analyzed subsequently in the 
article.
    Table  12 shows  the  distribution of the  six deﬁned categories. {(CNE)::[ENE]} is 
a speciﬁed NE pair,  and  the unmatched components are underlined. The numbers in

parentheses in the  last  column denote the  number of NE pairs  of the  corresponding 
category. Among all categories, Category (I) errors  (Reference  Inconsistency, 11%) are 
irrelevant to the alignment model,  and  are attributed to the asymmetrical distribution 
of bilingual NEs (corresponding NEs might  sometimes be missed or replaced by the
pronoun it). As illustrated in Table 12, CNE “佛塞特” (Fossett) is initially  recognized as
“塞特” and ﬁnally linked to an irrelevant ENE Northam (诺森). This occurs because  their
corresponding counterparts Fossett and  “诺森” do not appear in the original sentence
pair,  and  our  alignment model  assumes that  the  linking  between NEs  is a  one-to-
one  mapping. One  possible  simple  solution would be to set a minimal threshold on 
alignment scores that ﬁlters out such spurious linking.  This may introduce the risk that 
some correct NE pairs  might  be pruned away  at the same time, however.
Category (II) errors  (Missing  Anchor,  14%) are due to the absence  of the associated
NE anchors in the initial recognition stage. As an example in Table 12, the corresponding 
anchor  of the  Chinese  NE  “东 协” (ASEAN) is not  initially  identiﬁed. Because  each
candidate set is generated from the given  anchor, a missing anchor  implies  that its 
associated candidate set will  not  exist,  thereby making it impossible to generate the 
corresponding NE pair.  Although increasing the number of output anchors generated 
from   the  initial   recognition  stage   can  relieve   this  problem,  doing   so  makes   the 
subsequent alignment task harder. Additionally, the spurious anchors generated might 
introduce even more errors.
    The errors  in Category (III) (Over-generating Anchors, 10%) are  due  to spurious 
anchors generated in the  initial  recognition stage.  For instance, the  CNE “李 南 信” is
originally aligned with the ENE Lee Nam-shin by transliteration. A spurious ENE South is 
also identiﬁed in the initial stage, however. This spurious ENE South is then incorrectly
linked  to a virtual CNE with the highest score, “南,” which is a sub-string of the desired
CNE “李南信,” and  also a Chinese  translation for south. This prevents the correct  NE
pair  from  being  generated. Both  missing and  over-generating anchor   problems are
largely  dependent on the NE recognition toolkits  adopted in the initial stage. Using the 
current expansion strategy, the initial  NE recognizers with  lower  recall  (or precision) 
tend  to result  in worse  NE-pair recall (or precision) in the ﬁnal alignment stage.
   Category (IV) errors  (Inconsistent Components, 12%) are caused by internal com- 
ponents within NEs that  were  not  originally matched. Because  words in NEs are not 
always translated literally,  there  are  insertions and  deletions during NE  translation. 
As  an  example, shown  in  Table  12 and  illustrated previously, the  incorrect result
{(乌伯林更)::[Berlingen]} is generated for its reference {(乌伯林更镇)::[Berlingen]}, as
its Chinese  component “镇” (town) is originally unmatched. In the  worse  case, those
unmatched components could interleave with matched components within the NE pair,
and  thus  prevent some  matched components from  being  included. For  example, in 
the  reference {(欧盟执行委 员 会)::[European Commission]}, both  the Chinese  compo- 
nents  “盟” (alliance) and  “执行” (execution) have no counterparts, and  they would have 
prevented the matched portion {(委员会)::[Commission]} from  being  included in the 
ﬁnal output. As a result,  only {(欧)::[European]} is eventually extracted. To tackle this
problem of component insertions/deletions that  sometimes occur  in English–Chinese
translation, the alignment model should be further enhanced to allow the component to 
be linked  to an empty element, NULL. Introducing this freedom, however, might  have 
the side effect of including additional spurious Chinese  characters (or English  words). 
Further study is required to justify this idea; given  that  this category accounts for only
12% of the errors,  we propose to defer this for later studies.
   Furthermore, Category (V) errors  (Expansion Limitation, 5%) are caused by the 
problem that  the  desired candidate (i.e., reference) is excluded during the  candidate





set expansion stage. Table 12 shows  that the ﬁnal output of the reference {(英国葛兰素 
史克美占药厂)::[British Pharmaceutical Firm GlaxoSmithKline]} is {(英国)::[British]}. 
This reference has three  Chinese  initial  anchors: “英国” (British), “葛兰素” (Glaxo) and 
“史克美” (SmithKline), and  it also has two  English  initial  anchors: British Pharmaceuti-
cal and  Firm GlaxoSmithKline. Because  only  four  characters are allowed for boundary 
enlarging/shrinking for Chinese  anchors (three  words for English  anchors), the refer- 
ence CNE is beyond the scope of any Chinese  initial anchor  during the expansion stage. 
Therefore, it could  not be included in the candidate set for ﬁnal selection.  In addition,
the adjacent Chinese  component “葛兰素” could not be recovered due to the translation
re-ordering of the Chinese  components—its counterpart Glaxo is far apart from British
in the given  sentence. Similarly,  the adjacent English  words Pharmaceutical Firm could 
not be recovered, as its counterpart “药厂” is far apart  from “英国.” Although loosening
the constraint during the expansion stage  can increase  the reference coverage, it must 
be weighed against the corresponding lower  precision.
    Finally,  for those  NE pairs  with  aligned components and  included references, the 
proposed model  still makes  a signiﬁcant number of mistakes. These  kinds  of errors, 
Category (VI) (Others,  48%), account for the  largest  portion among all errors.  There- 
fore, they  are further hierarchically classiﬁed  in Table 13 according to their  associated 
transformation types  and origins.
    The incorrect NE pairs  with  aligned components and  included references (i.e., [VI] 
Other  Category in Table 12) are ﬁrst  classiﬁed by their  corresponding transformation 
types:  (VI.A) Abnormal Transformation (27%), whose  transformation types  are  not  as- 
sumed by the model  (i.e., neither normally translated nor normally transliterated); and 
(VI.B) Normal Transformation (21%), whose  components are either  normally translated 
or normally transliterated. A detailed explanation is given as follows.

    (VI.A) Abnormal  Transformation  (27%): This  category includes transformation 
types  that  are  not  assumed by  our  alignment model.  It can  be further divided into 
three classes according to their origins: (VI.A.1) English Acronym (11%), whose ENE is an 
acronym; (VI.A.2) Chinese Abbreviation (8%), whose CNE is an abbreviation; and (VI.A.3) 
Irregular Translation (8%), whose  components are transformed neither semantically nor 
phonetically. These cases are interesting and are illustrated herein.
In the  row  (VI.A.1) (English  Acronym, 11%) of Table  13, a Chinese  NE “国 际 刑
事 法 庭” (International Criminal Court) is tagged as  “国 际 刑 事 法 庭/ORG,” whereas
its English  counterpart is the  acronym ICC. Linking  “国 际 刑 事 法 庭” to ICC is thus
beyond the ability  of our model.  On the other  hand, Chinese  NEs are also occasionally 
abbreviated. For example, in Class (VI.A.2) (Chinese  Abbreviation, 8%), “维和” is the 
Chinese   abbreviation of  “维 持 和 平”  (Peace-keeping),  which  is  also  difﬁcult to  align
to its English  counterpart. Such  acronym and  abbreviation cases  are  not  rare  in NE 
translation. We believe that an expansion table (or even anaphora analysis) for acronyms 
and abbreviations can help handle such issues.
    It is also  known that  some  loanwords or out-of-vocabulary terms  are  translated 
neither semantically nor phonetically. As an example for Class (VI.A.3) (Irregular Trans-
lation,  8%), CNE  “明 仁” (which  is the  name  of a Japanese emperor, and  consists  of
Japanese kanji  characters) is incorrectly linked  to  an  English  word Hirohito (whose 
Chinese  translation should be “昭 和”), although it should be linked  to ENE Akihito. 
In this  example, the  Japanese kanji  “明 仁” is directly adopted as the  corresponding
Chinese  characters (as those  characters are originally borrowed from  Chinese), which 
would be pronounced as ming-ren in Chinese  and  thus  deviates signiﬁcantly from  the 
English  pronunciation of Akihito. Therefore, it is translated neither semantically nor 
phonetically. This phenomenon mainly occurs in loanwords or out-of-vocabulary terms 
and the model would have to be extended to cover those new conversion types. Such an 
extension is very likely to be language-pair dependent (e.g., with an additional Japanese 
phonetic table for cases such as the given example), however.
    (VI.B) Normal  Transformation  (21%): Components of this category are translated 
normally. It can be further divided into two classes according to their  sources:  (VI.B.1) 
Bias from NE likelihoods (18%), which  prefers the  incorrect NE  pair  scope  due  to  its 
associated monolingual likelihood scores,  and  (VI.B.2) Bias from Bilingual Probabilities 
(3%), which  introduces extra non-NE  words in the output due to high alignment scores 
of words that are adjacent  to the NE. Further illustration is given as follows.
    As Class (VI.B.1) (Bias from NE likelihoods, 18%) shows  in Table 13, the Chinese  NE 
“南北 韩” and  the  English  NE South and North Koreas are  initially  recognized as “韩”
(Korea)  and  North Koreas,  respectively; the  model  ﬁnally  chooses  a partial alignment 
result  {(北 韩)::[North  Koreas]}.  In this  case,  every  component in either  the  CNE  or
the  ENE is well  matched to its counterpart. Therefore, there  is no  signiﬁcant differ- 
ence among the alignment scores  of various NE pair  candidates with  different scopes
(such  as {(韩)::[Koreas]}, {(北 韩)::[North  Koreas]}, and  {(南北 韩)::[South and  North
Koreas]}, etc.)
    The same  situation also appears in the transliteration case. For example, the ﬁnal 
output of the reference {(毕翠克丝)::[Beatrix]} is {(毕翠克)::[Beatrix]}, and  it has two 
Chinese  initial  anchors: “毕 翠” (pronounced as bi-cui in Chinese)  and  “克 丝” (ke-si).
According to the  training data,  both  “克” (ke) and  “克 丝” (ke-si) could  be aligned to
the English  letter x. There is no signiﬁcant difference, therefore, in the alignment scores 
between {(毕翠克)::[Beatrix]} and {(毕翠克丝)::[Beatrix]}.
    Because the NE alignment feature has only negligible discrimination power in these 
cases (as described in Section  2.2), monolingual likelihood scores  dominate the scope





preference. Addressing  this  shortcoming is  beyond the  capability of  the  alignment 
model,  and  the adjacent  contextual (non-NE)  bigrams, to be proposed later,  can only 
correct  5 of the 20 errors  in this  class. No easy  and  effective  solution for this  kind  of 
problem can currently be found.
Contrary to this  case, Class (VI.B.2) (Bias from Bilingual Probabilities, 3%) accounts
for  those   cases  where  incorrect NE  pairs   are  selected   due   to  the  bilingual  align- 
ment  score. For example, the ﬁnal  output of the reference {(世界杯)::[World Cup]} is
{(世界杯冠军)::[championship at World  Cup]}. Although both  desired CNE and  ENE
have  already been correctly  recognized in the initial  stage, the bilingual NE alignment 
feature prefers to include the  additional Chinese  common noun  “冠军” and  an extra
English word championship, because they are a perfect mutual translation. At ﬁrst glance, 
it seems  that  we could  use  the lower  casing  of championship as a feature. Other  refer-
ences  with  lower  case words could  also be found (e.g., {(世 贸 组织 部 长 会 议)::[WTO
ministerial meeting]}),  however. Therefore, additional features such  as their  relative
positions are also required.
    The  same  situation also  occurs  in  transliteration. For  example, the  Chinese  NE 
“伊 斯 兰 堡”  (yi-si-lan-bao,  in  Chinese   pronunciation) and  the  English  NE  Islamabad
are  both  correctly  recognized in the  initial  stage.  The model  chooses  a longer  align- 
ment  result  {(伊 斯 兰 堡 地)::[Islamabad]} in the  ﬁnal  stage,  however. In this  case, the 
Chinese  character “地”  (land,  pronounced as  di in  Chinese)  could  also  be  phoneti-
cally  aligned to syllable  “d”  with  high  probability. Therefore, there  is no  signiﬁcant 
difference in  the  alignment scores  between (伊 斯 兰 堡)::[Islamabad] and  (伊 斯 兰 堡 
地)::[Islamabad]. We may  need  to resort  to using  a richer  bilingual context  (i.e., “在 
伊 斯 兰 堡 地 图 上 …”; In the map of Islamabad .. .) as features to resolve  this issue.  If its
Chinese  adjacent contextual word “地图” (map, pronounced as di-tu) could  be aligned 
to the corresponding English  word map, and  given  that  “地 图” and  map are common
nouns in their  respective languages, it is possible  to determine that  this extra  Chinese 
character “地” should not be linked  to the ENE Islamabad.
   Addressing these problems requires that both translation and transliteration models 
be more complex  and  must  use additional features (possibly knowledge-rich features). 
Because this class accounts for only 3% of the errors,  we leave  the problem for future 
work.

5.1.1 Features Contributing to Boundary Errors. Among the 111 alignment errors analyzed,
76 of them18  have  their  references covered by the expanded candidate set. The scores 
of their  associated features are then  further inspected to determine which  features 
contribute to the  errors.  This  is assessed by counting the  number of times  (denoted 
by #Worst) that  a speciﬁc  weighted feature-score gets the worst  difference when  those 
incorrect NE  pairs  are  compared to  their  corresponding  references. A large  #Worst 
would imply  that  this  feature should get  more  attention in pursuing further perfor- 
mance  improvement.
    The top  four  related statistics are given  in Table 14, which  indicates that  F1 (Nor- 
malized TS/TL  Transformation) is the most  dominant feature in making those  errors. 
Following this,  F2 (Normalized Translation Mode),  F7 (Normalized Chinese  Bigram), 
and F10 (Normalized English Bigram) are on the second  tier. Both F1 and F2 are related 
to alignment, which  coincides with  our  observation that  alignment-related Categories

(76= 11 + 13+ 53 − 1), as one reference in Category (III) cannot  be found after expansion.

(i.e., IV, VI.A, and  VI.B.2) occupy  the  largest  portion of errors  (62% of 76 inspected 
errors).  The errors  dominated by F7 and F10 are further discussed as follows.
   Among the  ten  errors  dominated by F7, except  for three  (in which  one  is due  to 
a spurious anchor, and  two  are due  to abnormal transformations), all others  selected 
the sub-strings of their corresponding CNE references. Furthermore, each selected  sub- 
string  included the Chinese  bigrams that appear more frequently than  those within the 
remaining sub-string (of its reference CNE). In other  words, F7 tends  to select only the 
portion with  high  frequency bigrams when  all related components are  aligned. For
example, for  the  reference {(儿 童 拒 菸 运 动 中 心)::[National  Center  for  Tobacco-Free
Kids]}, only  {(中心)::[Center]} is extracted, as this Chinese  bigram is frequently used
in various organization names.  Further inspection of those  seven  cases (which  prefer
the sub-string) reveals  that  three  of them  are with  unmatched components (Category
IV); therefore only four of them  are, in fact, due to the problem of F7.
    On the other hand, among the nine errors  caused mainly by F10, only three of them 
chose the sub-strings of their corresponding ENE reference, and the remaining six errors 
selected  the strings unrelated to the reference due to spurious anchors and an acronym. 
It therefore seems that different languages possess  different error patterns.
    The problem of preferring a more frequent sub-string cannot be solved by normaliz- 
ing related bigrams. This is because  the current bigram model  does not consider the im- 
plied restriction on the context surrounding the given CNE. In other words, a given CNE 
also implies  that its left and right adjacent  characters should not be a part of CNE (or its 
left and right adjacent  characters must  be in a non-NE  region). In our data set, two adja- 
cent non-NE Chinese characters (or words for English) are found to be sufﬁcient for both 
left and right contexts. Therefore, the following additional terms are further proposed to
take care of this issue: P(cc−1 |cc0 , T) × P(cc0 |cc1 , T) × P(ccL+2 |ccL+1 , T) × P(ccL+1 |ccL , T),
where ccL  is the given  CNE, cc0  and  ccL+1  are its left and  right  adjacent  non-NE  char- 
acters,  respectively. This formula can be easily  derived from  P(C|Cb, Tc, T, Sc), similar
to Equation (8). The  derivation also  applies to English.  To test  this  supposition, the 
related experiment (Exp4 [MERT-W, N+Full Model] speciﬁed in Table 3) is updated as 
Experiment 5 with the probability features shown here.
Exp5:  This  experiment  (named  MERT-W, N-Full Model+Contextual-Bigram,  and

denoted by MERT-W-CB) replaces  [flL

The same is done for English.
    Table 15 shows  the performance on the test set (data  from  Exp4 are also listed  for 
comparison). The entries  in bold  indicate statistically signiﬁcant improvements over

their counterparts. Results  show  that the performance has indeed improved, and six of 
the  targeted seven  cases  (four  CNE  and  three  ENE errors,  as mentioned previously) 
have  been  corrected (the  remaining error  is  due  to  data  sparseness and  cannot   be
corrected). According to coefﬁcient  weighting by MERT process,  P(cc0 |cc1 , T) is more 
important than  P(cc−1 |cc0 , T), indicating that  the  closer  a non-NE  character is to the
given  NE, the more  inﬂuential it is. This observation conﬁrms our  intuition about  the
context effect. A similar  trend is also observed for other  contextual non-NE  characters.


5.2 NE Type Errors

In addition to the  111 boundary errors  just  analyzed, there  are  also  NE type  errors. 
Among those  635 NE pairs  with  correct  boundaries in the test set, there  are 41 (6.5%) 
NE type  errors  in Exp4 (MERT-W). Among them,  175 PER, 248 LOC, and  212 ORG 
NE types  are assigned. The associated confusion matrix  of various NE types  is shown 
in Table 16 (the numbers within the parentheses are the relative  ratios  of their  output 
types). All except 5 of the 41 NE type errors  originated from transliterated NE pairs (not 
shown in the table). This is consistent with our observation that even a human annotator 
ﬁnds it challenging to identify correct types for transliterated NE pairs in the absence  of 
context.
    Table  16 shows  that  PER has  the  highest error  rate,  LOC follows  as the  second, 
and ORG is a distant third.  In addition, PER and LOC are the types  that are most often 
confused with one another. These observations match the distribution of transliterations 
in each type  (the transliteration mode  ratios  for PER, LOC, and  ORG are 100%, 71.4%, 
and  25.2%, respectively), as it is very difﬁcult to determine the type  when  a NE is 
transliterated without context.
    To solve  NE type  errors  originating from  transliteration, the  adjacent  contextual 
non-NE  characters are  also  helpful. For  example, {(梅 尔 斯)::[Myers]} is incorrectly 
identiﬁed as LOC, when  in fact it should have  been  PER in the context  “主席梅尔斯”
(president Myers). The left adjacent contextual bigrams “主席” (president) should indicate
that  the following NE is likely to be PER. Table 15 shows  that  an additional four  type
errors  are also corrected apart  from  the six boundary errors.  Therefore, in comparison 
with the original MERT-W, this new version (MERT-W-CB) gains more in type-sensitive

F-score  (an  increase  of 1.5%, from  81.5% to  83.0%) than  in  type-insensitive F-score
(an increase  of 0.9%, from 87.1% to 88.0%).
    The adjacent contextual non-NE  characters have  only limited power in disam- 
biguating NE types,  however. For instance, the reference {(喀布尔)::[Kabul]} is incor- 
rectly  identiﬁed as PER, which  should be LOC in the  context  “在 喀 布 尔” (at Kabul).
Because “喀布尔” follows  a preposition “在” (at) in the associated context,  it indicates 
that  “喀 布 尔” is a location  name.  We can also easily  ﬁnd  counterexamples, however, 
such  as  “在 布希 周 围”  (around Bush), in  which  “布 希”  (Bush) is  PER, not  LOC.  In
fact, both  PER and  LOC can be freely  exchanged in this  situation in either  a Chinese 
or English  context.  Therefore, more  complicated syntactic or semantic information is 
required in some cases involving transliteration.
   Another interesting statistic not shown in Table 16 is the distribution of errors versus 
initial  NE types  (i.e., Tc and  Te) assigned in the ﬁrst  stage.  Among 41 errors,  22 (54%) 
have  both  incorrect Tc and  Te, 16 (39%) have  correct  Tc but  wrong Te, and  only 3 (7%) 
have correct Te but incorrect Tc. This distribution shows that Tc is more reliably assigned 
in the ﬁrst  stage  than  is Te, which  conﬁrms the observation in Ji and  Grishman (2006) 
that English NE type assignment is more challenging.

5.2.1 Features Contributing to Type Errors. Similarly,  the  study for #Worst  on weighted 
feature-scores is also performed under MERT-W-CB (i.e., Exp5). There are 37 type errors 
with  correct  boundaries, and  we have  examined that  F4 (NE Type  Re-assignment) is
the most  dominant feature in making these  errors.  Because  this  feature LogP(T|Tc, Te)
(Equation [7]) always assigns  an incorrect type when  both Tc and Te are incorrect (11 out
of 13 F4 errors  belong  to this  class),  it is not  surprising that  it is ranked at  the  top
(22 [59%] out of a total of 37 errors have both incorrect Tc and Te). In addition, the feature
LogP(δA |T) in Equation (6) always prefers PER (which  are always completely translit-
erated in the  corpus) when  all components in an  NE are  transliterated (i.e., δA  = 0).
Therefore, the feature is ranked second (31 out of 37 errors are complete transliterations,
although only 10 of them should have been assigned PER). It is found that all nine cases 
in this  category are  not  PER (only  two  of them  are not  transliterated), which  further 
supports our  analysis. Solving  these  type  errors  requires that  these  two  features be 
conditioned on more features, and requires further study. Finally, the top four features in 
making type errors are related to alignment (Equations [6] and [7]), which indicates that 
monolingual lexicon information (both  English  and  Chinese  bigrams) is more  reliable 
in deciding NE type.

6. Applications of the Proposed Model

It would be interesting to know  how the proposed model  performs in real applications. 
Because MERT-W performs best in our tests, it is adopted in this study on real applica- 
tions. Section 6.1 presents the effectiveness of improving NE recognition, and Section 6.2 
shows  how  the  improved NE recognition can be used  in learning a monolingual NE 
recognition model  (also NE translation table/models) in a semi-supervised manner.

6.1 On Improving  Monolingual NE Recognition

As explained in Section 2.1, the alignment result  can also be used  to reﬁne  the initially 
recognized NEs. The improvements that MERT-W made  in reﬁning the boundaries and 
NE types of those initially  recognized Chinese/English NEs are shown in Tables 17 and
18, respectively. For comparison, the rows associated with the initial recognizers and the

alignment baseline  systems are also given in the two tables (as before, the entries  in bold 
indicate that differences are statistically signiﬁcant). In addition, ﬁgures in parentheses 
indicate the corresponding differences in performance compared to the initial  version 
(shown in Table 2).
    Table 17 shows  that both the baseline  and  MERT-W systems have  signiﬁcantly im- 
proved the initial NE recognition type-insensitive results for both Chinese  and English. 
It also shows that MERT-W signiﬁcantly outperforms the baseline. In particular, Chinese 
ORG is observed to yield the largest improvement among NE types in both Chinese  and 
English, which matches our previous observations that the boundary of a Chinese  ORG 
is difﬁcult to identify using  only the information from the Chinese  sentence.
    The type-sensitive results are  given  in Table  18, which  shows  that  MERT-W also 
signiﬁcantly improves the initial  NE recognition results for both  Chinese  and  English.

Note  that  English  ORG yields  the  largest  gain  among NE types  in both  Chinese  and 
English,  again supporting our earlier  observation that an English  ORG cannot  be easily 
identiﬁed when only the English sentence is available. It must be noted  that the baseline 
alignment model  deteriorates the original NE recognition in overall  performance (even 
though it can correct  some NE initial boundary errors  as shown in Table 17), because  it 
does not use the features/constraints proposed in the joint model.

6.2 On Learning NE Recognition Models via Semi-Supervised Learning

In many  NLP  applications, the  associated process  will  be considerably  simpliﬁed  if 
the included NEs can be identiﬁed ﬁrst.  Therefore, it is important to have  a good  NE 
recognizer that  has been  well trained. Various  domains frequently have  different sets 
of NEs, however, and  new  NEs also emerge  over  time.  We thus  need  to periodically 
update the NE recognition model  (also the NE translation table/model, if it is for MT), 
which  necessitates the need  to ensure short  training times  (including set-up  time  and 
human effort). This requirement can be addressed well in a semi-supervised learning 
set-up  where parameters/tables are learned from a large unlabeled corpus with a small 
(albeit human) annotated seed set.
   Under the semi-supervised learning framework, however, maximizing likelihood 
does  not  imply  a minimizing of error  rate  at the  same  time.  Without additional con- 
straints, a monolingual NE model  is usually unable to converge to the desired point  in 
the  parameter space.  On the other  hand, as shown in the  previous section,  the align- 
ment  module can further reﬁne  the initially  recognized NEs with  additional mapping 
constraints from the other language. The proposed joint model  thus can be used to train 
the  monolingual NE recognition model  via  semi-supervised learning on  a large  un- 
labeled  bilingual corpus. In other  words, when  semi-supervised learning is conducted 
for learning the NE recognition model,  MERT-W is expected to guide  the search  pro- 
cess for convergence towards the human annotation. This advantage is important for 
regularly updating the NE recognition and translation table/models.
We now outline our semi-supervised learning procedure as follows.

(1)	A small pre-labeled corpus acts as seed data. Based on these seed data, 
train the Chinese/English NE recognition toolkit  (described in Section 4.1) 
and the adopted NE alignment model.

(2)	Perform the Chinese/English NE recognition toolkits  and the NE
alignment model,  trained in Step (1), on a large unlabeled
(sentence-aligned) bilingual corpus to report those NE pairs  that they 
identify.

(3)	Denote  the located  NE pairs  as correctly  labeled  and combine them  with 
the seed data as new labeled  training data.

(4)	Re-train  the Chinese/English NE recognition toolkit  and also re-train the
NE alignment model  on the newly  labeled  training data.

(5)	Repeat Steps (2) through (4) until convergence. The ﬁnal Chinese/English 
NE recognizer and the NE alignment model  are compared to their initial 
versions.

    Because  the  adopted Chinese  NE recognizer (Wu,  Zhao,  and  Xu 2005) cannot  be 
re-trained (because  it is not an open source toolkit), only the English NE recognizer and

the alignment model  are updated during training iterations. In our experiments, 50,412 
sentence pairs  are ﬁrst extracted from Training Set I as unlabeled data.  Various  labeled 
data sets are then extracted from the remaining data as seed corpora with different sizes 
(100, 400, 4,000, and  40,000 sentence pairs).  The test  set is still the  same  300 sentence 
pairs  that were adopted previously.
    Table 19 shows  the type-sensitive F-score of English  NER on the test set at conver- 
gence.19  The Initial-NER in Table 19 indicates the initial performance of the NER model 
re-trained from different seed corpora. Three different approaches are tested: (1) English 
NER  only  (NER-Only), (2) the  alignment baseline   model   (NER+Alignment-Baseline), 
and  (3) our  weighted joint model  MERT-W (NER+Alignment-Weighted). The ﬁrst  case 
performs semi-supervised learning only on English  data  without involving alignment, 
whereas the  last  two  cases  include alignment, and  both  the  English  NER model  and 
the  alignment model   are  re-trained during iterations. The  numbers in  parentheses 
show  relative  improvements over  Initial-NER. The entries  in bold  indicate statistically 
signiﬁcant improvements over Initial-NER.
    As Table 19 shows,  using  the NER model  alone,  the performance may  drop after 
convergence. This  is because  maximizing likelihood does  not  imply  minimizing the 
error  rate. With additional mapping constraints from the other  language, however, the 
alignment module can guide  the search process  to converge to a more desirable point in 
the parameter space. It must be noted here that the contribution of additional constraints 
increases with smaller  seed corpora, because  constraints become  more important when 
the labeled  data set is smaller.
    Table 20 shows  only the type-sensitive F-score of NE pair alignment on the test set 
before and after convergence due to space constraints. Two different models are tested: 
(1) the alignment baseline  model  (NER+Alignment-Baseline), and  (2) our weighted joint 
model  (NER+Alignment-Joint). The data  in parentheses indicate relative  improvements 
over the performance before training. The entries in bold indicate statistically signiﬁcant 
improvements over the model  before training.
    As Table 20 demonstrates, the alignment performance can also be improved with 
semi-supervised learning. Note  that  the improvement is greater on smaller  data  sets, 
which  is common in most semi-supervised learning tasks.


19 The iteration process  will stop when  the last two consecutive iterations share more than  99.9% of their 
output.

    As  shown by  Tables  19 and  20, the  proposed joint  model  gains  more  from  the 
learning process  in comparison with  the alignment-baseline model,  because  informa- 
tion  from  the  aligned sentence is utilized more  effectively.  Results  demonstrate that 
the proposed joint model,  combined with  semi-supervised learning, offers signiﬁcant 
improvement for semi-automatically updating the NE recognition model  and  the NE 
translation table.  Additionally, the  impact  is greater when  less  time  is available for 
labeling  seed data.


7. Related Work

There is signiﬁcant work on identifying NEs within monolingual texts across languages, 
such  as English  (Chinchor 1998; Mikheev, Grover,  and  Moens  1998; Borthwick 1999) 
and  Chinese  (Chen  et al. 1998a; Sun,  Zhou,  and  Gao  2003), to name  a few.  Various 
approaches to  identifying NEs  have  also  been  proposed, such  as  hidden Markov 
models (Bikel et al. 1997; Bikel, Schwartz, and  Weischedel 1999), conditional random 
ﬁelds   (McCallum  and   Li  2003;  Jiao  et  al.  2006),  modiﬁed  transformation-based 
learning (Black and  Vasilakopoulos 2002), boosting (Collins  2002; Wu et al. 2002), 
AdaBoost  (Carreras,  Marquez,  and   Padro  2002),  and   adopting  semi-supervised 
learning (Wong  and  Ng  2007; Liao and  Veeramachaneni 2009). Furthermore, features 
including local information (e.g., token,  part-of-speech) and  global  information  (e.g., 
label consistency, context  features) from monolingual resources have been adopted 
(Krishman and Manning 2006; Zhou  and Su 2006). In prior  work  on the use of bilingual 
NE alignment for NE recognition, Huang and  Vogel  (2004) used  an  iterative process 
to extract  a smaller  but cleaner  NE translation dictionary and  then  used  the dictionary 
to improve the  monolingual NE annotation quality. Ji and  Grishman (2007) adopted 
several  heuristic rules  for using  bilingual-text information to correct  NE recognition 
errors.
    In aligning bilingual NEs  from  two  given  NE  lists,  the  NE translation model  is 
usually adopted. Typically,  an NE is either transliterated or semantically translated. For 
transliteration, Knight  and  Graehl  (1998) were  pioneers in adopting the  probabilistic 
model  to align the components within an NE pair. Since then,  similar  approaches have 
been  applied to  various language pairs  such  as  English/Arabic (Stalls  and  Knight
1998), English/Chinese (Chen  et  al.  1998b; Wan  and  Verspoor 1998; Lin  and  Chen
2002; Lee and  Chang  2003; Lee, Chang,  and  Jang  2003; Gao,  Wong,  and  Lam  2004;





Pervouchine, Li, and Lin 2009), English/Japanese (Knight  and Graehl  1998; Tsuji 2002), 
and  English/Korean (Lee  and  Choi  1997; Oh  and  Choi  2002, 2005). Moreover, Li, 
Zhang, and  Su (2004), and  Li et al. (2007) presented a joint source  channel model  for 
transliteration, and  automated the semantic transliteration process,  which  takes origin 
and gender into account for personal names.
    In contrast, research on automatic NE semantic translation is less common. Zhang 
et al. (2005) proposed a phrase-based context-dependent joint  probability model  for 
semantic translation, which  is similar  to phrase-level translation models in statistical 
MT (Zong and Seligman 2005; Hu, Zong, and Xu 2006). Chen, Yang, and Lin (2003) and 
Chen  et al. (2006) studied formulation and  transformation rules  for English–Chinese 
NEs. They adopted a frequency-based approach for extracting key words of NEs with or 
without dictionary assistance and  constructed transformation rules  from  the bilingual 
NE  corpus. Their  studies focused on  transformation rules  with  particular attention 
to distinguishing translated parts  from  transliterated parts;  the  performance of rule- 
application in NE translation was not described, however. Chen  and  Zong  (2008) pro- 
posed a chunk-based probabilistic translation model  for organization names,  although, 
its application to person and location  names  has not been studied.
    Because new NEs emerge  from time to time and can be transformed in various ways 
(translation, transliteration, or other abnormal types), the NE transliteration/translation 
models mentioned usually lead  to  unsatisfactory results, especially for  infrequently 
occurring NEs. Recent studies have therefore focused on extracting new NE pairs  from 
either  bilingual corpora or Web resources, so that the corresponding human translation 
can be directly adopted (or used  for training). To do this, however, NE alignment is an 
essential tool. Due to the relatively poor quality of Web data, such alignment approaches 
are usually limited unless  signiﬁcant effort is devoted to data cleaning;  therefore, we do 
not discuss  these approaches.
    To extract  the  NE pairs  from  bilingual corpora, all NE alignment approaches we 
found in  the  literature are  conducted after  an  initial  NE  identiﬁcation stage  so that 
the complexity of the task can be reduced. The associated cost is that  those  initial  NE 
recognition errors propagate into the following alignment stage. Both symmetric (which 
ﬁrst identiﬁes NEs in both languages) and asymmetric (which ﬁrst identiﬁes NEs in only 
one language) strategies have been proposed to mitigate this problem (Moore 2003), and 
are described here.
    For the  symmetric strategy, Huang and  Vogel  (2004) proposed to extract  the  NE 
translation dictionary from  the  bilingual corpus, and  then  used   it  to  improve the 
NE  annotation performance iteratively. Huang, Vogel,  and  Waibel  (2003) described 
a multi-feature NE alignment model  to extract  NE equivalences (with  translation, 
transliteration, and tagging features), from which  a NE translation dictionary was then 
constructed. Kumano et al. (2004) proposed a method to extract  English–Chinese NE 
pairs  from  a content-aligned corpus. This approach tries  to ﬁnd  the  correspondences 
between bilingual NE groups based  on the  similarity in their  order  of appearance in 
each document. Additionally, an abridged version of our  work  has been  presented in 
our  ACL-10 paper (Chen,  Zong,  and  Su 2010). Among those  symmetric approaches, 
only Huang, Vogel, and  Waibel and  Chen, Zong,  and  Su adopt the expansion strategy, 
described below.
    For the asymmetric strategy, Al-Onaizan and Knight  (2002) proposed an algorithm 
to translate NEs  from  Arabic  to English  using  monolingual and  bilingual resources. 
Given an Arabic NE, they used  transliteration models (including a phonetic-based and 
a spelling-based model),  a bilingual dictionary, and  an  English  news  corpus to ﬁrst 
generate a list of English  candidates, which  were  then  re-scored by a Web  resource.





Moore  (2003) developed an  approach to learning phrase translations from  a parallel 
corpus based  on a sequence of cost models. A maximum entropy model  for NE align- 
ment was presented in Feng, Lv, and Zhou (2004). Lee, Chang, and Jang (2006) proposed 
to align  bilingual NEs in a bilingual corpus by incorporating a statistical model  with 
multiple sources.   Turning to  comparable corpora, Shao  and  Ng  (2004) presented a 
hybrid method to mine  new  translations from  Chinese–English comparable corpora, 
combining both  transliteration and  context  information. Sproat,  Tao, and  Zhai  (2006) 
investigated the  Chinese–English NE  transliteration equivalence within comparable 
corpora.
   Although these  asymmetry strategies can  prevent NE  recognition errors  on  the 
target  side  from  affecting  alignment, errors  on the  source  side  continue to propagate 
to later stages. To reduce error propagation from both the source and the target,  Huang, 
Vogel, and Waibel (2003) proposed to ﬁrst identify the NEs in both the source and target, 
and  then  enlarge the obtained NE candidate sets for both languages before conducting 
alignment. Based on the observation that  NE boundaries are frequently identiﬁed in- 
correctly,  the enlarging procedure is done  by treating the original recognition results as 
anchors and  then  increasing the number of candidates by expanding or shrinking the 
boundaries of those originally recognized NEs in both languages.
    Our approach also adopts the expansion strategy. It differs from the works of Huang 
et al. (2003) and  others  in several  ways,  however. First,  in all the  alignment papers 
mentioned here,  the  adopted probabilities are  directly used  as features for log-linear 
combination or ME training without derivation. In contrast, our  work  fully  derives a 
probabilistic joint  model,  for both  identiﬁcation and  alignment, in a principled way. 
Second,  unlike  previous approaches that  discard the information of initially  identiﬁed 
NE anchors after the anchors have been expanded, our approach uses this information 
in the ﬁnal selection  process.  Third, we propose new features, such as translation mode 
and its ratio, boundary shifting distance, and contextual bigrams. Fourth, we introduce 
a normalization step that removes the systematic bias preferring shorter NEs. Fifth, the 
effect of each individual feature, the inﬂuence of adopting different NE recognizers, the 
effectiveness across  different domains, the effect of using  a derived model  (compared 
to ME), and  the effect of the alignment model  in semi-supervised learning are studied. 
Finally,  the  causes  of alignment errors  and  type  re-assignment errors  are  extensively 
investigated and categorized.

8. Conclusion

This article develops a novel  and  principled model  for jointly conducting NE recogni- 
tion  and  alignment. To the best of our  knowledge, this is the ﬁrst  work  that  formally 
captures the interactions between NE recognition and  NE alignment. The joint model 
not only greatly improves NE alignment performance, but also signiﬁcantly boosts  NE 
recognition performance.
    Our  experiments show  that  the  new  NE likelihoods are  more  effective  than  the 
bigram model  used  in the baseline  system.  Moreover, both  the translation mode  ratio 
and  the  entity  type  consistency constraint  are  critical  in  identifying the  associated 
NE boundaries and  types,  as evidenced by the  21.3% relative  improvement on type- 
sensitive F-score (from 68.4% to 83.0%) in our Chinese–English NE alignment task. The 
superiority of the proposed model  has been  shown to hold  over  the various domains 
tested.
   Furthermore, the joint alignment model  can also be used  to reﬁne  the initially 
recognized NEs. This is achieved by utilizing additional mapping information from the





other  language. In our  experiments, when  semi-supervised learning is conducted to 
train  the adopted English  NE model  (with  only 100 seed sentence pairs),  the proposed 
model  greatly boosts  the English  NE recognition type-sensitive F-score from  36.7% to
47.4% (29.2% relative  improvement) in the test set.
    Finally,  the  proposed model   does  not  utilize  language-dependent  features. For 
example, Chinese  characters and  English  words adopted in the model  are visible units 
in the given languages, and no language-dependent features, such as morpheme/part- 
of-speech (or preﬁx/sufﬁx), are  used.  In addition, the  model  does  not  use  linguistic 
rules  or tree  banks.  Therefore, although our  experiments are  conducted on Chinese– 
English  language pairs,  it is expected that  the  proposed approach can  be applied to 
other language pairs  with little adaptation effort.
