Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2010), pages 617? 625, Beijing, August 2010 Revisiting Context-based Projection Methods for Term-Translation Spotting in Comparable Corpora Audrey Laroche OLST ? De? p. de linguistique et de traduction Universite? de Montre ? al audrey.laroche@umontreal.ca Philippe Langlais RALI ? DIRO Universite? de Montre ? al felipe@iro.umontreal.ca Abstract Context-based projection methods for identifying the translation of terms in comparable corpora has attracted a lot of attention in the community, e.g. (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999). Surprisingly, none of those works have systematically investi.gated the impact of the many parameters controlling their approach. The present study aims at doing just this. As a test.case, we address the task of translating terms of the medical domain by exploit.ing pages mined from Wikipedia. One in.teresting outcome of this study is that sig.nificant gains can be obtained by using an association measure that is rarely used in practice. 1 Introduction Identifying translations of terms in comparable corpora is a challenge that has attracted many re.searchers. A popular idea that emerged for solv.ing this problem is based on the assumption that the context of a term and its translation share sim .ilarities that can be used to rank translation candi.dates (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999). Many variants of this idea have been implemented. While a few studies have investigated pattern matching approaches to compare source and tar.get contexts (Fung, 1995; Diab and Finch, 2000; Yu and Tsujii, 2009), most variants make use of a bilingual lexicon in order to translate the words of the context of a term (often called seed words). De? jean et al (2005) instead use a bilingual the.saurus for translating these. Another distinction between approaches lies in the way the context is defined. The most com.mon practice, the so-called window-based ap .proach, defines the context words as those cooc.curing significantly with the source term within windows centered around the term.1 Some studies have reported gains by considering syntactically motivated co-occurrences. Yu and Tsujii (2009) propose a resource-intensive strategy which re.quires both source and target dependency parsers, while Otero (2007) investigates a lighter approach where a few hand coded regular expressions based on POS tags simulate source parsing. The latter approach only requires a POS tagger of the source and the target languages as well as a small par.allel corpus in order to project the source regular expressions. Naturally, studies differ in the way each co.occurrence (either window or syntax-based) is weighted, and a plethora of association scores have been investigated and compared, the like.lihood score (Dunning, 1993) being among the most popular. Also, different similarity measures have been proposed for ranking target context vec.tors, among which the popular cosine measure. The goal of the different authors who inves.tigate context-projection approaches also varies. Some studies are tackling the problem of iden.tifying the translation of general words (Rapp, 1999; Otero, 2007; Yu and Tsujii, 2009) while others are addressing the translation of domain specific terms. Among the latter, many are trans .lating single-word terms (Chiao and Zweigen.baum, 2002; De?jean et al, 2005; Prochasson et 1A stoplist is typically used in order to prevent function words from populating the context vectors. 617 al., 2009), while others are tackling the translation of multi-word terms (Daille and Morin, 2005). The type of discourse might as well be of con .cern in some of the studies dedicated to bilingual terminology mining. For instance, Morin et al (2007) distinguish popular science versus scien.tific terms, while Saralegi et al (2008) target pop.ular science terms only. The present discussion only focuses on a few number of representative studies. Still, it is al.ready striking that a direct comparison of them is difficult, if not impossible. Differences in re.sources being used (in quantities, in domains, etc.), in technical choices made (similarity mea.sures, context vector computation, etc.) and in ob.jectives (general versus terminological dictionary extraction) prevent one from establishing a clear landscape of the various approaches. Indeed, many studies provide some figures that help to appreciate the influence of some param.eters in a given experimental setting. Notably, Otero (2008) studies no less than 7 similarity mea.sures for ranking context vectors while comparing window and syntax-based methods. Morin et al (2007) consider both the log-likelihood and the mutual information association scores as well as the Jaccard and the cosine similarity measures. Ideally, a benchmark on which researchers could run their translation finder would ease the comparison of the different approaches. However, designing such a benchmark that would satisfy the evaluation purposes of all the researchers is far too ambitious a goal for this contribution. Instead, we investigate the impact of some major factors influ.encing projection-based approaches on a task of translating 5,000 terms of the medical domain (the most studied domain), making use of French and English Wikipedia pages extracted monolingually thanks to an information retrieval engine. While the present work does not investigate all the pa.rameters that could potentially impact results, we believe it constitutes the most complete and sys.tematic comparison made so far with variants of the context-based projection approach. In the remainder of this paper, we describe the projection-based approach to translation spotting in Section 2 and detail the parameters that directly influence its performance. The experimental pro.tocol we followed is described in Section 3 and we analyze our results in Section 4. We discuss the main results in the light of previous work and propose some future avenues in Section 5. 2 Projection-based variants The approach we investigate for identifying term translations in comparable corpora is similar to (Rapp, 1999) and many others. We describe in the following the different steps it encompasses and the parameters we are considering in the light of typical choices made in the literature. 2.1 Approach Step 1 A comparable corpus is constructed for each term to translate. In this study, the source and target corpora are sets of Wikipedia pages related to the source term (S) and its reference transla.tion (T ) respectively (see Section 3.1). The degree of corpus preprocessing varies greatly from one study to another. Complex linguistic tools such as terminological extractors (Daille and Morin, 2005), parsers (Yu and Tsujii, 2009) or lemma.tizers (Rapp, 1999) are sometimes used. In our case, the only preprocessing that takes place is the deletion of the Wikipedia symbols per.taining to its particular syntax (e.g. [[ ]]).2 It is to be noted that, for the sake of simplicity and gen .erality, our implementation does not exploit inter.language links nor structural elements specific to Wikipedia documents, as opposed to (Yu and Tsu.jii, 2009). Step 2 A context vector vs for the source term S is built (see Figure 1 for a made-up example). This vector contains the words that are in the con.text of the occurrences of S and are strongly cor.related to S. The definition of ?context? is one of the parameters whose best value we want to find. Context length can be based on a number of units, for instance 3 sentences (Daille and Morin, 2005), windows of 3 (Rapp, 1999) or 25 words (Prochas.son et al, 2009), etc. It is an important parame .ter of the projection-based approach. Should the context length be too small, we would miss words that would be relevant in finding the translation. On the other hand, if the context is too large, it 2We used a set of about 40 regular expressions to do this. 618 might contain too much noise. At this step, a sto.plist made of function words is applied in order to filter out context words and reduce noise in the context vector. Additionally, an association measure is used to score the strength of correlation between S and the words in its contexts; it serves to normalize corpus frequencies. Words that have a high as.sociation score with S are more prominent in the context vector. The association measure is the sec.ond important parameter we want to study. As al.ready noted, most authors use the log-likelihood ratio to measure the association between collo.cates; some, like (Rapp, 1999), informally com.pare the performance of a small number of associ.ation measures, or combine the results obtained with different association measures (Daille and Morin, 2005). Figure 1: Step 2 Step 3 Words in vs are projected into the target language with the help of the bilingual seed lexi.con (Figure 2). Each word in vs which is present in the bilingual lexicon is translated, and those translations define the projected context vector vp. Words that are not found in the bilingual lexicon are simply ignored. The size of the seed lexi.con and its content are therefore two important parameters of the approach. In previous studies, seed lexicons vary between 16,000 (Rapp, 1999) and 65,000 (De?jean et al, 2005) entries, a typical size being around 20,000 (Fung, 1998; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Daille and Morin, 2005). Figure 2: Step 3 Step 4 Context vectors vt are computed for each candidate term in the target language corpus (Fig.ure 3). The dimension of the target-vector space is defined to be the one induced by the projec.tion mechanism described in Step 3. The con .text vector vt of each candidate term is computed as in Step 2. Therefore, in Step 4, the parame .ters of context definition and association measure are important and take the same values as those in Step 2. Note that in this study, on top of all single terms, we also consider target bigrams as potential candidates (99.5 % of our reference tar.get terms are composed of at most two words). As such, our method can handle complex terms (of up to two words), as opposed to most previ.ous studies, without having to resort to a separate terminological extraction as in (Daille and Morin, 2005). Figure 3: Step 4 Step 5 Context vectors vt are ranked in decreas.ing order of their similarity with vp (Figure 4). The similarity measure between context vectors varies among studies: city-block measure (Rapp, 1999), cosine (Fung, 1998; Chiao and Zweigen.baum, 2002; Daille and Morin, 2005; Prochasson et al, 2009), Dice or Jaccard indexes (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Daille and Morin, 2005), etc. It is among the parameters whose effect we experimentally evaluate. Figure 4: Step 5 2.2 Parameters studied The five steps we described involve many param.eters, the values of which can influence at varying degrees the performance of a translation spotter. In the current study, we considered the following parameter values. Context We considered contexts defined as the current sentence or the current paragraph involv.619 ing S. We also considered windows of 5 and 25 words on both sides of S. Association measure Following the aforemen.tioned studies, we implemented these popular measures: pointwise mutual information (PMI), log-likelihood ratio (LL) and chi-square (? 2). We also implemented the discounted log-odds (LO) described by (Evert, 2005, p. 86) in his work on collocation mining. To our knowledge, this asso.ciation measure has not been used yet in transla.tion spotting. It is computed as: odds-ratiodisc = log (O11 + 2)(O22 + 12) (O12 + 12)(O21 + 12) where Oij are the cells of the 2? 2 contingency matrix of a word token s cooccurring with the term S within a given window size.3 Similarity measure We implemented four mea.sures: city-block, cosine, as well as Dice and Jac.card indexes (Jurafsky and Martin, 2008, p. 666). Our implementations of Dice and Jaccard are identical to the DiceMin and JaccardMin similar.ity measures reported in (Otero, 2008) and which outperformed the other five metrics he tested. Seed lexicon We investigated the impact of both the size of the lexicon and its content. We started our study with a mixed lexicon of around 5,000 word entries: roughly 2,000 of them belong to the medical domain, while the other entries be .long to the general language. We also considered mixed lexicons of 7,000, 9,000 and 11,000 entries (where 2,000 entries are related to the medical do.main), as well as a 5,000-entry general language only lexicon. 2.3 Cognate heuristic Many authors are embedding heuristics in order to improve their approach. For instance, Chiao and Zweigenbaum (2002) propose to integrate a reverse translation spotting strategy in order to im.prove precision. Prochasson et al (2009) boost the strength of context words that happen to be transliterated in the other language. A somehow 3For instance, O21 stands for the number of windows containing S but not s. generalized version of this heuristic has been de .scribed in (Shao and Ng, 2004). In this work, we examine the performance of the best configuration of parameters we found, combined with a simple heuristic based on graphic similarity between source and tar.get terms, similar to the orthographic features in (Haghighi et al, 2008)? s generative model. This is very specific to our task where medical terms often (but not always) share Latin or Greek roots, such as microvillosite? s in French and microvilli in English. In this heuristic, translation candidates which are cognates of the source term are ranked first among the list of translation candidates. In our implementation, two words are cognates if their first four characters are identical (Simard et al, 1992). One interesting note concerns the word.order mismatch typically observed in French and English complex terms, such as in ADN mitochon.drial (French) and mitochondrial DNA (English). We do treat this case adequately. 3 Experimental protocol In order to pinpoint the best configuration of val.ues for the parameters identified in Section 2.2, four series of experiments were carried out. In all of them, the task consists of spotting transla.tion candidates for each source language term us.ing the resources4 described below. The quality of the results is evaluated with the help of the metrics described in Section 3.2. 3.1 Resources Corpora The comparable corpora are made of the (at most) 50 French and English Wikipedia documents that are the most relevant to the source term and to its reference translation respectively. These documents are retrieved with the NLGbAse Information Retrieval tool.5 The average token count of all the 50-document corpora as well as the average frequency of the source and target terms in these corpora for our four series of ex .periments are listed in Table 1. 4Our resources are available at http://olst.ling. umontreal.ca/?audrey/coling2010/. They wereacquired as described in (Rubino, 2009). 5http://nlgbase.org/ 620 Experiment 1 2 3 4 Tokenss 89,431 73,809 42,762 90,328 Tokenst 52,002 27,517 12,891 38,929 |S| 296 184 66 306 |T | 542 255 104 404 Table 1: 50-document corpora averages The corpora are somewhat small (most corpora in previous studies are made of at least a million words). We believe this is more representative of a task where we try to translate domain specific terms. Some of the Wikipedia documents may contain a handful of parallel sentences (Smith et al., 2010), but this information is not used in our approach. The construction of the corpus involves a bias in that the reference translations are used to obtain the most relevant target language docu.ments. However, since our objective is to com.pare the relative performance of different sets of parameters, this does not affect our results. In fact, as per (De? jean et al, 2005) (whose compa.rable corpora are English and German abstracts), the use of such an ? ideal ? corpus is common (as in (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002), where the cor.pus is built from a specific query). Seed lexicon The mixed seed lexicon we use is taken from the Heymans Institute of Pharmacol.ogy?s Multilingual glossary of technical and pop.ular medical terms.6 Random general language entries from the FreeLang7 project are also in.corporated into the lexicon for some of our exper.iments. Reference translations The test set is com.posed of 5,000 nominal single and multi-word pairs of French and English terms from the MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) thesaurus.8 3.2 Evaluation metrics The performance of each set of parameters in the experiments is evaluated with Top N precision (PN ), recall (RN ) and F-measure (FN ), as well as Mean Average Precision (MAP). Precision is 6http://users.ugent.be/? rvdstich/ eugloss/welcome.html 7http://www.freelang.net/ 8http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/ the number of correct translations (at most 1 per source term) divided by the number of terms for which our system gave at least one answer; recall is equal to the ratio of correct translations to the total number of terms. F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall: F-measure = 2? (precision? recall)(precision+ recall) The MAP represents in a single figure the qual.ity of a system according to various recall levels (Manning et al, 2008, p. 147?148): MAP(Q) = 1|Q| j=1? |Q| 1 mj k=1 ? mj Precision(Rjk) where |Q| is the number of terms to be trans.lated, mj is the number of reference translations for the jth term (always 1 in our case), and Precision(Rjk) is 0 if the reference translation is not found for the jth term or 1/r if it is (r is the rank of the reference translation in the translation candidates). 4 Experiments In Experiment 1, 500 single and multi-word terms must be translated from French to English using each of the 64 possible configurations of these pa.rameters: context definition, association measure and similarity measure. In Experiment 2, we sub.mit to the 8 best variants 1,500 new terms to de.termine with greater confidence the best 2, which are again tested on the last 3,000 of the test terms (Experiment 3). In Experiment 4, using 1,350 fre.quent terms, we examine the effects of seed lex.icon size and specificity and we apply a heuristic based on cognates. 4.1 Experiment 1 The results of the first series of experiments on 500 terms can be analysed from the point of view of each of the parameters whose values varied among 64 configurations (Section 2.2). The max.imal MAP reached for each parametric value is given in Table 2. The most notable result is that, of the four as.sociation measures studied, the log-odds ratio is 621 Param.

There is as much as 34 % difference be.tween LO and other measures for Top 1 recall. This is interesting since most previous works use the log-likelihood, and none use LO. Our best re.sults for LO (with cosine sentence) and LL (with Dice sentence) are in Table 3. Note that the oracle recall is 93 % (7 % of the source and target terms were not in the corpus). Assoc. R1 R20 P1 P20 F1 F20 MAP LO 39.4 84.8 42.3 91.0 40.8 87.8 0.536 LL 29.0 75.2 31.3 81.0 30.1 78.0 0.413 Table 3: Best LO and LL configurations scores Another relevant observation is that the param.eters interact with each other. When the similar.ity measure is cosine, PMI results in higher Top 1 F-scores than LL, but the Top 20 F-scores are bet.ter with LL. PMI is better than LL when using city-block as a similarity measure, but LL is better than PMI when using Dice and Jaccard indexes. ?2 gives off the worst MAP in all but 4 of the 64 parametric configurations. As for similarity measures, the Dice and Jac.card indexes have identical performances, in ac.cordance with the fact that they are equivalent (Otero, 2008).9 Influences among parameters are also observable in the performance of similarity measures. When the association measure is LO, the cosine measure gives slightly better Top 1 F.9For this reason, whenever ?Dice? is mentioned from this point on, it also applies to the Jaccard index. scores, while the Dice index performs slightly bet.ter with regards to Top 20 F-scores. Dice is better when the association measure is LL, with a Top 1 F-score gain of about 15 % compared to the co .sine. Again, in the case of context definitions, rel.ative performances depend on the other param.eters and on the number of top translation can.didates considered. With LO, sentence contexts have the highest Top 1 F-measures, while Top 20 F-measures are highest with paragraphs, and 5.word contexts are the worst. 4.2 Experiment 2 The best parametric values found in Experiment 1 were put to the test on 1,500 different test terms for scale-up verification. Along with LO, which was the best association measure in the previous experiment, we used LL to double-check its rel.ative inefficiency. For all of the 8 configurations evaluated, LL? s recall, precision and MAP remain worse than LO? s. In particular, LO? s MAP scores with the cosine measure are more than twice as high as LL? s (respectively 0.33 and 0.124 for sen.tence contexts). As in Experiment 1, the Dice index is significantly better for LL compared to the cosine, but not for LO. In the case of LO, sentence contexts have better Top 1 performances than paragraphs, and vice versa for Top 20 per.formances (see Table 4; oracle recall is 93.5 %). Hence, paragraph contexts would be more useful in tasks consisting of proposing candidate transla.tions to lexicographers, while sentences would be more appropriate for automatic bilingual lexicon construction.

Moreover, we observe the effect of source and target term frequencies in corpus. As seen in Table 1, these frequencies are on average about half smaller in Experiment 2 as they are in Experiment 1, which results in significantly lower performances for all 622 8 variants. As Figure 5 shows for the variant LO cosine sentence, terms that are more frequent have a greater chance of being correctly translated at better ranks. Figure 5: Average rank of correct translation according to average source term frequency However, the relative performance of the differ.ent parametric configurations still holds. 4.3 Experiment 3 In Experiment 3, we evaluate the two best config.urations from Experiment 2 with 3,000 new terms in order to verify the relative performance of the cosine and Dice similarity measures. As Table 5 shows, cosine has slightly better Top 1 figures, while Dice is a little better when considering the Top 20 translation candidates. Therefore, as pre.viously mentioned, the choice of similarity mea.sure (cosine or Dice) should depend on the goal of translation spotting. Note that the scores in Ex.periment 3 are much lower than those of Experi.ments 1 and 2 because of low term frequencies in the corpus (see Table 1 and Figure 5). Also, oracle recall is only 71.1 %.

We tested the different lexicons (see Section 2.2) on the 4 parametric configurations made of sentence contexts, LO or LL association measures, and cosine or Dice similarity measures. Yet again, LO is better than LL. MAP scores for LO in all variants are comprised in [0.466?0.489]; LL MAPs vary between 0.135 and 0.146 when the cosine is used and between 0.348 and 0.380 when the Dice index is used. According to our results, translation spotting is more accurate when the seed lexicon contains (5,000) entries from both the medical domain and general language instead of general language words only, but only by a very small margin. Table 6 shows the results for the configuration LO cosine sentence. The fact that the difference Lex.

The reference translations from MeSH contain terms that are also used in other domains or in the general language, e.g. terms from the category ?people? (Ne? ve ? ol and Ozdowska, 2006). Wikipedia documents retrieved by using those ref.erences may in turn not belong to the medical do.main, in which case medical terms from the seed lexicon are not appropriate. Still, the relatively good performance of the general language-only lexicon supports (De? jean et al, 2005, p. 119)?s claim that general language words are useful when spotting translations of domain specific terms, since the latter can appear in generic contexts. Lexicon sizes tested are 5,000 (the mixed lex.icon used in previous experiments), 7,000, 9,000 and 11,000 entries. The performance (based on MAP) is better when 7,000- and 9,000-entry lexi.cons are used, because more source language con.text words can be taken into account. However, when the lexicon reaches 11,000, Top 1 MAP scores and F-measures are slightly lower than those obtained with the 7,000-entry one. This may happen because the lexicon is increased with gen .eral language words; 9,000 of the 11,000 entries 623 are not from the medical domain, making it harder for the context words to be specific. It would be interesting to study the specificity of context vec.tors built from the source corpus. Still, the dif.ferences in scores are small, as Table 7 shows (see Table 6 for the results obtained with 5,000 entries). This is because, in our implementation, context vector size is limited to 20, as in (Daille and Morin, 2005), in order to reduce processing time. The influence of context vector sizes should be studied. Lex. size R1 R20 P1 P20 F1 F20 MAP 7,000 41.5 88.8 41.6 89.1 41.5 88.9 0.488 9,000 40.9 89.3 41.1 89.7 41.0 89.5 0.489 11,000 40.1 89.8 40.2 90.1 40.1 89.9 0.484 Table 7: LO cosine sentence configuration scores The parameters related to the seed lexicon do not have as great an impact on the performance as the choice of association measure does: the biggest difference in F-measures for Experiment 4 is 2.9 %. At this point, linguistic-based heuris.tics such as graphic similarity should be used to significantly increase performance. We ap .plied the cognate heuristic (Section 2.3) on the Top 20 translation candidates given by the vari.ant LO sentence 9,000-entry lexicon using cosine and Dice similarity measures. Without the heuris .tic, Top 1 performances are better with cosine, while Dice is better for Top 20. Applying the cog.nate heuristic makes the Top 1 precision go from 41.1 % to 55.2 % in the case of cosine, and from 39.6 % to 53.9 % in the case of Dice. 5 Discussion Our results show that using the log-odds ratio as the association measure allows for significantly better translation spotting than the log-likelihood. A closer look at the translation candidates ob.tained when using LL, the most popular asso.ciation measure in projection-based approaches, shows that they are often collocates of the refer.ence translation. Therefore, LL may fare better in an indirect approach, like the one in (Daille and Morin, 2005). Moreover, we have seen that the cosine simi.larity measure and sentence contexts give more correct top translation candidates, at least when LO is used. Indeed, the values of the different parameters influence one another in most cases. Parameters related to the seed lexicon (size, do.main specificity) are not of great influence on the performance, but this may in part be due to our resources and the way they were built. The highest Top 1 precision, 55.2 %, was reached with the following parameters: sentence contexts, LO, cosine and a 9,000-entry mixed lex.icon, with the use of a cognate heuristic. In future works, other parameters which in.fluence the performance will be studied, among which the use of a terminological extractor to treat complex terms (Daille and Morin, 2005), more contextual window configurations, and the use of syntactic information in combination with lexical information (Yu and Tsujii, 2009). It would also be interesting to compare the projection-based approaches to (Haghighi et al, 2008)?s genera.tive model for bilingual lexicon acquisition from monolingual corpora. One latent outcome of this work is that Wikipedia is surprisingly suitable for mining med.ical terms. We plan to check its adequacy for other domains and verify that LO remains a bet.ter association measure for different corpora and domains.
