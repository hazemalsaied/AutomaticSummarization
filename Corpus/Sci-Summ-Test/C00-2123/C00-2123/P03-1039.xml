			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">The framework of statistical machine translation formulates the problem of translating a source sentence in a language J into a target language E as the maximization problem of the conditional probability Eˆ = argmaxE P(E|J).</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">The application of the BayesRule resulted in Eˆ = argmaxE P(E)P(J|E).</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">The for mer term P(E) is called a language model, representing the likelihood of E. The latter term P(J|E) is called a translation model, representing the generation probability from E into J.As an implementation of P(J|E), the word align ment based statistical translation (Brown et al., 1993) has been successfully applied to similar language pairs, such as French–English and German– English, but not to drastically diﬀerent ones, such as Japanese–English.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">This failure has been due to the limited representation by word alignment and the weak model structure for handling complicated word correspondence.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">This paper provides a chunk-based statistical translation as an alternative to the word alignment based statistical translation.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">The translation process inside the translation model is structured as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">A source sentence is first chunked, and then each chunk is translated into target language with local word alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Next, translated chunks are reordered to match the target language constraints.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Based on this scenario, the chunk-based statistical translation model is structured with several components and trained by a variation of the EM- algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">A translation experiment was carried out with a decoder based on the left-to-right beam search.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">It was observed that the translation quality improved from 46.5% to 52.1% in BLEU score and from 59.2% to 65.1% in subjective evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">The next section briefly reviews the word alignment based statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Section 3 discusses an alternative approach, a chunk-based translation model, ranging from its structure to training procedure and decoding algorithm.</S>

			<S sid ="46" ssid = "8">Similarly, inserted words are selected by the Lexical Model parameter and inserted at the positions determined by a binomial distribution.</S>

			<S sid ="57" ssid = "19">The number of chunks for source and target is assumed to be equal, |J| = |E|, so that each chunk can convey a unit of meaning without added/subtracted information.</S>

			<S sid ="101" ssid = "10">The parameter estimation for the chunk-based trans P(J|E) = E,J,A,A i E(ϕi |Ei) lation model relies on the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).</S>

			<S sid ="109" ssid = "18">The details of the procedure are described in Appendix A. In addition to the computational problem, there exists a local-maximum problem, where the EM- Algorithm converges to a maximum solution but does not guarantee finding the global maximum.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "19">In order to solve this problem and to make the parameters converge quickly, IBM Model 4 parameters were used as the initial parameters for training.</S>

			<S sid ="145" ssid = "54">The chunk-based translation model was originally inspired by transfer-based machine translation but modeled by chunks in order to capture syntax-based correspondence.</S>
			<S sid ="146" ssid = "55">However, the structures evolved into complicated modeling: The translation model involves many stages, notably chunking and two kinds of reordering, word-based and chunk-based alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="147" ssid = "56">This is directly reflected in parameter Figure 6: Translation examples by word alignment based model and chunk-based model estimation, where chunk3 took 20 days for 40 iterations, which is roughly the same amount of time required for training IBM Model 5 with pegging.</S>
			<S sid ="148" ssid = "57">The unit of chunk in the statistical machine translation framework has been extensively discussed in the literature.</S>
			<S sid ="149" ssid = "58">Och et al.</S>
			<S sid ="150" ssid = "59">(1999) proposed a translation template approach that computes phrasal mappings from the viterbi alignments of a training corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="151" ssid = "60">Watanabe et al.</S>
			<S sid ="152" ssid = "61">(2002) used syntax-based phrase alignment to obtain chunks.</S>
			<S sid ="153" ssid = "62">Marcu and Wong (2002) argued for a different phrase-based translation modeling that directly induces a phrase-by-phrase lexicon model from word-wise data.</S>
			<S sid ="154" ssid = "63">All of these methods biasthe training and/or decoding with phrase-level ex amples obtained by preprocessing a corpus (Och et al., 1999; Watanabe et al., 2002) or by allowing a lexicon model to hold phrases (Marcu and Wong, 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="155" ssid = "64">On the other hand, the chunk-based translation model holds the knowledge of how to construct a sequence of chunks from a sequence of words.</S>
			<S sid ="156" ssid = "65">The former approach is suitable for inputs with less de viation from a training corpus, while the latter approach will be able to perform well on unseen word sequences, although chunk-based examples are also useful for decoding to overcome the limited context of a n-gram based language model.</S>
			<S sid ="157" ssid = "66">Wang (1998) presented a diﬀerent chunk-basedmethod by treating the translation model as a phrase to-string process.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "67">Yamada and Knight (2001) further extended the model to a syntax-to-string translation modeling.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "68">Both assume that the source part of a translation model is structured either with a sequence of chunks or with a parse tree, while our method directly models a string-to-string procedure.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "69">It is clear that the string-to-string modeling with hi- den chunk-layers is computationally more expensive than those structure-to-string models.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "70">However, the structure-to-string approaches are already biased by a monolingual chunking or parsing, which, in turn, might not be able to uncover the bilingual phrasal or syntactical constraints often observed in a corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "71">Alshawi et al.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "72">(2000) also presented a two-level arranged word ordering and chunk ordering by a hierarchically organized collection of finite state trans ducers.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "73">The main diﬀerence from our work is that their approach is basically deterministic, while the chunk-based translation model is non-deterministic.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "74">The former method, of course, performs more efficient decoding but requires stronger heuristics to generate a set of transducers.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "75">Although the latter approach demands a large amount of decoding time and hypothesis space, it can operate on a very broad- coverage corpus with appropriate translation modeling.</S>
