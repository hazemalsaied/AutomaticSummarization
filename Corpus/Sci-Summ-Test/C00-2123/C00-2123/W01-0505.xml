			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Thus, a lot of approaches have been sug gested to find sets of corresponding word tokens (Brown et al., 1993; Berger et al., 1996; Melamed,1997), phrase (Shin et al., 1996), noun phrase (Ku piec, 1993), and collocation (Smadja et al., 1996) in a bitext.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Some works have used lexical association measures for finding word correspondences (Gale and Church,1991; Fung and Church, 1994).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">However, the associ ation measures can be misled in cases where a word in a source language frequently co-occurs with more than one word in a target language or in cases of indirect association&amp;apos; (Melamed, 1997).</S>

			<S sid ="28" ssid = "5">in Korean and English bitext Although one-to-one correspondence assumption has been shown to give highly accurate results in closely related language pair (Melamed, 1997), it does notfit in structurally different language pair such as Ko rean and English.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "6">According to Shin et al.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "7">(1996), the coverage of one-to-one correspondence in Koreanand English bitext is approximately 34% and many to-many mappings exceed 40% in lexical alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "8">Besides, Korean and English show much difference in terms of unit of mutual translation as shown in Table 1.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "9">Thus, we use structural or linguistic informationto find accurate lexical alignments of bitext.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "10">In gen eral, structural information can be represented bythe form of bilingual correspondence of phrase structure (Watanabe et al., 2000) or dependency struc ture (Yamamoto, 2000).</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "11">To find these structural correspondences betweena language pair, unification-based grammar (Mat sumoto, 1993) or bilingual grammar (Wu, 1997) can be used.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "12">That is, if we try to find structural match of bitext, syntactic analysis of each text should be donefirst.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "13">However, syntactic analysis of each text(or bi text) is also a hard and computationally complicated problem.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "14">In this paper, we propose POS sequence feature.We consider correspondences between POS tag se quences of bitext as the structural information whichis important in determining structures and reduc ing unnecessary parameters of a statistical alignment model.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "15">We induce the correspondences(structural features) by a feature selection method based on the ME framework.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "16">Finally, the structural features are embedded in a lexical alignment model of English and Korean bitext.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "17">Our model offers the following advantages: 1.</S>

			<S sid ="44" ssid = "21">The model can take advantage of the explicit.</S>

			<S sid ="46" ssid = "23">Therefore, it can reduce a lot of parameters in statistical machine translation by elim inating syntactically unlikely alignments.</S>

			<S sid ="52" ssid = "2">3 Overview of the model.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "3">In general, there exist constaints among POS se quences mapping when aligning bitext.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "4">For instance, in many cases a noun in Korean is translated to a noun or a noun preceded by an article in English.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "5">This POS constraint would be useful information in alignment of a closely related pair as well as a less closely related language pair.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "6">Some approaches design an alignment algorithm that maximizes the number of matching POS in aligned segments (Papageorgiou et al., 1994).</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "7">We also assume that the mapping information of POS sequences of a language pair is useful in a model of statistical machine translation.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "8">If there are similarities between corresponding POS sequences in bitext, the structural feature would be easily computed or identified.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "9">However,a POS sequence in English often correspond to a to tally different POS sequence in Korean as shown in the following example: can/MD eui/ENTR1 sa/NNDE1 &amp;apos;iss/AJMA da/ENTEIt is caused by the discrepancy between two lan guages.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "10">Korean is an agglutinative language.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "11">A sentence in Korean consists of a series of syntactic units called eojeol.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "12">An eojeol delimited by whitespace is often composed of a content word and function words.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "13">Tense markers, clausal connectives, particles and so forth are contained in an eojeol.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "14">Thus, one or more words in English often correspond to an eojeol, i.e. a couple of morphemes.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "15">For instance, a phrase, &amp;apos;tothe school&amp;apos;, in English corresponds to an eojeol &amp;amp;quot;d4 2___(haggyoro, school-to)&amp;apos; in Korean.Thus, we need a method for mapping POS se quences of bitext.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "16">In this paper, the correspondencesof POS tag sequences are obtained by automatic fea ture selection based on the ME framework.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "17">Here, a feature is defined as a correspondence of POS tag sequences in bitext.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "18">The outline of finding correspondences of POS tag sequences is as follows: First, our model starts with initial features obtained by a supervision step.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "19">The initial features are extracted from a small portion of bitext, which of weights are trained by the IIS algorithm (Berger et al., 1996; Pietra et al., 1997).</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "20">These are called initial active features.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "21">In the next step, a feature pool is constructed from training data.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "22">At this time, only features giving alarge gain to the model are selected.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "23">The final out put of feature selection is the set of active features and the correspondences of POS tag sequences that are represented with conditional probabilities.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "24">The resulted features are used for the parameters of bilingual text alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "25">In the process, we look at the words to ensure a correct alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "26">That is, the POS sequences are in fact encoding particular words.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "27">The underlying process is as follows: Input: a set L of POS-labeled sentence pairs.</S>

			<S sid ="93" ssid = "2">As mentioned above, features which represent mappings of POS sequences in two languages are auto matically learned from bitext.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "3">The learning consistsof two steps: (1) supervised step and (2) unsuper vised feature selection.In the supervised step, we manually aligned En glish and Korean texts.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "4">From the manually aligned text, we consturct a feature pool which has initial POS sequence correspondence.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "5">In the unsupervised feature selection, the POS sequence correspondeces are added to the feature pool.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "6">4.1 Supervision Step.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "7">In the supervision step, a small portion of bi text is tagged using Brill&amp;apos;s tagger (Brill, 1995) and `MORANY&amp;apos; (Yoon et.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "8">al., 1999), each of which is for English and Korean tagging respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "9">We manually aligned each sentence pair in the bitext and collected their correspondences of tag sequences.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "10">For simplicity, we adjusted some part of Brill&amp;apos;s tag set.First of all, we classified sentential patterns of En glish and Korean.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "11">Then, we aligned English and Korean sentence pairs on the basis of the patterns.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "12">Also, we made tag sequence construction rules with respect to each language by analysis of the caseswhere the words of one unit are separated and ad jacent.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "13">The rules are used when making a feature pool.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "14">After collecting the correspondences of POS tag sequences, we used them as a set of initial active features, A. 4.2 Construction of a Feature Pool.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "15">In this chapter, we describe how a feature pool isconstructed.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "16">Our task is to construct a probabil ity model p that produces a corresponding Korean tag sequence &amp;amp;quot;Tic for a given English tag sequenceJ.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "17">As features to represent the model, we use co occurrence information of POS tag sequences.Let Ts be all possible correspondences of tag se quences for a specific sentence pair, S. We then define a feature function (or a feature) as follows: 1 x = te &amp;amp; y = tk Sz fte,t,(x,y) = pair(te,tk) E TS 0 otherwiseA feature fte,t,, which indicates co-occurrence be tween tags appearing in Ts, expresses information for predicting that an English POS tag sequence te maps into a Korean POS tag sequence tk â€¢ In order to make a feature pool, given a sentence pair, we first construct all possible combinations ofEnglish POS tag sequences and Korean POS tag sequences.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "18">Among them, only features fte,t, that sat isfy the following two conditions are added into the feature pool P. â€¢ count(fte,t,)&amp;gt; 15 â€¢ there exist tk such that (te, tk.)</S>

			<S sid ="111" ssid = "20">Since the set of P is too vast, a feature selection pro cess is needed to select useful features.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "21">For this, eachfeature is evaluated according to how much they con tribute to the likelihood of training data, which is called gain.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "22">Before explaining feature gain and a process of feature selection, we will give a brief introduction ofME.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "23">In ME, a feature gives information to a proba bility model and it has a weight.Thus, the model is constrained by features we de fined.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "24">In general weights of the features are trained by the improved iterative scaling (IIS) algorithmthat minimizes the KullbackLeibler divergence be tween the model and the empirical distribution of the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "25">In fact, our model reduces to a simple type of probability model that can be derived simply from a ratio counts since the features do not overlap.</S>

The model p.,611 contains another param eter a, in addition to the parameters given by active features, which is a weight for the feature L. In order to make it tractable to compute feature selection, we assume that the addition of a feature L affects only the single parameter a. The only parameter which distinguishes models of (2) is a. 1 (2) pAf, = zct(x)PA(Yix)eaL(x&amp;apos;Y) Z(x) =EPA(Yix)ectMx&amp;apos;Y) The improvement (gain) of a model after adding asingle feature L can be estimated by measuring dif ference of maximum log-likelihood between L(pAL) and L(pA).</S>

			<S sid ="157" ssid = "66">In the training bitext, English 2149 words and Korean 3317 eojeols with low frequency 4 and English 712 words and Korean 486 eojeols with high frequency (50300) were found.For an evaluation, 100 words and 100 eojeols were selected out of them.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "67">The alignments of the words (eo jeols) were evaluated.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "68">As a result, it turns out that the structural features are effective in rare words.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "69">Effect of reducing a parameter spaceAnother advantage of the use of structural fea tures is to reduce parameter space of the lexical alignment model.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "70">To show the impacts on the size ofthe parameter space reduced by our model, we com pared the results from our model with those from the IBM 1-model presented by Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "71">(1993) on 100 sentence pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "72">The number of parametersobtained means the counts of possible lexical map pings.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "73">As shown in Table 8, the number of prameters were drastically reduced in our model.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "74">Considering the complexity of another models (IBM 25) it is obvious that they have more parameters.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "75">Effect of improving the results of lexical alignmentsFor evaluating the efficacy of the structural fea tures, we compared the results with IBM model 1.</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "76">Accuracy IBM 1 59.8 Our Model 73.7 Table 9: Accuracy of n:1 and 1:1 alignmentsAs described before, only n(English):1 and 1:1 mapping are possible in IBM model since one-to-one cor respondence is assumed.</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "77">Thus, we selected only n:1 and 1:1 alignments out of the alignment results.</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "78">For comparison, we investigated the alignments of the English 100 words with high frequency, which were explained above.</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "79">Table 9 shows the accuracy of lexical alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "80">It is shown that the structural features have an effect on the alignment even though the amount of data investigated is small.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "81">However, the overall accuracy of the alignment is somewhat low, which is mainly due to the small size of training samples.</S>
			<S sid ="173" ssid = "82">Table 10 shows some results ofmutual translation.</S>
			<S sid ="174" ssid = "83">We see a considerable improvement when allowing for structural features (correspondences of POS tag sequences) in lexical align ments.</S>
			<S sid ="175" ssid = "84">Error AnalysisExcept the errors by the incorrect parameter esti mation, most errors of correspondences of POS tagsequences are caused by POS tagging errors.</S>
			<S sid ="176" ssid = "85">In ad dition, the correspondences of adverbs turn out to be Korean English Probability jeongbu government 0.7312 jeongbu the government 0.2012 jeongbu republic 0.0328 jeongbu authorities 0.0171 jeongbu officials 0.0119 jeongbu Chinese 0.0041 Table 10: Examples of alignment sometimes erroneous, which is due to the fact that the position of adverb can be moved quite free.</S>
			<S sid ="177" ssid = "86">7 Conclusion.</S>
			<S sid ="178" ssid = "87">Because of the considerable difference between English and Korean, computation cost of lexical align ment is very high.</S>
			<S sid ="179" ssid = "88">One solution of the problem is to provide mapping information of syntactic structure between the two languages.</S>
			<S sid ="180" ssid = "89">In this paper, we defined the structural feature asthe correspondence of POS tag sequences and pre sented a method for extraction of structural features for KoreanEnglish bilingual alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "90">Firstly, the initial active features were collected from a small size of manually aligned bitext, which are trained by IIS which is a training algorithm for ME. Secondly, extracted from training data, the features giving a large gain were added to the set of active features.</S>
			<S sid ="182" ssid = "91">Furthermore, the features extracted were tested for lexical alignment of bitext.</S>
			<S sid ="183" ssid = "92">The experiment showed that the features are helpful for reducing the mapping space in alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="184" ssid = "93">We expect that the alignment can be more accurate and efficient by combining the structural features with translation lexicon in the future.</S>
