			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">The task of the search procedure is to find the most likely translation given a source sentence and a set of model parameters.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Here, we will use a trigram language model and the translation model presented in Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">(1993).</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Since the number of possible translations of a given source sentence is enormous, we must find the best output without actually generating the set of all possible translations; instead we would like to focus on the most likely translation hypotheses during the search process.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">For this purpose, we present a data-driven beam search algorithm similar to the one used in speech recognition search algorithms (Ney et al. 1992).</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">The major difference between the search problem in speech recognition and statistical MT is that MT must take into account the different word order for the source and the target language, which does not enter into speech recognition.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Tillmann, Vogel, Ney, and Zubiaga (1997) proposes a dynamic programming (DP)–based search algorithm for statistical MT that monotonically translates the input sentence from left to right.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">The word order difference is dealt with using a suitable preprocessing step.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Although the resulting search procedure is very fast, the preprocessing is language specific and requires a lot of manual ∗ IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598.</S>

			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Currently, most search algorithms for statistical MT proposed in the literature are based on the A∗ concept (Nilsson 1971).</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Here, the word reordering can be easily included in the search procedure, since the input sentence positions can be processed in any order.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">The work presented in Berger et al.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">(1996) that is based on the A∗ concept, however, introduces word reordering restrictions in order to reduce the overall search space.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">The search procedure presented in this article is based on a DP algorithm to solve the traveling-salesman problem (TSP).</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">A data-driven beam search approach is presented on the basis of this DP-based algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">The cities in the TSP correspond to source positions of the input sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">By imposing constraints on the possible word reorderings similar to that described in Berger et al.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">(1996), the DP-based approach becomes more effective: when the constraints are applied, the number of word re- orderings is greatly reduced.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">The original reordering constraint in Berger et al.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">(1996) is shown to be a special case of a more general restriction scheme in which the word reordering constraints are expressed in terms of simple combinatorical restrictions on the processed sets of source sentence positions.1 A set of four parameters is given to control the word reordering.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">Additionally, a set of four states is introduced to deal with grammatical reordering restrictions (e.g., for the translation direction German to English, the word order difference between the two languages is mainly due to the German verb group.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">In combination with the reordering restrictions, a data-driven beam search organization for the search procedure is proposed.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">A beam search pruning technique is conceived that jointly processes partial hypotheses according to two criteria: (1) The partial hypotheses cover the same set of source sentence positions,and (2) the partial hypotheses cover sets C of source sentence positions of equal car dinality.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">A partial hypothesis is said to cover a set of source sentence positions when exactly the positions in the set have already been processed in the search process.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">To verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, we report and analyze results for two translation tasks: the German to English Verbmobil task and French to English Canadian Hansards task.The article is structured as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "40">Section 2 gives a short introduction to the trans lation model used and reports on other approaches to the search problem in statistical MT. In Section 3, a DP-based search approach is presented, along with appropriate pruning techniques that yield an efficient beam search algorithm.</S>

			<S sid ="43" ssid = "1">2.1 IBM Translation Approach.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "2">In this article, we use the translation model presented in Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "3">(1993), and the mathematical notation we use here is taken from that paper as well: a source string 1 = f1 ··· fj ··· fJ is to be translated into a target string eI = e1 ··· ei ··· eI . Here, I is the length of the target string, and J is the length of the source string.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "4">Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability as given by Bayes’ 1 The word reordering restriction used in the search procedure described in Berger et al.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "5">(1996) is not.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "6">mentioned in Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "7">(1993), although exactly the translation model described there is used.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "8">Equivalently, we use exactly the translation model described in Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "9">(1993) but try different reordering restrictions for the DP-based search procedure.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "10">98 Figure 1 Architecture of the statistical translation approach based on Bayes’ decision rule.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "11">decision rule: ˆeI = arg max{Pr (eI | f J )} 1 I 1 1 1 = arg max{Pr (eI ) · Pr(f J | eI )} (1) I 1 1 1 1 Pr (eI ) is the language model of the target language, whereas Pr (f J | eI ) is the string 1 1 1translation model.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "12">The language model probability is computed using a trigram lan guage model.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "13">The string translation probability Pr (f J | eI ) is modeled using a series of 1 1five models of increasing complexity in training.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "14">Here, the model used for the trans lation experiments is the IBM4 model.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "15">This model uses the same parameter set as the IBM5 model, which in preliminary experiments did not yield better translationresults.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "16">The actual implementation used during the experiments is described in Al Onaizan et al.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "17">(1999) and in Och and Ney (2000).</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "18">The argmax operation denotes the search problem (i.e., the generation of the output sentence in the target language).</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "19">The overall architecture of the statistical translation approach is summarized in Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "20">In general, as shown in this figure, there may be additional transformations to make the translation task simpler for the algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "21">The transformations may range from simple word categorization to more complex preprocessing steps that require someparsing of the source string.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "22">In this article, however, we will use only word catego 99 rization as an explicit transformation step.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "23">In the search procedure both the language and the translation model are applied after the text transformation steps.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "24">The following “types” of parameters are used for the IBM4 translation model: Lexicon probabilities: We use the lexicon probability p(f | e) for translating the single target word e as the single source word f . A source word f may be translated by the “null” word e0 (i.e., it does not produce any target word e).</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "25">A translation probability p(f | e0 ) is trained along with the regular translation probabilities.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "26">Fertilities: A single target word e may be aligned to n = 0, 1 or more source words.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "27">This is explicitly modeled by the fertility parameter φ(n | e): the probability that the target word e is translated by n source words is φ(n | e).</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "28">The fertility for the “null” word is treated specially (for details see Brown et al. [1993]).</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "29">Berger et al.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "30">(1996) describes the extension of a partial hypothesis by a pair of target words (e1, e), where e1 is not connected to any source word f . In this case, the so-called spontaneous target word e1 is accounted for with the fertility.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "31">Here, the translation probability φ(0 | e1) and no- translation probability p(f | e1).</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "32">Class-based distortion probabilities: When covering a source sentence position j, we use distortion probabilities that depend on the previously covered source sentence positions (we say that a source sentence position j is covered for a partial hypothesis when it is taken account of in the translation process by generating a target word or the “null” word e0 ).</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "33">In Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "34">(1993), two types of distortion probabilities are distinguished: (1) the leftmost word of a set of source words f aligned to the same target word e (which is called the “head”) is placed, and (2) the remaining source words are placed.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "35">Two separate distributions are used for these two cases.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "36">For placing the “head” the center function center (i) (Brown et al. [1993] uses the notation 8i ) is used: the average position of the source words with which the target word ei−1 is aligned.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "37">The distortion probabilities are class-based: They depend on the word class F (f ) of a covered source word f as well as on the word class E (e) of the previously generated target word e. The classes are automatically trained (Brown et al. 1992).</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "38">When the IBM4 model parameters are used during search, an input sentence can be processed one source position at a time in a certain order primarily determined by the distortion probabilities.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "39">We will use the following simplified set of translation model parameters: lexicon probabilities p(f | e) and distortion probabilities p(j | j1, J).</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "40">Here, j is the currently covered input sentence position and j1 is the previously covered input sentence position.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "41">The input sentence length J is included, since we would like to think of the distortion probability as normalized according to J. No fertility probabilities or “null” word probabilities are used; thus each source word f is translated as exactly one target word e and each target word e is translated as exactly one source word f . The simplified notation will help us to focus on the most relevant details of the DP-based search procedure.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "42">The simplified set of parameters leads to an unrealistic assumption about the length of the source and target sentence, namely, I = J. During the translation experiments we will, of course, not make this assumption.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "43">The implementation details for using the full set of IBM4 model parameters are given in Section 3.9.2.</S>

			<S sid ="97" ssid = "55">The priority queues are limited in size, and only the 1,000 hypotheses with the highest probability are maintained.</S>

			<S sid ="119" ssid = "2">To explicitly describe the word order difference between source and target language, Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "3">(1993) introduced an alignment concept, in which a source position j is mapped to exactly one target position i: regular alignment: j → i = aj 101 .

			<S sid ="121" ssid = "4">For each German source word there is exactly one English target word on the alignment path.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "5">An example for this kind of alignment is given in Figure 2, in which each German source position j is mapped to an English target position i. In Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "6">(1993), this alignment concept is used for model IBM1 through model IBM5.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "7">For search purposes, we use the inverted alignment concept as introduced in Niessen et al.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "8">(1998) and Ney et al.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "9">(2000).</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "10">An inverted alignment is defined as follows: inverted alignment: i → j = bi Here, a target position i is mapped to a source position j. The coverage constraint for an inverted alignment is not expressed by the notation: Each source position j should be “hit” exactly once by the path of the inverted alignment bI = b1 ··· bi ··· bI . The advantage of the inverted alignment concept is that we can construct target sentence hypotheses from bottom to top along the positions of the target sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "11">Using the inverted alignments in the maximum approximation, we rewrite equation (1) to obtain the following search criterion, in which we are looking for the most likely target 102 Figure 3 Illustration of the transitions in the regular and in the inverted alignment model.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "12">The regular alignment model (left figure) is used to generate the sentence from left to right; the inverted alignment model (right figure) is used to generate the sentence from bottom to top.</S>

Note that in equation (2) two products over i are merged into a single product over i. The translation probability p(f J | eI ) is computed in 1 1 the maximum approximation using the distortion and the lexicon probabilities.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "14">Finally, p(J | I) is the sentence length model, which will be dropped in the following (it is not used in the IBM4 translation model).</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "15">For each source sentence f J to be translated, we are searching for the unknown mapping that optimizes equation (2): i → (bi , ei ) In Section 3.3, we will introduce an auxiliary quantity that can be evaluated recursively using DP to find this unknown mapping.</S>

			<S sid ="333" ssid = "216">The number of surviving hypotheses is controlled by four kinds of thresholds: • the coverage pruning threshold tC • the coverage histogram threshold nC • the cardinality pruning threshold tc • the cardinality histogram threshold nc For the coverage and the cardinality pruning, the probability Qe1 (e, C, j) is adjusted to take into account the uncovered source sentence positions ¯ = {1, ...</S>
			<S sid ="334" ssid = "217">, J}\C. To make 114 this adjustment, for a source word f at an uncovered source position, we precompute an upper bound ¯p(f ) for the product of language model and lexicon probability: ¯p(f ) = max p(e e1, e11) p(f e) e11 ,e1 ,e The above optimization is carried out only over the word trigrams (e, e1, e11) that have actually been seen in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="335" ssid = "218">Additionally, the observation pruning described below is applied to the possible translations e of a source word f . The upper bound is used in the beam search concept to increase the comparability between hypotheses covering different coverage sets.</S>
			<S sid ="336" ssid = "219">Even more benefit from the upper bound ¯p(f ) can be expected if the distortion and the fertility probabilities are taken into account (Tillmann 2001).</S>
			<S sid ="337" ssid = "220">Using the definition of ¯p(f ), the following modified probability Q¯ e1 (e, C, j) is used to replace the original probability Qe1 (e, C, j), and all pruning is applied to the new probability: Q¯ e1 (e, C, j) = Qe1 (e, C, j) · n ¯p(fj ) j∈ ¯ For the translation experiments, equation (3) is recursively evaluated over subsets of source positions of equal cardinality.</S>
			<S sid ="338" ssid = "221">For reasons of brevity, we omit the state descrip tion S in equation (3), since no separate pruning according to the states S is carried out.</S>
			<S sid ="339" ssid = "222">The set of surviving hypotheses for each cardinality c is referred to as the beam.</S>
			<S sid ="340" ssid = "223">The size of the beam for cardinality c depends on the ambiguity of the translation task for that cardinality.</S>
			<S sid ="341" ssid = "224">To fully exploit the speedup of the DP beam search, the search space is dynamically constructed as described in Tillmann, Vogel, Ney, Zubiaga, and Sawaf (1997), rather than using a static search space.</S>
			<S sid ="342" ssid = "225">To carry out the pruning, the maximum probabilities with respect to each coverage set C and cardinality c are computed: • Coverage pruning: Hypotheses are distinguished according to the subset of covered positions C. The probability Qˆ (C) is defined: Qˆ ( ) = max Q¯ e1 (e, , j) e,e1 ,j • Cardinality pruning: Hypotheses are distinguished according to the cardinality c(C) of subsets C of covered positions.</S>
			<S sid ="343" ssid = "226">The probability Qˆ (c) is defined for all hypotheses with c(C) = c: Qˆ (c) = max Qˆ ( ) C c(C)=c The coverage pruning threshold tC and the cardinality pruning threshold tc are used to prune active hypotheses.</S>
			<S sid ="344" ssid = "227">We call this pruning translation pruning.</S>
			<S sid ="345" ssid = "228">Hypotheses are pruned according to their translation probability: Q¯ e1 (e, C, j) &lt; tC · Qˆ (C) Q¯ e1 (e, C, j) &lt; tc · Qˆ (c) For the translation experiments presented in Section 4, the negative logarithms of the actual pruning thresholds tc and tC are reported.</S>
			<S sid ="346" ssid = "229">A hypothesis (e1, e, C, j) is discarded if its probability is below the corresponding threshold.</S>
			<S sid ="347" ssid = "230">For the current experiments, the 115 coverage and the cardinality threshold are constant for different coverage sets C and cardinalities c. Together with the translation pruning, histogram pruning is carried out: The overall number N(C) of active hypotheses for the coverage set C and the overall number N(c) of active hypotheses for all subsets of a given cardinality may not exceed a given number; again, different numbers are used for coverage and cardinality pruning.</S>
			<S sid ="348" ssid = "231">The coverage histogram pruning is denoted by nC , and the cardinality histogram pruning is denoted by nc : N(C) &gt; nC N(c) &gt; nc If the numbers of active hypotheses for each coverage set C and cardinality c, N(C) and N(c), exceed the above thresholds, only the partial hypotheses with the highest translation probabilities are retained (e.g., we may use nC = 1,000 for the coverage histogram pruning).</S>
			<S sid ="349" ssid = "232">The third type of pruning conducted observation pruning: The number of words that may be produced by a source word f is limited.</S>
			<S sid ="350" ssid = "233">For each source language word f the list of its possible translations e is sorted according to p(f | e) · puni (e) where puni (e) is the unigram probability of the target language word e.

			<S sid ="352" ssid = "235">In this section, we describe the implementation of the beam search algorithm presented in the previous sections and show how it is applied to the full set of IBM4 model parameters.</S>
			<S sid ="353" ssid = "236">3.9.1 Baseline DP Implementation.</S>
			<S sid ="354" ssid = "237">The implementation described here is similar to that used in beam search speech recognition systems, as presented in Ney et al.</S>
			<S sid ="355" ssid = "238">(1992).</S>
			<S sid ="356" ssid = "239">The similarities are given mainly in the following: • The implementation is data driven.</S>
			<S sid ="357" ssid = "240">Both its time and memory requirements are strictly linear in the number of path hypotheses (disregarding the sorting steps explained in this section).</S>
			<S sid ="358" ssid = "241">• The search procedure is developed to work most efficiently when the input sentences are processed mainly monotonically from left to right.</S>
			<S sid ="359" ssid = "242">The algorithm works cardinality-synchronously, meaning that all the hypotheses that are processed cover subsets of source sentence positions of equal cardinality c. • Since full search is prohibitive, we use a beam search concept, as in speech recognition.</S>
			<S sid ="360" ssid = "243">We use appropriate pruning techniques in connection with our cardinality-synchronous search procedure.</S>
			<S sid ="361" ssid = "244">Table 4 shows a two-list implementation of the search algorithm given in Table 2 in which the beam pruning is included.</S>

			<S sid ="367" ssid = "250">A set S of active hypotheses is expanded for each cardinality c using lexicon model, language model, and distortion model probabilities.</S>
			<S sid ="368" ssid = "251">The newly generated hypotheses are added to the hypothesis set Snew ; for hypotheses that are not distinguished according to our DP approach, only the best partial hypothesis is retained for further consideration.</S>

			<S sid ="370" ssid = "253">During the partial hypothesis extensions, an anticipated pruning is carried out: Hypotheses are discarded before they are considered for recombination and are never added to Snew .</S>
			<S sid ="371" ssid = "254">(The anticipated pruning is not shown in Table 4.</S>
			<S sid ="372" ssid = "255">It is based on the pruning thresholds described in Section 3.8.)

			<S sid ="373" ssid = "256">(Instead of sorting the partial hypothe ses, we might have used hashing.)</S>
			<S sid ="374" ssid = "257">First, the partial hypotheses are sorted according to their translation scores (within the implementation, all probabilities are converted into translation scores by taking the negative logarithm − log()).</S>
			<S sid ="375" ssid = "258">Cardinality prun ing can then be carried out simply by running down the list of hypotheses, starting with the maximum-probability hypothesis, and applying the cardinality thresholds.</S>
			<S sid ="376" ssid = "259">Then, the partial hypotheses are sorted a second time according to their coverage set C and their translation score.</S>
			<S sid ="377" ssid = "260">After this sorting step, all partial hypotheses that cover the same subset of source sentence positions are located in consecutive fragments in the overall list of partial hypotheses.</S>
			<S sid ="378" ssid = "261">Coverage pruning is carried out in a single run over the list of partial hypotheses: For each fragment corresponding to the same coverage set C, the coverage pruning threshold is applied.</S>
			<S sid ="379" ssid = "262">The partial hypotheses that survive the two pruning stages are then written into the so-called bookkeeping array (Ney et al. 1992).</S>

			<S sid ="383" ssid = "266">In this section, we outline how the DP-based beam search approach can be carried out using the full set of IBM4 parameters.</S>
			<S sid ="384" ssid = "267">(More details can be found in Tillmann [2001] or in the cited papers.)</S>
			<S sid ="385" ssid = "268">First, the full set of IBM4 parameters does not make the simplifying assumption given in Section 3.1, namely, that source and target sentences are of equal length: Either a target word e may be aligned with several source words (its fertility is greater than one) or a single source word may produce zero, one, or two target words, as described in Berger et al.</S>
			<S sid ="386" ssid = "269">(1996), or both.</S>
			<S sid ="387" ssid = "270">Zero target words are generated if f is aligned to the “null” word e0 . Generating a single target word e is the regular case.</S>
			<S sid ="388" ssid = "271">Two target words (e1, e11) may be generated.</S>
			<S sid ="389" ssid = "272">The costs for generating the target word e1 are given by its fertility φ(0 | e1) and the language model probability; no lexicon probability is used.</S>
			<S sid ="390" ssid = "273">During the experiments, we restrict ourselves to triples of target words (e, e1, e11) actually seen in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="391" ssid = "274">This approach is used for the French-to-English translation experiments presented in this article.</S>
			<S sid ="392" ssid = "275">Another approach for mapping a single source language word to several target language words involves preprocessing by the word-joining algorithm given in Till- mann (2001), which is similar to the approach presented in Och, Tillmann, and Ney (1999).</S>
			<S sid ="393" ssid = "276">Target words are joined during a training phase, and several joined target language words are dealt with as a new lexicon entry.</S>
			<S sid ="394" ssid = "277">This approach is used for the German-to-English translation experiments presented in this article.</S>
			<S sid ="395" ssid = "278">In order to deal with the IBM4 fertility parameters within the DP-based concept, we adopt the distinction between open and closed hypotheses given in Berger et al.</S>
			<S sid ="396" ssid = "279">(1996).</S>
			<S sid ="397" ssid = "280">A hypothesis is said to be open if it is to be aligned with more source positions than it currently is (i.e., at least two).</S>
			<S sid ="398" ssid = "281">Otherwise it is called closed.</S>
			<S sid ="399" ssid = "282">The difference between open and closed is used to process the input sentence one position a time (for details see Tillmann 2001).</S>
			<S sid ="400" ssid = "283">The word reordering restrictions and the beam search pruning techniques are directly carried over to the full set of IBM4 parameters, since they are based on restrictions on the coverage vectors C only.</S>
			<S sid ="401" ssid = "284">To ensure its correctness, the implementation was tested by carrying out forced alignments on 500 German-to-English training sentence pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="402" ssid = "285">In a forced alignment,the source sentence f J and the target sentence eI are kept fixed, and a full search with 1 1 out reordering restrictions is carried out only over the unknown alignment aJ . The language model probability is divided out, and the resulting probability is compared to the Viterbi probability as obtained by the training procedure.</S>
			<S sid ="403" ssid = "286">For 499 training sentencesthe Viterbi alignment probability as obtained by the forced-alignment search was exactly the same as the one produced by the training procedure.</S>
			<S sid ="404" ssid = "287">In one case the forced alignment search did obtain a better Viterbi probability than the training procedure.</S>

			<S sid ="413" ssid = "9">To measure the performance of the translation methods, we use three types of au tomatic and easy-to-use measures of the translation errors.</S>
			<S sid ="414" ssid = "10">Additionally, a subjective evaluation involving human judges is carried out (Niessen et al. 2000).</S>
			<S sid ="415" ssid = "11">The following evaluation criteria are employed: • WER (word error rate): The WER is computed as the minimum number of substitution, insertion, and deletion operations that have to be performed to convert the generated string into the reference target string.</S>
			<S sid ="416" ssid = "12">This performance criterion is widely used in speech recognition.</S>
			<S sid ="417" ssid = "13">The minimum is computed using a DP algorithm and is typically referred to as edit or Levenshtein distance.</S>
			<S sid ="418" ssid = "14">• mWER (multireference WER): We use the Levenshtein distance between the automatic translation and several reference translations as a measure of the translation errors.</S>
			<S sid ="419" ssid = "15">For example, on the Verbmobil TEST-331 test set, an average of six reference translations per automatic translation are available.</S>
			<S sid ="420" ssid = "16">The Levenshtein distance between the automatic translation and each of the reference translations is computed, and the minimum Levenshtein distance is taken.</S>
			<S sid ="421" ssid = "17">The resulting measure, the mWER, is more robust than the WER, which takes into account only a single reference translation.</S>
			<S sid ="422" ssid = "18">• PER (position-independent word error rate): In the case in which only a single reference translation per sentence is available, we introduce as an additional measure the position-independent word error rate (PER).</S>
			<S sid ="423" ssid = "19">This measure compares the words in the two sentences without taking the word order into account.</S>
			<S sid ="424" ssid = "20">Words in the reference translation that have no counterpart in the translated sentence are counted as substitution errors.</S>
			<S sid ="425" ssid = "21">Depending on whether the translated sentence is longer or shorter than the reference translation, the remaining words result in either insertion (if the translated sentence is longer) or deletion (if the translated sentence is shorter) errors.</S>
			<S sid ="426" ssid = "22">The PER is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the WER.</S>
			<S sid ="427" ssid = "23">The PER is more robust than the WER since it ignores translation errors due to different word order in the translated and reference sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="428" ssid = "24">• SSER (subjective sentence error rate): For a more fine-grained evaluation of the translation results and to check the validity of the automatic evaluation measures subjective judgments by test persons are carried out (Niessen et al. 2000).</S>
			<S sid ="429" ssid = "25">The following scale for the error count per sentence is used in these subjective evaluations: 0.0 : semantically correct and syntactically correct ··· : ··· 0.5 : semantically correct and syntactically wrong ··· : ··· 1.0 : semantically wrong (independent of syntax) Each translated sentence is judged by a human examiner according to the above error scale; several human judges may be involved in judging the same translated sentence.</S>

			<S sid ="434" ssid = "30">The translation system is tested on the Verbmobil task(Wahlster 2000).</S>
			<S sid ="435" ssid = "31">In that task, the goal is the translation of spontaneous speech in face to-face situations for an appointment scheduling domain.</S>
			<S sid ="436" ssid = "32">We carry out experiments for both translation directions: German to English and English to German.</S>
			<S sid ="437" ssid = "33">Although the Verbmobil task is still a limited-domain task, it is rather difficult in terms of vocabulary size, namely, about 5,000 words or more for each of the two languages; second, the syntactic structures of the sentences are rather unrestricted.</S>
			<S sid ="438" ssid = "34">Although the ultimate goal of the Verbmobil project is the translation of spoken language, the input used for the translation experiments reported on in this article is mainly the (more or less) correct orthographic transcription of the spoken sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="439" ssid = "35">Thus, the effects of spontaneous speech are present in the corpus; the effect of speech recognition errors, however, is not covered.</S>
			<S sid ="440" ssid = "36">The corpus consists of 58,073 training pairs; its characteristics are given in Table 5.</S>
			<S sid ="441" ssid = "37">For the translation experiments, a trigram language model with a perplexity of 28.1 is used.</S>
			<S sid ="442" ssid = "38">The following two test corpora are used for the translation experiments: TEST-331: This test set consists of 331 test sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="443" ssid = "39">Only automatic evaluation is carried out on this test corpus: The WER and the mWER are computed.</S>
			<S sid ="444" ssid = "40">For each test sentence in the source language there is a range of acceptable reference translations (six on average) provided by a human translator, who is asked to produce word-to-word translations wherever it is possible.</S>
			<S sid ="445" ssid = "41">Part of the reference sentences are obtained by correcting automatic translations of the test sentences that are produced using the approach presented in this article with different reordering constraints.</S>
			<S sid ="446" ssid = "42">The other part is produced from the source sentences without looking at any of their translations.</S>
			<S sid ="447" ssid = "43">The TEST-331 test set is used as held-out data for parameter optimization (for the language mode scaling factor and for the distortion model scaling factor).</S>
			<S sid ="448" ssid = "44">Furthermore, the beam search experiments in which the effect of the different pruning thresholds is demonstrated are carried out on the TEST-331 test set.</S>

			<S sid ="452" ssid = "48">4.2.2 Preprocessing Steps.</S>
			<S sid ="453" ssid = "49">To improve the translation performance the following preprocessing steps are carried out: Categorization: We use some categorization, which consists of replacing a single word by a category.</S>
			<S sid ="454" ssid = "50">The only words that are replaced by a category label are proper nouns denoting German cities.</S>
			<S sid ="455" ssid = "51">Using the new labeled corpus, all probability models are trained anew.</S>
			<S sid ="456" ssid = "52">To produce translations in the “normal” language, the categories are translated by rule and are inserted into the target sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="457" ssid = "53">Word joining: Target language words are joined using a method similar to the one described in Och, Tillmann, and Ney (1999).</S>
			<S sid ="458" ssid = "54">Words are joined to handle cases like the German compound noun “Zahnarzttermin” for the English “dentist’s appointment,” because a single word has to be mapped to two or more target words.</S>
			<S sid ="459" ssid = "55">The word joining is applied only to the target language words; the source language sentences remain unchanged.</S>
			<S sid ="460" ssid = "56">During the search process several joined target language words may be generated by a single source language word.</S>
			<S sid ="461" ssid = "57">Manual lexicon: To account for unseen words in the test sentences and to obtain a greater number of focused translation probabilities p(f | e), we use a bilin gual GermanEnglish dictionary.</S>
			<S sid ="462" ssid = "58">For each word e in the target vocabulary, we create a list of source translations f according to this dictionary.</S>
			<S sid ="463" ssid = "59">The translation probability pdic (f | e) for the dictionary entry (f , e) is defined as  1 pdic (f | e) =  Ne if (f , e) is in dictionary 0 otherwise where Ne is the number of source words listed as translations of the target word e. The dictionary probability pdic (f | e) is linearly combined with the automatically trained translation probabilities paut (f | e) to obtain smoothed probabilities p(f | e): p(f | e) = (1 − λ) · pdic (f | e)+ λ · paut (f | e) For the translation experiments, the value of the interpolation parameter is fixed at λ = 0.5.</S>
			<S sid ="464" ssid = "60">4.2.3 Effect of the Scaling Factors.</S>
			<S sid ="465" ssid = "61">In speech recognition, in which Bayes’ decision rule is applied, a language model scaling factor αLM is used; a typical value is αLM ≈ 15.</S>
			<S sid ="466" ssid = "62">This scaling factor is employed because the language model probabilities are more reliably estimated than the acoustic probabilities.</S>
			<S sid ="467" ssid = "63">Following this use of a language model scaling factor in speech recognition, such a factor is introduced into statistical MT, too.</S>
			<S sid ="468" ssid = "64">The optimization criterion in equation (1) is modified as follows: ˆeI = arg max{p(eI )αLM · p(f J | eI )} 1 I 1 1 1 1 where p(eI ) is the language model probability of the target language sentence.</S>

			<S sid ="681" ssid = "277">As can be seen in Table 15 for the translation direction French to English and in Table 16 for the translation direction English to French, the word error rates are rather high compared to those for the Verbmobil task.</S>

			<S sid ="696" ssid = "292">The computation time is also rather high compared to the Verbmobil task: For the S3 constraint, the average translation time is about 3 minutes per sentence for the translation direction English to French and about 10 minutes per sentence for the translation direction French to English.</S>
			<S sid ="697" ssid = "293">The following parameter setting is used for the experiment conducted here: tC = 5.0, tc = 10.0, nC = 250, and to = 12.</S>

			<S sid ="700" ssid = "296">As for the German- to-English translation experiments, word reordering is restricted so that it may not cross punctuation boundaries.</S>
			<S sid ="701" ssid = "297">The resulting fragment lengths are much larger for the translation direction English to French, and still larger for the translation direction French to English, when compared to the fragment lengths for the translation direction German to English, hence the high CPU times.</S>
			<S sid ="702" ssid = "298">In an additional experiment for the translation direction French to English and the reordering constraint S3, we find we can speed up the translation time to about 18 seconds per sentence by using the following parameter setting: tC = 3.0, tc = 7.5, nC = 20, nc = 400, and no = 5.</S>

			<S sid ="707" ssid = "1">We have presented a DP-based beam search algorithm for the IBM4 translation model.</S>
			<S sid ="708" ssid = "2">The approach is based on a DP solution to the TSP, and it gains efficiency by imposing constraints on the allowed word reorderings between source and target language.</S>
			<S sid ="709" ssid = "3">A data-driven search organization in conjunction with appropriate pruning techniques 129 Example translations for the translation direction French to English using the S3 reordering constraint.</S>
			<S sid ="710" ssid = "4">Input Je crois que cela donne une bonne ide´ e de les principes a` retenir et de ce que devraient eˆ tre nos responsabilite´ s. S3 I think it is a good idea of the principles and to what should be our responsibility.</S>
			<S sid ="711" ssid = "5">Input Je pense que, inde´ pendamment de notre parti, nous trouvons tous cela inacceptable.</S>
			<S sid ="712" ssid = "6">S3 I think, regardless of our party, we find that unacceptable.</S>

			<S sid ="714" ssid = "8">S3 I have the intention of speaking today about the many improvements in pensions for all Canadians especially those programs.</S>

			<S sid ="717" ssid = "11">is proposed.</S>
			<S sid ="718" ssid = "12">For the medium-sized Verbmobil task, a sentence can be translated in a few seconds on average, with a small number of search errors and no performance degradation as measured by the word error criterion used.</S>
			<S sid ="719" ssid = "13">Word reordering is parameterized using a set of four parameters, in such a way that it can easily be adopted to new translation directions.</S>
			<S sid ="720" ssid = "14">A finite-state control is added, and its usefulness is demonstrated for the translation direction German to English, in which the word order difference between the two languages is mainly due to the German verb group.</S>
			<S sid ="721" ssid = "15">Future work might aim at a tighter integration of the IBM4 model distortion probabilities and the finite-state control; the finite-state control itself may be learned from training data.</S>
			<S sid ="722" ssid = "16">The applicability of the algorithm applied in the experiments in this article is not restricted to the IBM translation models or to the simplified translation model used in the description of the algorithm in Section 3.</S>
			<S sid ="723" ssid = "17">Since the efficiency of the beam search approach is based on restrictions on the allowed coverage vectors C alone, the approach may be used for different types of translation models as well (e.g., for the multiword-based translation model proposed in Och, Tillmann, and Ney [1999]).</S>
			<S sid ="724" ssid = "18">On the other hand, since the decoding problem for the IBM4 translation model is provably NP-complete, as shown in Knight (1999) and Germann et al.</S>
			<S sid ="725" ssid = "19">(2001), wordreordering restrictions as introduced in this article are essential for obtaining an effi cient search algorithm that guarantees that a solution close to the optimal one will be found.</S>
			<S sid ="726" ssid = "20">Appendix: Quantification of Reordering Restrictions To quantify the reordering restrictions in Section 3.5, the four non-negative numbers numskip, widthskip, nummove , and widthmove are used (width skip corresponds to L, widthmove corresponds to R in Section 3.4; here, we use a more intuitive notation).</S>
			<S sid ="727" ssid = "21">Within the implementation of the DP search, the restrictions are provided to the 130 algorithm as an input parameter of the following type: S numskip widthskip M nummove widthmove The meaning of the reordering string is as follows: The two numbers following S that are separated by an underscore describe the way words may be skipped; the two numbers following M that are separated by an underscore describe the way words may be moved during word reordering.</S>
			<S sid ="728" ssid = "22">The first number after S and M denotes the number of positions that may be skipped or moved, respectively (e.g., for the translation direction German to English [GE in the chart below], one position may be skipped and two positions may be moved).</S>
			<S sid ="729" ssid = "23">The second number after S and M restricts the distance a word may be skipped or moved, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="730" ssid = "24">These “width” parameters restrict the word reordering to take place within a “window” of a certain size, established by the distance between the positions lmin (C) and rmax (C) as defined in Section 3.5.</S>
			<S sid ="731" ssid = "25">In the notation, either the substring headed by S or that headed by M (or both) may be omitted altogether to indicate that the corresponding reordering is not allowed.</S>
			<S sid ="732" ssid = "26">Any numerical value in the string may be set to INF, denoting that an arbitrary number of positions may be skipped/moved or that the moving or skipping distance may be arbitrarily large.</S>
			<S sid ="733" ssid = "27">The following reordering strings are used in this article: Word reordering Description string E The empty string denotes the reordering restriction in which (short: MON) no reordering is allowed.</S>
			<S sid ="734" ssid = "28">S 01 04 M 02 10 This string describes the German-to-English word reordering.</S>
			<S sid ="735" ssid = "29">(short: GE) Up to one word may be skipped for at most 4 positions, and up to two words may be moved up to 10 positions.</S>
			<S sid ="736" ssid = "30">S 02 10 M 01 04 This string describes the English-to-German word reordering.</S>
			<S sid ="737" ssid = "31">(short: EG) Up to two words may be skipped for at most 10 positions and up to one word may be moved for up to 4 positions.</S>
			<S sid ="738" ssid = "32">S 03 INF This string describes the IBM-style word reordering (short: S3) given in Section 3.6.</S>
			<S sid ="739" ssid = "33">Up to three words may be skipped for an unrestricted number of positions.</S>
			<S sid ="740" ssid = "34">No words may be moved.</S>
			<S sid ="741" ssid = "35">S INF INF or These strings denote the word reordering without M INF INF restrictions.</S>
			<S sid ="742" ssid = "36">(short: NO) The word reordering strings can be directly used as input parameters to the DP-based search procedure to test different reordering restrictions within a single implementation.</S>
