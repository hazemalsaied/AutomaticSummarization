			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">In this paper, we address the question of how part­ of-speech ( POS) information can help improv­ ing the quality of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">One of the main problems when translat­ ing from a language with hm·dly any inflectional morphology (which is English in our experiments) into one with richer morphology (here: Spanish and Catalan) is the production of the correct in­ flected form in the target lan guage.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">We introduce transformations to the English string that are based on the part-of-speech information and show how this knowledge source can help SMT.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Systematic evaluations will show that the quality of the gen erated translations is improved.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">The transfonnations we apply arc the following: Treatment of verbs In Catalan and Spanish, the pronoun before a verb is often omitted and in­ stead, the person is expressed via the ending of the verb.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">The smne holds for future tense and for the modes expressed through &apos;would &apos; and &apos;should&apos; in English.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Since this makes it hard to generate the correct translation of a given English verb, we propose a method re­ sulting in English word forms containing suf­ ficient infonnation.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Question inversion In English, interrogative phrases have a word order that is different from declarative sentences: Either an auxil­ iary &apos;do·is inserted or the order of verb and pronoun is inverted.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Since this is dilTerent in Spanish and Catalan, we modify the word order in English to make it more similar to the Spanish/Catalan one and to help the verb treatment mentioned above.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">The paper is organized as follows: Related work is treated in Section 2.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">In Section 3, we shortly review the statistical approach to machine transla­ tion.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Then, we introduce the transfonnations that we apply to the less inflected language of the two under consideration (namely English) in Section 4.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">After describing the maximum entropy approach and the training procedure we use for the statisti­ cal lexicon in Section 5, we present results on the trilingual LC-STAR corpus in Section 6.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Then, we conclude and present ideas about future work in Section 7.</S>

			<S sid ="41" ssid = "1">Inflected Language When translating from English into languages with a highly inflected morphology, the production of the cotTect fullfonn often causes problems.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "2">Our experience on several corpora shows that the error rate or a translation from English into morpholog­ ically richer languages decreases by 10% relative if we aim at producing only the correct baseform instead of the fully inflected word.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "3">The transfer of the meaning expressed in the baseform is easier than deciding on the correct inOecLed form.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "4">4.1 Treatment of.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "5">Verbs Especially the translation of verbs is difficult since there are many different inflections in Spanish and Catalan whereas there are only few in En­ glish.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "6">Moreover, the pronouns and modals are of­ ten omiued in Spanish and CaLalan and this infor­ mation is expressed through the suffix.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "7">This makes it very hard for word-based systems to generate the correct inflection from the English verb which docs not contain sufficient information.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "8">Thus, sev­ eral English words will have to be aligned to the Spanish or Catalan verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "9">This process is rela tively difficult for the algorithm and causes noise in the statistical lexicon i C English pronouns are re­ garded as translations of Spanish or Catalan verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "10">In order to enrich the English verb with the needed information, we combine pronouns and/or modals with following verbs and treat those combinations as &apos;new&apos; Cullform words in English.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "11">Thus we can obtain the information needed to select the con·ect verb form in the target language from one single English word.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "12">The identif1cation or English pro­ nouns, modals and verbs was done by POS tag­ ging applied to the English part of the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "13">We decided to transform the source language in­ stead of the target language, because in this case we need only the POS tags of the source language as additional knowledge source and nothing else.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "14">Another possible approach would have been to split the suffix in the target language (e.g. &apos;esta&apos; into &apos;estar P3S&apos;).</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "15">This would require postprocess­ ing tools that are able to generate the correct verb ronn !&apos;rom the haserorm and the person and tense information.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "16">Table 1 gives examples of words that have been spliced to fonn new entries ol&apos; the English lexi­ con.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "17">For example, we splice the phrase &apos;you think&apos; to form the single entry &apos;you_think&apos; which con­ tains sufficient information for producing the cor­ rect Spanish verb form &apos;crees&apos; or the Catalan &apos;creus&apos;.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "18">Similarly, the modal auxiliaries can be added as well, like in the entry &apos;you_wilLhave&apos; which is much better suited for being translated into &apos;tendnis&apos; (Spanish) or &apos;tindras&apos; (Catalan) than the verb &apos;have&apos; alone.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "19">Moreover, in a single word based lexicon, three single entries would have to be added Cor the translation of &apos;you will have&apos; into &apos;tendras&apos;: (you,tendras), (will,tendras) and (have,tendnis), which spreads the translation prob­ ability over far too many entries and makes the probability distribution unfocused.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "20">As the last example in Table l shows, &apos;you can go&apos; is spliced only into two words instead of one in order to better match the Spanish/Catalan form.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "21">4.2 Question Treatment.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "22">In English interrogative phrases, either an auxil­ iary &apos;do&apos; is inserted or the order of verb and pro­ noun is inverted.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "23">The au x iliary &apos;do&apos; does not carry information that is relevant when translating into Table 1: Examples of spliced words in the English vocabulary I original I POS tags I spliced words I yo u go P R P V B P yo u_ go yo u we nt PR P V B D yo u we nt yo u thi nk PR P V BP yo u_ thi nk yo u wi ll ha ve P R P M D V B yo u wi ll ha ve yo u ca n go P R P M D V B yo u ca n go Spanish or Catalan.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "24">Thus, we can remove it from the sentence without hanning the translation pro­ cess (as described in (NicBen and Ney, 200la) for the language pair GermanEnglish).</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "25">However, we do not remove a question supporting &apos;do&apos; in past tense, i. e. &apos;did&apos; is kept in the phrase, because this is the only word containing the tense information.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "26">Afterwards, we can merge the pronoun and verb as depicted in Table 2: &apos;did you go&apos; is transformed into &apos;you_did go&apos;.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "27">We do not splice &apos;you_did&apos; and &apos;go&apos;, because the English simple past is translated into present perfect in Catalan; and it is very likel y to he translated into present perl&apos;ect in Spanish, es­ pecially in colloquial language as it is present in this task.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "28">The form &apos;you_did go&apos; is well suited to be translated into the Spanish &apos;has ido&apos; or the Cata­ lan &apos;has anat&apos;.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "29">IC there is no question supporting &apos;do&apos; and the or­ der of pronoun and verb is inverted see the exam­ ple &apos;how are you?&apos; in Table 3 - we first swap the two words and then perform the splicing step.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "30">This is done in order to avoid having two lexical entries with the same translation: for example, &apos;you_are &apos; and the interrogative &apos;are_you &apos; hoth have the same translation in Spanish or Catalan, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "31">Table 3 presents examples of transformed EngIish queslions.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "32">Comparing them to the Spanish and Catalan reference, we see that it is easier to find a word-to word mapping for the modified English sentences.</S>

			<S sid ="81" ssid = "9">This makes it impossible to trans­ late the verb itself, because it is then unknown to the system.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "10">The same holds for combinations of pronouns and verbs that are unseen in train­ ing, e. g. the training corpus contains the bigram &apos;1 went&apos;, but not the one &apos;she went&apos;.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "11">In order to overcome this problem, we train our lexicon model using maximum entropy.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "12">5.1 The Maximum Entropy Approach.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "13">The maximum entropy approach (Berger et al., 1996) presents a powerful framework for the com­ bination or several knowledge sources.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "14">This prin­ ciple recommends to choose the distribution which preserves as much uncertainty as possible in terms or maximizing the entropy.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "15">The distribution is re­ quired to satisfy constraints, which represent facts known from the data.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "16">These constraints are ex­ pressed on the basis of feature functions hm ( s , t), where ( s, t) is a pair of source and target word.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "17">The lexicon probability of a source word given the target word has the following functional form p(si L ) = .%&apos;t ) exp [LAmhm(s , L) l U l with the normalization factor where /\ = {Am} is the set of model parameters with one weight Am Cor each feature function hm.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "18">The features we usc in our model arc • a lexical feature (Cor the entries of Lhe trans­ formed vocabulary): hs&apos;,t&apos;(s , t ) = 8(s , s&apos; ) ·8(t, t&apos;) • the verb contained in a transformed lexicon entry (e.g. &apos;go&apos; Cor &apos;you_go&apos; or &apos;you_wi!Lgo): where 1, ift contains the verb v Verb(t, v) = { 0, otherwise This enables us to translate the verb alone even if it occurs in the training corpus only as a spliced entry.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "19">For an introduction to maximum entropy modeling and training procedures, the reader is refened to the corresponding literature, for instance (Berger et al., 1996) or (Ratnapark:hi, 1997).</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "20">5.2 Training.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "21">We performed the following training steps: • transform the English (= source language) part or the corpus as described in Seclions 4.1 and 4.2 • train the statistical translation system using this modi fled source language corpus 1 • with the resuiLing alignment, train the lexicon model using maximum entropy with the fea­ tures described in Section 5.1 This training can be pelformed using converg­ ing iterative training procedures like described by (Darroch and Ratcliff.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "22">1972) or (Della Pietra et al., 1997) 2 . The basic training procedures for the translation system and the language model need not be changed.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "23">5.3 Translation process.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "24">For translation, we can use an SMT system where the search algorithm does not have to be modified.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "25">Before the translation process, we transform the input in the same way as the training corpus be­ fore training the alignment (see Section 5.2).</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "26">We simply have to exclude those words from splicing where the splicing operation yields an unknown word.</S>

			<S sid ="100" ssid = "28">It comprises the languages English, Spanish and Catalan, whereof we used English as source and Spanish and Catalan as tar­ get languages.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "29">At the time of our experiments, we had about 13k sentences per language available; the statistics are given in Table 4.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "30">The corpus consists of transcriptions of sponta­ neously spoken dialogues.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "31">Thus, the sentences often lack correct syntactic structure.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "32">The domain of this task is appointment scheduling and travel arrangements.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "33">The POS information for the English part of the corpus was generated using the Brill tagger3.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "34">As Table 4 shows, the splicing operation increases the cardinality of the English vocabulary as well as the number of singletons significantly.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "35">Nevertheless, they are still below those numbers for Spanish and Catalan.</S>
			<SUBSECTION>6.2 Evaluation.</SUBSECTION>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "36">Metrics The quality of the output of our machine transla­ tion system is measured automatically by compar­ ing the generated translation to a given reference translation.</S>

			<S sid ="111" ssid = "39">Since some sentences in the develop and test set occur several times with different reference translations (which holds especially !&apos;or short sentences like &apos;okay, goodbye&apos;), we calculate the minimal dis­ tance to this set of references as proposed in (NieBen et al., 2000).</S>

			<SUBSECTION>6.3 Experimental Results.</SUBSECTION>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "45">We compared the two statistical lexica obtained from the baseline system and from the maximum entropy training on the transformed corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "46">For the baseline lexicon, we observed an average of 5.82 Catalan translation candidates per English.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "47">word and 6.16 Spanish translation candidates.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "48">These numbers are significantly reduced in the lexicon which was trained on the transformed corpus using maximum entropy: there, we have an average of 4.20 for Catalan and 4.46 for Spanish.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "49">Especially for (nominative) English pronouns (which have many verbs as translation candidates in the baseline lexicon), the number of translation candidates was substantially scaled down by a factor around 4.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "50">This shows that our method was successful in producing a more focused lexicon probability distribution.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "51">We performed translation experiments with an implementation of the IBM4 translation model (Brown et al., 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "52">A description of the system can be found in (Tillmann and Ney, 20 02 ).</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "53">Table 5 presents an assessment or translation qual­ ity for both the language pairs English--Catalan and EnglishSpanish.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "54">We see that there is a signif­ icant decrease in error rate for the translation into Catalan.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "55">This change is consistent across bother­ ror rates, the WER and 100BLEU.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "56">For translations from English into Spanish, the improvement is less substantial.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "57">A reason for this might be that the Spanish vocabulary contains more entries and the ratio between l&apos;uHrorms and baseforms is higher: 1.57 for Spanish versus 1.53 for Catalan4 • This makes it more difficult for the system to choose the correct inflection when gen­ erating a Spanish sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "58">We assume that the extension or our approach to other word classes than verbs will yield a quality gain for translations into Spanish.</S>

			<S sid ="135" ssid = "63">This can be avoided by the splicing of words.</S>
			<S sid ="136" ssid = "64">In the last example, we see that the baseline system generates one word each for the English &apos;I prefer&apos; and does not find the correct translation, whereas transformations yield an accurate transla­ tion of this expression, because the spliced word contains sul&apos;ficienl inl&apos;ormalion.</S>

			<S sid ="139" ssid = "67">Using POS tags as additional knowledge source, we enrich the English verbs such that they contain more information relevant for selecting the conect inflected form in the target language.</S>
			<S sid ="140" ssid = "68">The lexicon model was then trained using the maxi­ mum entropy approach, taking the verbs as addi­ tional features.</S>
			<S sid ="141" ssid = "69">Results were given for translation from English into Spanish and Catalan on the LC-STAR cor­ pus which consists of spontaneously spoken dia­ logues in the domain of appointment scheduling and travel arrangement.</S>
			<S sid ="142" ssid = "70">Our experiments show that translation quality can be signif1cantly in­ creased through the use of our approach: the word error rate on the Catalan development set for ex­ ample decreased by 2.5% absolute.</S>
			<S sid ="143" ssid = "71">We plan to investigate other methods of enrich­ ing the English words with information.</S>
			<S sid ="144" ssid = "72">It will be interesting to see how other word classes, e. g. nouns, can be handled in order to improve quality of translations into languages with a highly inflected morphology.</S>
