			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Machine translation (MT) is a hard problem, because natural languages are highly complex, many words have various meanings and different possible translations, sentences might have various readings, and the relationships between linguistic entities are often vague.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">In addition, it is sometimes necessary to take world knowledge into account.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">The number of relevant dependencies is much too large and those dependencies are too complex to take them all into account in a machine translation system.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Given these boundary conditions, a machine translation system has to make decisions (produce translations) given incomplete knowledge.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">In such a case, a principled approach to solving that problem is to use the concepts of statistical decision theory to try to make optimal decisions given incomplete knowledge.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">This is the goal of statistical machine translation.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">The use of statistical techniques in machine translation has led to dramatic improvements in the quality of research systems in recent years.</S>

			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">In addition, the field of statistical machine translation israpidly progressing, and the quality of systems is getting better and better.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">An im portant factor in these improvements is definitely the availability of large amounts of data for training statistical models.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Yet the modeling, training, and search methods have also improved since the field of statistical machine translation was pioneered by IBM in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Brown et al. 1990; Brown et al. 1993; Berger etal.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">1994).</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">This article focuses on an important improvement, namely, the use of (gen eralized) phrases instead of just single words as the core elements of the statistical translation model.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">We describe in Section 2 the basics of our statistical translation model.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">We suggest the use of a log-linear model to incorporate the various knowledge sources into an overall translation system and to perform discriminative training of the free model parameters.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">This approach can be seen as a generalization of the originally suggested source–channel modeling framework for statistical machine translation.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">In Section 3, we describe the statistical alignment models used to obtain a word alignment and techniques for learning phrase translations from word alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">Here, the term phrase just refers to a consecutive sequence of words occurring in text and has to be distinguished from the use of the term in a linguistic sense.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">The learned bilingual phrases are not constrained by linguistic phrase boundaries.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">Compared to the word-based statistical translation models in Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">(1993), this model is based on a (statistical) phrase lexicon instead of a single-word-based lexicon.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">Looking at the results of the recent machine translation evaluations, this approach seems currently to give the best results, and an increasing number of researchers are working on different methods for learning phrase translation lexica for machine translation purposes (Marcu and Wong 2002; Venugopal, Vogel, and Waibel 2003; Tillmann 2003; Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003).</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">Our approach to learning a phrase translation lexicon works in two stages: In the first stage, we compute an alignment between words, and in the second stage, we extract the aligned phrase pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">In our machine translation system, we then use generalized versions of these phrases, called alignment templates, that also include the word alignment and use word classes instead of the words themselves.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "40">In Section 4, we describe the various components of the statistical translationmodel.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "41">The backbone of the translation model is the alignment template feature function, which requires that a translation of a new sentence be composed of a set of align ment templates that covers the source sentence and the produced translation.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "42">Other feature functions score the well-formedness of the produced target language sentence(i.e., language model feature functions), the number of produced words, or the or der of the alignment templates.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "43">Note that all components of our statistical machine translation model are purely data-driven and that there is no need for linguisticallyannotated corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "44">This is an important advantage compared to syntax-based trans lation models (Yamada and Knight 2001; Gildea 2003; Charniak, Knight, and Yamada 2003) that require a parser for source or target language.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "45">In Section 5, we describe in detail our search algorithm and discuss an efficient implementation.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "46">We use a dynamic-programming-based beam search algorithm that allows a trade-off between efficiency and quality.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "47">We also discuss the use of heuristic functions to reduce the number of search errors for a fixed beam size.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "48">In Section 6, we describe various results obtained on different tasks.</S>

			<S sid ="54" ssid = "1">We are given a source (French) sentence f = f J = f1 , ...</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "2">, fj , ...</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "3">, fJ , which is to be trans lated into a target (English) sentence e = eI = e1 , ...</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "4">, ei , ...</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "5">, eI . Among all possible target sentences, we will choose the sentence with the highest probability:2 ˆeI = argmax {Pr(eI | f J )} (1) 1 1 1 I 1 The argmax operation denotes the search problem, that is, the generation of the output sentence in the target language.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "6">As an alternative to the often used source–channel approach (Brown et al. 1993), we directly model the posterior probability Pr(eI| f J ) (Och and Ney 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "7">An es pecially well-founded framework for doing this is the maximum-entropy framework(Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra 1996).</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "8">In this framework, we have a set of M fea ture functions hm (eI , f J ), m = 1, ...</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "9">, M. For each feature function, there exists a model 1 1 2 The notational convention employed in this article is as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "10">We use the symbol Pr(·) to denote.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "11">general probability distributions with (nearly) no specific assumptions.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "12">In contrast, for model-based probability distributions, we use the generic symbol p(·).</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "13">419 parameter λm , m = 1, ...</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "14">, M. The direct translation probability is given by Pr(eI | f J ) = p M (eI | f J ) (2) 1 1 λ1 1 1 exp[ M λm hm (eI , f J )] m=1 1 1 M I J (3) e· I exp[ m=1 λm hm (e·1 , f1 )] This approach has been suggested by Papineni, Roukos, and Ward (1997, 1998) for a natural language understanding task.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "15">We obtain the following decision rule: ˆeI = argmax Pr(eI | f J ) 1 1 1 I 1 M ) = argmax λm hm (eI , f J ) 1 1 I m=1 Hence, the time-consuming renormalization in equation (3) is not needed in search.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "16">The overall architecture of the log-linear modeling approach is summarized in Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "17">A standard criterion on a parallel training corpus consisting of S sentence pairs {(fs , es ): s = 1, ...</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "18">, S} for log-linear models is the maximum class posterior probability criterion, which can be derived from the maximum-entropy principle: 1 = argmax M 1 S s=1 ) log pλM (es | fs ) (4) This corresponds to maximizing the equivocation or maximizing the likelihood of the direct-translation model.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "19">This direct optimization of the posterior probability in Bayes’ decision rule is referred to as discriminative training (Ney 1995) because we directly take into account the overlap in the probability distributions.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "20">The optimization problem under this criterion has very nice properties: There is one unique global optimum, and there are algorithms (e.g. gradient descent) that are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "21">Yet the ultimate goal is to obtain good translation quality on unseen test data.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "22">An alternative training criterion therefore directly optimizes translation quality as measured by an automatic evaluation criterion (Och 2003).Typically, the translation probability Pr(eI | f J ) is decomposed via additional hid 1 1 den variables.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "23">To include these dependencies in our log-linear model, we extend the feature functions to include the dependence on the additional hidden variable.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "24">Using for example the alignment aJ as hidden variable, we obtain M feature functions of the form hm (eI , f J , aJ ), m = 1, ...</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "25">, M and the following model: 1 1 1 exp M λm hm (eI , f J , aJ ) Pr(eI , aJ | f J ) = m=1 1 1 1 1 1 1 M I J J e· I · J exp λm hm (e·1 , f , a· ) 1 ,a 1 m=1 1 1 Obviously, we can perform the same step for translation models with an even richer set of hidden variables than only the alignment aJ .</S>

			<S sid ="79" ssid = "1">In this section, we describe methods for learning the single-word and phrase-based translation lexica that are the basis of the machine translation system described in 420 Section 4.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "2">First, we introduce the basic concepts of statistical alignment models, which are used to learn word alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "3">Then, we describe how these alignments can be used to learn bilingual phrasal translations.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "4">3.1 Statistical Alignment Models.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "5">In (statistical) alignment models Pr(f J , aJ | eI ), a “hidden” alignment a = aJis intro 1 1 1 1 duced that describes a mapping from a source position j to a target position aj . The relationship between the translation model and the alignment model is given by Pr(f J | eI ) = Pr(f J , aJ | eI ) (5) 1 1 1 1 1 J 1 The alignment aJ may contain alignments aj = 0 with the “empty” word e0 to account for source words that are not aligned with any target word.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "6">In general, the statistical model depends on a set of unknown parameters θ that is learned from training data.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "7">To express the dependence of the model on the parameter set, we use the following notation: Pr(f J , aJ | eI ) = pθ (f J , aJ | eI ) (6) 1 1 1 1 1 1 A detailed description of different specific statistical alignment models can be found in Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "8">(1993) and Och and Ney (2003).</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "9">Here, we use the hidden Markov model (HMM) alignment model (Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann 1996) and Model 4 of Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "10">(1993) to compute the word alignment for the parallel training corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "11">To train the unknown parameters θ, we are given a parallel training corpus consisting of S sentence pairs {(fs , es ): s = 1, ...</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "12">, S}.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "13">For each sentence pair (fs , es ), the alignment variable is denoted by a = aJ . The unknown parameters θ are determined by maximizing the likelihood on the parallel training corpus: θˆ = argmax θ S I n s=1 a l) pθ (fs , a | es ) (7) This optimization can be performed using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977).</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "14">For a given sentence pair there are a large number of alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "15">The alignment ˆaJ that has the highest probability (under a certain model) is also called the Viterbi alignment (of that model): ˆaJ = argmax p ˆ(f J , aJ | eI ) (8) 1 θ 1 1 1 J 1 A detailed comparison of the quality of these Viterbi alignments for various statistical alignment models compared to human-made word alignments can be found in Och and Ney (2003).</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "16">3.2 Symmetrization.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "17">The baseline alignment model does not allow a source word to be aligned with two or more target words.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "18">Therefore, lexical correspondences like the German compound word Zahnarzttermin for dentist’s appointment cause problems because a single source word must be mapped onto two or more target words.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "19">Therefore, the resulting Viterbi alignment of the standard alignment models has a systematic loss in recall.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "20">Here, we 421 Figure 2 Example of a (symmetrized) word alignment (Verbmobil task).</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "21">describe various methods for performing a symmetrization of our directed statistical alignment models by applying a heuristic postprocessing step that combines the alignments in both translation directions (source to target, target to source).</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "22">Figure 2 shows an example of a symmetrized alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "23">To solve this problem, we train in both translation directions.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "24">For each sentence pair, we compute two Viterbi alignments aJ and bI . Let A1 = {(aj , j) | aj &gt; 0} and A2 = {(i, bi ) | bi &gt; 0} denote the sets of alignments in the two Viterbi alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "25">To increase the quality of the alignments, we can combine (symmetrize) A1 and A2 into one alignment matrix A using one of the following combination methods: • Intersection: A = A1 ∩ A2 . • Union: A = A1 ∪ A2 . • Refined method: In a first step, the intersection A = A1 ∩ A2 is determined.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "26">The elements of this intersection result from both Viterbi alignments and are therefore very reliable.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "27">Then, we extend the alignment A iteratively by adding alignments (i, j) occurring only in the 422 alignment A1 or in the alignment A2 if neither fj nor ei have an alignment in A, or if the following conditions both hold: • The alignment (i, j) has a horizontal neighbor (i − 1, j), (i + 1, j) or a vertical neighbor (i, j − 1), (i, j + 1) that is already in A. • The set A ∪ {(i, j)} does not contain alignments with both horizontal and vertical neighbors.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "28">Obviously, the intersection yields an alignment consisting of only one-to-one alignments with a higher precision and a lower recall.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "29">The union yields a higher recall and a lower precision of the combined alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "30">The refined alignment method is often able to improve precision and recall compared to the nonsymmetrized alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "31">Whether a higher precision or a higher recall is preferred depends on the final application of the word alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "32">For the purpose of statistical MT, it seems that a higher recall is more important.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "33">Therefore, we use the union or the refined combination method to obtain a symmetrized alignment matrix.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "34">The resulting symmetrized alignments are then used to train single-word-based translation lexica p(e | f ) by computing relative frequencies using the count N(e, f ) of how many times e and f are aligned divided by the count N(f ) of how many times the word f occurs: p(e | f ) = N(e, f ) N(f ) 3.3 Bilingual Contiguous Phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "35">In this section, we present a method for learning relationships between whole phrases of m source language words and n target language words.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "36">This algorithm, whichwill be called phrase-extract, takes as input a general word alignment matrix (Sec tion 3.2).</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "37">The output is a set of bilingual phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "38">In the following, we describe the criterion that defines the set of phrases that is consistent with the word alignment matrix: BP(f J , eI , A) = f j+m , ei+n 1 1 j i : ∀(i·, j·) ∈ A : j ≤ j· ≤ j + m ↔ i ≤ i· ≤ i + n (9) ∧∃(i·, j·) ∈ A : j ≤ j· ≤ j + m ∧ i ≤ i· ≤ i + n Hence, the set of all bilingual phrases that are consistent with the alignment is constituted by all bilingual phrase pairs in which all words within the source language phrase are aligned only with the words of the target language phrase and the words of the target language phrase are aligned only with the words of the source language phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "39">Note that we require that at least one word in the source language phrase be aligned with at least one word of the target language phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "40">As a result there are no empty source or target language phrases that would correspond to the “empty word” of the word-based statistical alignment models.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "41">These phrases can be computed straightforwardly by enumerating all possible phrases in one language and checking whether the aligned words in the other language are consecutive, with the possible exception of words that are not aligned at all.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "42">Figure 3 gives the algorithm phrase-extract that computes the phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "43">The algorithm takes into account possibly unaligned words at the boundaries of the source or target language phrases.</S>

			<S sid ="125" ssid = "47">If a consecutive phrase in one language is translated into two or three nonconsecutive phrases in the other language, there is no corresponding bilingual phrase pair learned by this approach.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "48">In principle, this approach to learning phrases from a word-aligned corpus could be extended straightforwardly to handle nonconsecutive phrases in source and target language as well.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "49">Informal experiments have shown that allowing for nonconsecutive phrases significantly increases the number of extracted phrases and especially increases the percentage of wrong phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "50">Therefore, we consider only consecutive phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "51">3.4 Alignment Templates.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "52">In the following, we add generalization capability to the bilingual phrase lexicon by replacing words with word classes and also by storing the alignment information for each phrase pair.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "53">These generalized and alignment-annotated phrase pairs are called alignment templates.</S>

			<S sid ="135" ssid = "57">that describes the alignment A˜ between a source class sequence FJ· and a target class sequence EI· . If each word corresponds to one class, an alignment template corresponds to a bilingual phrase together with an alignment within this phrase.</S>

			<S sid ="137" ssid = "59">The alignment A˜ is represented as a matrix with J· · (I· + 1) binary elements.</S>
			<S sid ="138" ssid = "60">A matrix element with value 1 means that the words at the corresponding positions are aligned, and the value 0 means that the words are not aligned.</S>
			<S sid ="139" ssid = "61">If a source word is not aligned with a target word, then it is aligned with the empty word e0 , which is at the imaginary position i = 0.</S>
			<S sid ="140" ssid = "62">The classes used in FJ· and EI· are automatically trained bilingual classes using the method described in Och (1999) and constitute a partition of the vocabulary of source and target language.</S>
			<S sid ="141" ssid = "63">In general, we are not limited to disjoint classes as long as each specific instance of a word is disambiguated, that is, uniquely belongs to a specific class.</S>
			<S sid ="142" ssid = "64">In the following, we use the class function C to map words to their classes.</S>
			<S sid ="143" ssid = "65">Hence, it would be possible to employ parts-of-speech or semantic categories instead of the automatically trained word classes used here.</S>
			<S sid ="144" ssid = "66">The use of classes instead of the words themselves has the advantage of better generalization.</S>
			<S sid ="145" ssid = "67">For example, if there exist classes in source and target language that contain town names, it is possible that an alignment template learned using a specific town name can be generalized to other town names.</S>

			<S sid ="158" ssid = "1">To describe our translation model based on the alignment templates described in the previous section in a formal way, we first decompose both the source sentence f J and the target sentence eI into a sequence of phrases (k = 1, ...</S>

			<S sid ="164" ssid = "7">Hence, as part of the overall search process (Section 5), we also search for the optimal segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "8">To allow possible reordering of phrases, we introduce an alignment on the phrase level πK between the source phrases ˜f K and the target phrases ˜eK . Hence, πK is a 1 1 1 1 permutation of the phrase positions 1, ...</S>

			<S sid ="168" ssid = "11">Hence, all knowl edge sources are described as feature functions that include the given source language string f J , the target language string eI , and the above-stated hidden variables.</S>

			<S sid ="170" ssid = "13">First, the source sentence words f J are grouped into phrases ˜f K . For each phrase ˜f an 1 1 alignment template z is chosen and the sequence of chosen alignment templates is reordered (according to πK ).</S>

			<S sid ="175" ssid = "18">4.1.1 Alignment Template Selection.</S>
			<S sid ="176" ssid = "19">To score the use of an alignment template, we use the probability p(z | ˜f ) defined in Section 3.</S>
			<S sid ="177" ssid = "20">We establish a corresponding feature function by multiplying the probability of all used alignment templates and taking the logarithm: K hAT(eI , f J , πK , zK ) = log n p(zk | f jπk ) (13) 1 1 1 1 k=1 jπk −1 +1 Here, jπk −1 + 1 is the position of the first word of alignment template zk in the source language sentence and jπk is the position of the last word of that alignment template.</S>
			<S sid ="178" ssid = "21">Note that this feature function requires that a translation of a new sentence be composed of a set of alignment templates that covers both the source sentence and the produced translation.</S>
			<S sid ="179" ssid = "22">There is no notion of “empty phrase” that corresponds to the “empty word” in word-based statistical alignment models.</S>
			<S sid ="180" ssid = "23">The alignment on the phrase level is actually a permutation, and no insertions or deletions are allowed.</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "24">4.1.2 Word Selection.</S>
			<S sid ="182" ssid = "25">For scoring the use of target language words, we use a lexicon probability p(e | f ), which is estimated using relative frequencies as described in Sec tion 3.2.</S>
			<S sid ="183" ssid = "26">The target word e depends on the aligned source words.</S>
			<S sid ="184" ssid = "27">If we denote the resulting word alignment matrix by A := AπK K and the predicted word class for word 1 ,z1 ei by Ei , then the feature function hWRD is defined as follows: I hWRD(eI , f J , πK , zK ) = log n p(ei | {fj | (i, j) ∈ A}, Ei ) (14) 1 1 1 1 i=1 For p(ei | {fj | (i, j) ∈ A}) we use a uniform mixture of a single-word model p(e | f ), which is constrained to predict only words that are in the predicted word class Ei : j|(i,j)∈A} p(ei | fj ) p(ei | {fj | (i, j) ∈ A}, Ei ) = { |{j | (i, j) ∈ A}| · δ(C(ei ), Ei ) A disadvantage of this model is that the word order is ignored in the translation model.</S>
			<S sid ="185" ssid = "28">The translations the day after tomorrow or after the day tomorrow for the German word u¨ bermorgen receive an identical probability.</S>
			<S sid ="186" ssid = "29">Yet the first one should obtain a significantly higher probability.</S>
			<S sid ="187" ssid = "30">Hence, we also include a dependence on the word positions in the lexicon model p(e | f , i, j): p(ei | fj , i−1 i· =1 [(i·, j) ∈ A], j−1 j· =1 [(i, j·) ∈ A]) (15) Here, [(i·, j) ∈ A] is 1 if (i·, j) ∈ A and 0 otherwise.</S>
			<S sid ="188" ssid = "31">As a result, the word ei depends not only on the aligned French word fj , but also on the number of preceding French words aligned with ei and on the number of the preceding English words aligned with fj . This model distinguishes the positions within a phrasal translation.</S>
			<S sid ="189" ssid = "32">The number of parameters of p(e | f , i, j) is significantly higher than that of p(e | f ) alone.</S>
			<S sid ="190" ssid = "33">Hence, there is a data estimation problem especially for words that rarely occur.</S>
			<S sid ="191" ssid = "34">Therefore, we linearly interpolate the models p(e | f ) and p(e | f , i, j).</S>
			<S sid ="192" ssid = "35">4.1.3 Phrase Alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="193" ssid = "36">The phrase alignment feature simply takes into account that very often a monotone alignment is a correct alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="194" ssid = "37">Hence, the feature function hAL measures the “amount of nonmonotonicity” by summing over the distance (in the 429 source language) of alignment templates that are consecutive in the target language: K+1 hAL(eI , f J , πK , zK ) = |jπ 1 − j | (16) 1 1 1 1 k − k=1 πk−1 Here, jπ0 is defined to equal 0 and jπK+1 −1 is defined to equal J. The above-stated sum includes k = K + 1 to include the distance from the end position of the last phrase to the end of sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="195" ssid = "38">The sequence of K = 6 alignment templates in Figure 5 corresponds to the following sum of seven jump distances: 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 6.</S>
			<S sid ="196" ssid = "39">4.1.4 Language Model Features.</S>
			<S sid ="197" ssid = "40">As a default language model feature, we use a standard backing-off word-based trigram language model (Ney, Generet, and Wessel 1995): I+1 hLM(eI , f J , πK , zK ) = log n p(ei | ei 2 , e ) (17) 1 1 1 1 i=1 − i−1 In addition, we use a 5-gram class-based language model: I+1 hCLM(eI , f J , πK , zK ) = log n p(C(ei ) | C(ei 4 ), ...</S>
			<S sid ="198" ssid = "41">, C(e )) (18) 1 1 1 1 i=1 − i−1 The use of the language model feature in equation (18) helps take long-range dependencies better into account.</S>
			<S sid ="199" ssid = "42">4.1.5 Word Penalty.</S>
			<S sid ="200" ssid = "43">To improve the scoring for different target sentence lengths, we also use as a feature the number of produced target language words (i.e., the length of the produced target language sentence): hWP(eI , f J , πK , zK ) = I (19) 1 1 1 1 Without this feature, we typically observe that the produced sentences tend to be too short.</S>
			<S sid ="201" ssid = "44">4.1.6 Conventional Lexicon.</S>
			<S sid ="202" ssid = "45">We also use a feature that counts how many entries of a conventional lexicon co-occur in the given sentence pair.</S>
			<S sid ="203" ssid = "46">Therefore, the weight for the provided conventional dictionary can be learned: hLEX(eI , f J , πK , zK ) = #CO-OCCURRENCES (LEX, eI , f J ) (20) 1 1 1 1 1 1 The intuition is that the conventional dictionary LEX is more reliable than the automatically trained lexicon and therefore should get a larger weight.</S>
			<S sid ="204" ssid = "47">4.1.7 Additional Features.</S>
			<S sid ="205" ssid = "48">A major advantage of the log-linear modeling approach used is that we can add numerous features that deal with specific problems of the baseline statistical MT system.</S>
			<S sid ="206" ssid = "49">Here, we will restrict ourselves to the described set of features.</S>
			<S sid ="207" ssid = "50">Yet we could use grammatical features that relate certain grammatical dependencies of source and target language.</S>
			<S sid ="208" ssid = "51">For example, using a function k(·) that counts how many arguments the main verb of a sentence has in the source or target sentence, we can define the following feature, which has a nonzero value if the verb in each of the two sentences has the same number of arguments: h(f J , eI , πK , zK ) = δ(k(f J ), k(eI )) (21) 1 1 1 1 1 1 In the same way, we can introduce semantic features or pragmatic features such as the dialogue act classification.</S>
			<S sid ="209" ssid = "52">430 4.2 Training.</S>
			<S sid ="210" ssid = "53">For the three different tasks on which we report results, we use two different training approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="211" ssid = "54">For the Verbmobil task, we train the model parameters λM according to the maximum class posterior probability criterion (equation (4)).</S>
			<S sid ="212" ssid = "55">For the French– English Hansards task and the Chinese–English NIST task, we simply tune the modelparameters by coordinate descent on held-out data with respect to the automatic eval uation metric employed, using as a starting point the model parameters obtained on the Verbmobil task.</S>
			<S sid ="213" ssid = "56">Note that this tuning depends on the starting point of the model parameters and is not guaranteed to converge to the global optimum on the trainingdata.</S>
			<S sid ="214" ssid = "57">As a result, this approach is limited to a very small number of model parame ters.</S>
			<S sid ="215" ssid = "58">An efficient algorithm for performing this tuning for a larger number of model parameters can be found in Och (2003).</S>
			<S sid ="216" ssid = "59">A standard approach to training the log-linear model parameters of the maximum class posterior probability criterion is the GIS (Generalized Iterative Scaling) algorithm(Darroch and Ratcliff 1972).</S>
			<S sid ="217" ssid = "60">To apply this algorithm, we have to solve various practi cal problems.</S>
			<S sid ="218" ssid = "61">The renormalization needed in equation (3) requires a sum over manypossible sentences, for which we do not know of an efficient algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="219" ssid = "62">Hence, we ap proximate this sum by extracting a large set of highly probable sentences as a sample from the space of all possible sentences (n-best approximation).</S>
			<S sid ="220" ssid = "63">The set of considered sentences is computed by means of an appropriately extended version of the search algorithm described in Section 5.</S>
			<S sid ="221" ssid = "64">Using an n-best approximation, we might face the problem that the parameters trained with the GIS algorithm yield worse translation results even on the training corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="222" ssid = "65">This can happen because with the modified model scaling factors, the n-best list can change significantly and can include sentences that have not been taken into account in training.</S>
			<S sid ="223" ssid = "66">Using these sentences, the new model parameters might perform worse than the old model parameters.</S>
			<S sid ="224" ssid = "67">To avoid this problem, we proceed as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="225" ssid = "68">In a first step, we perform a search, compute an n-best list, and use this n-best list to train the model parameters.</S>
			<S sid ="226" ssid = "69">Second, we use the new model parameters in a new search and compute a new n-best list, which is combined with the existing n-best list.</S>
			<S sid ="227" ssid = "70">Third, using this extended n-best list, new model parameters are computed.</S>
			<S sid ="228" ssid = "71">This process is iterated until the resulting n-best list does not change.</S>
			<S sid ="229" ssid = "72">In this algorithm, convergence is guaranteed, as in the limit the n-best list will contain all possible translations.</S>
			<S sid ="230" ssid = "73">In practice, the algorithm converges after five to seven iterations.</S>
			<S sid ="231" ssid = "74">In our experiments this final n-best list contains about 500–1000 alternative translations.</S>
			<S sid ="232" ssid = "75">We might have the problem that none of the given reference translations is part of the n-best list because the n-best list is too small or because the search algorithmperforms pruning which in principle limits the possible translations that can be pro duced given a certain input sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="233" ssid = "76">To solve this problem, we define as reference translation for maximum-entropy training each sentence that has the minimal number of word errors with respect to any of the reference translations in the n-best list.</S>
			<S sid ="234" ssid = "77">More details of the training procedure can be found in Och and Ney (2002).</S>

			<S sid ="235" ssid = "1">In this section, we describe an efficient search architecture for the alignment template model.</S>
			<S sid ="236" ssid = "2">5.1 General Concept.</S>
			<S sid ="237" ssid = "3">In general, the search problem for statistical MT even using only Model 1 of Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="238" ssid = "4">(1993) is NP-complete (Knight 1999).</S>
			<S sid ="239" ssid = "5">Therefore, we cannot expect to develop 431 efficient search algorithms that are guaranteed to solve the problem without search errors.</S>
			<S sid ="240" ssid = "6">Yet for practical applications it is acceptable to commit some search errors (Section 6.1.2).</S>
			<S sid ="241" ssid = "7">Hence, the art of developing a search algorithm lies in finding suitable approximations and heuristics that allow an efficient search without committing too many search errors.</S>
			<S sid ="242" ssid = "8">In the development of the search algorithm described in this section, our main aim is that the search algorithm should be efficient.</S>
			<S sid ="243" ssid = "9">It should be possible to translate a sentence of reasonable length within a few seconds of computing time.</S>
			<S sid ="244" ssid = "10">We accept that the search algorithm sometimes results in search errors, as long as the impact on translation quality is minor.</S>
			<S sid ="245" ssid = "11">Yet it should be possible to reduce the number of search errors by increasing computing time.</S>
			<S sid ="246" ssid = "12">In the limit, it should be possible to search without search errors.</S>
			<S sid ="247" ssid = "13">The search algorithm should not impose any principal limitations.</S>
			<S sid ="248" ssid = "14">We also expect that the search algorithm be able to scale up to very long sentences with an acceptable computing time.</S>
			<S sid ="249" ssid = "15">To meet these aims, it is necessary to have a mechanism that restricts the search effort.</S>
			<S sid ="250" ssid = "16">We accomplish such a restriction by searching in a breadth-first manner with pruning: beam search.</S>
			<S sid ="251" ssid = "17">In pruning, we constrain the set of considered translation candidates (the “beam”) only to the promising ones.</S>
			<S sid ="252" ssid = "18">We compare in beam search those hypotheses that cover different parts of the input sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="253" ssid = "19">This makes the comparison of the probabilities problematic.</S>
			<S sid ="254" ssid = "20">Therefore, we integrate an admissible estimation of the remaining probabilities to arrive at a complete translation (Section 5.6) Many of the other search approaches suggested in the literature do not meet the described aims: • Neither optimal A* search (Och, Ueffing, and Ney 2001) nor optimal integer programming (Germann et al. 2001) for statistical MT allows efficient search for long sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="255" ssid = "21">• Greedy search algorithms (Wang 1998; Germann et al. 2001) typically commit severe search errors (Germann et al. 2001).</S>
			<S sid ="256" ssid = "22">• Other approaches to solving the search problem obtain polynomial time algorithms by assuming monotone alignments (Tillmann et al. 1997) or imposing a simplified recombination structure (Nießen et al. 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="257" ssid = "23">Others make simplifying assumptions about the search space (Garc´ıa-Varea, Casacuberta, and Ney 1998; Garc´ıa-Varea et al. 2001), as does the original IBM stack search decoder (Berger et al. 1994).</S>
			<S sid ="258" ssid = "24">All these simplifications ultimately make the search problem simpler but introduce fundamental search errors.</S>
			<S sid ="259" ssid = "25">In the following, we describe our search algorithm based on the concept of beam search, which allows a trade-off between efficiency and quality by adjusting the size of the beam.</S>
			<S sid ="260" ssid = "26">The search algorithm can be easily adapted to other phrase-based translation models.</S>
			<S sid ="261" ssid = "27">For single-word-based search in MT, a similar algorithm has been described in Tillmann and Ney (2003).</S>
			<S sid ="262" ssid = "28">5.2 Search Problem.</S>
			<S sid ="263" ssid = "29">Putting everything together and performing search in maximum approximation, we obtain the following decision rule: ˆeI = argmax M ) λm · hm (eI , f J , πK , zK ) (22) 1 eI K K 1 1 1 1 1 ,π1 ,z1 m=1 432 Using the four feature functions AT, AL, WRD, and LM, we obtain the following decision rule:3 ˆeI = argmax (23) eI K K 1 ,π1 ,z1 I i=1 (λLM log p(ei | ei−2 , ei−1 )+ λWRD log p(ei | {fj | (i, j) ∈ A}, Ei )) (24) K jπk + k=1 λAT log p(zk | fjπ k−1 +1 )+ λAL · |jπk − jπk−1 +1 | (25) +λAL · (J − jπK )+ λLM log p(EOS | eI−1 , eI ) (26) Here, we have grouped the contributions of the various feature functions into those for each word (from LM and WRD, expression (24)), those for every alignment template (from AT and AL, expression (25)), and those for the end of sentence (expression (26)), which includes a term log p(EOS | eI−1 , eI ) for the end-of-sentence language model probability.To extend this decision rule for the word penalty (WP) feature function, we sim ply obtain an additional term λWP for each word.</S>
			<S sid ="264" ssid = "30">The class-based 5-gram language model (CLM) can be included like the trigram language model.</S>
			<S sid ="265" ssid = "31">Note that all these feature functions decompose nicely into contributions for each produced target language word or for each covered source language word.</S>
			<S sid ="266" ssid = "32">This makes it possible to develop an efficient dynamic programming search algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="267" ssid = "33">Not all feature functions have this nice property: For the conventional lexicon feature function (LEX), we obtain an additional term in our decision rule which depends on the full sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="268" ssid = "34">Therefore, this feature function will not be integrated in the dynamic programming search but instead will be used to rerank the set of candidate translations produced by the search.</S>
			<S sid ="269" ssid = "35">5.3 Structure of Search Space.</S>
			<S sid ="270" ssid = "36">We have to structure the search space in a suitable way to search efficiently.</S>
			<S sid ="271" ssid = "37">In our search algorithm, we generate search hypotheses that correspond to prefixes of target language sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="272" ssid = "38">Each hypothesis is the translation of a part of the source languagesentence.</S>
			<S sid ="273" ssid = "39">A hypothesis is extended by appending one target word.</S>
			<S sid ="274" ssid = "40">The set of all hy potheses can be structured as a graph with a source node representing the sentencestart, goal nodes representing complete translations, and intermediate nodes repre senting partial translations.</S>
			<S sid ="275" ssid = "41">There is a directed edge between hypotheses n1 and n2 if the hypothesis n2 is obtained by appending one word to hypothesis n1 . Each edge has associated costs resulting from the contributions of all feature functions.</S>
			<S sid ="276" ssid = "42">Finally, our search problem can be reformulated as finding the optimal path through this graph.In the first step, we determine the set of all source phrases in ˜f for which an appli cable alignment template exists.</S>
			<S sid ="277" ssid = "43">Every possible application of an alignment template z = (FJ· , EI· , A˜ ) to a subsequence f j+J· −1 of the source sentence is called an alignment 1 1 j template instantiation Z = (z, j).</S>
			<S sid ="278" ssid = "44">Hence, the set of all alignment template instantiations for the source sentence f J is Z = (z, j) | z = (FJ , EI· , A˜ ) j : p(z f j+J· −1 ) &gt; 0 (27) 1 1 ∧∃ | j 3 Note that here some of the simplifying notation of Section 4 has been used..</S>
			<S sid ="279" ssid = "45">433 If the source sentence contains words that have not been seen in the training data, we introduce a new alignment template that performs a one-to-one translation of each of these words by itself.</S>
			<S sid ="280" ssid = "46">In the second step, we determine a set of probable target language words for each target word position in the alignment template instantiation.</S>
			<S sid ="281" ssid = "47">Only these words are then hypothesized in the search.</S>
			<S sid ="282" ssid = "48">We call this selection of highly probable words observation pruning (Tillmann and Ney 2000).</S>
			<S sid ="283" ssid = "49">As a criterion for a word e at position i in the alignment template instantiation, we use δ(Ei , C(e)) · J· j=0 A˜ (i, j) A˜ (i·, j) · p(e | fj ) (28) In our experiments, we hypothesize only the five best-scoring words.</S>
			<S sid ="284" ssid = "50">A decision is a triple d = (Z, e, l) consisting of an alignment template instantiation Z, the generated word e, and the index l of the generated word in Z. A hypothesis n corresponds to a valid sequence of decisions di . The possible decisions are as follows: 1.</S>

			<S sid ="290" ssid = "56">The resulting decision score corresponds to the contribution of the LM and the WRD features (expression (24)) for the produced word and the contribution of AL and AT features (expression (25)) for the started alignment template.</S>

			<S sid ="350" ssid = "13">To improve the comparability of search hypotheses, we introduce heuristic functions.</S>
			<S sid ="351" ssid = "14">A heuristic function estimates the probabilities of reaching the goal node from a certain 436 search node.</S>
			<S sid ="352" ssid = "15">An admissible heuristic function is always an optimistic estimate; that is, for each search node, the product of edge probabilities of reaching a goal node is always equal to or smaller than the estimated probability.</S>
			<S sid ="353" ssid = "16">For an A*-based search algorithm, a good heuristic function is crucial to being able to translate long sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="354" ssid = "17">For a beam search algorithm, the heuristic function has a different motivation.</S>
			<S sid ="355" ssid = "18">It is used to improve the scoring of search hypotheses.</S>
			<S sid ="356" ssid = "19">The goal is to make the probabilities of all hypotheses more comparable, in order to minimize the chance that the hypothesis leading to the optimal translation is pruned away.</S>
			<S sid ="357" ssid = "20">Heuristic functions for search in statistical MT have been used in Wang and Waibel (1997) and Och, Ueffing, and Ney (2001).</S>
			<S sid ="358" ssid = "21">Wang and Waibel (1997) have described a simple heuristic function for Model 2 of Brown et al.</S>

			<S sid ="361" ssid = "24">(1993) and an almost-admissible heuristic function that is empirically obtained.</S>
			<S sid ="362" ssid = "25">We have to keep in mind that a heuristic function is helpful only if the overhead introduced in computing the heuristic function is more than compensated for by the gain obtained through a better pruning of search hypotheses.</S>
			<S sid ="363" ssid = "26">The heuristic functions described in the following are designed such that their computation can be performed efficiently.</S>
			<S sid ="364" ssid = "27">The basic idea for developing a heuristic function for an alignment model is that all source sentence positions that have not been covered so far still have to be translated to complete the sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="365" ssid = "28">If we have an estimation rX(j) of the optimal score for translating position j, then the value of the heuristic function RX(n) for a node n can be inferred by summing over the contribution for every position j that is not in the coverage vector c(n) (here X denotes different possibilities to choose the heuristic function): RX(n) = j∓∈c(n) rX(j) (29) The situation in the case of the alignment template approach is more complicated, as not every word is translated alone, but typically the words are translated in context.</S>
			<S sid ="366" ssid = "29">Therefore, the basic quantity for the heuristic function in the case of the alignment template approach is a function r(Z) that assigns to every alignment template in- stantiation Z a maximal probability.</S>
			<S sid ="367" ssid = "30">Using r(Z), we can induce a position-dependent heuristic function r(j): r(j) := max Z:j(Z)≤j≤j(Z)+J(Z)−1 r(Z)/J(Z) (30) Here, J(Z) denotes the number of source language words produced by the alignment template instantiation Z and j(Z) denotes the position of the first source language word.</S>
			<S sid ="368" ssid = "31">It can be easily shown that if r(Z) is admissible, then r(j) is also admissible.</S>
			<S sid ="369" ssid = "32">We have to show that for all nonoverlapping sequences ZK the following holds: K k=1 r(Zk ) ≤ j∈c(ZK ) r(j) (31) Here, c(ZK ) denotes the set of all positions covered by the sequence of alignment templates ZK .

			<S sid ="371" ssid = "34">The simplest realization of a heuristic function r(Z) takes into account only the prior probability of an alignment template instantiation: RAT(Z = (z, j)) = λAT · log p(z | fj,j+J(z) The lexicon model can be integrated as follows: −1 ) (35) RWRD(Z) = λWRD · j(Z)+J(Z)−1 j· =j(Z) max log p(e fj· ) (36) e The language model can be incorporated by considering that for each target word there exists an optimal language model probability: pL(e) = max p(e e·, e··) (37) e· ,e·· Here, we assume a trigram language model.</S>
			<S sid ="372" ssid = "35">In general, it is necessary to maximize over all possible different language model histories.</S>
			<S sid ="373" ssid = "36">We can also combine the language model and the lexicon model into one heuristic function: RWRD+LM(Z) = j(Z)+J(Z)−1 j· =j(Z) max λWRD log(p(e | fj· )) + λLM log(pL(e)) (38) To include the phrase alignment probability in the heuristic function, we compute the minimum sum of all jump widths that is needed to complete the translation.</S>

			<S sid ="381" ssid = "44">We use a training corpus, which is used to train the alignment template model and the language models, a development corpus, which is used to estimate the model scaling factors, and a test corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="382" ssid = "45">On average, 3.32 reference translations for the development corpus and 5.14 reference translations for the test corpus are used.</S>
			<S sid ="383" ssid = "46">A standard vocabulary had been defined for the various speech recognizers usedin Verbmobil.</S>
			<S sid ="384" ssid = "47">However, not all words of this vocabulary were observed in the train ing corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="385" ssid = "48">Therefore, the translation vocabulary was extended semiautomatically byadding about 13,000 German–English entries from an online bilingual lexicon avail able on the Web.</S>
			<S sid ="386" ssid = "49">The resulting lexicon contained not only word-word entries, but also multi-word translations, especially for the large number of German compound words.</S>
			<S sid ="387" ssid = "50">To counteract the sparseness of the training data, a couple of straightforward rule-based preprocessing steps were applied before any other type of processing: • normalization of • numbers • time and date phrases • spelling (e.g., don’t → do not) • splitting of German compound words.</S>
			<S sid ="388" ssid = "51">439 So far, in machine translation research there is no generally accepted criterion for the evaluation of experimental results.</S>
			<S sid ="389" ssid = "52">Therefore, we use various criteria.</S>
			<S sid ="390" ssid = "53">In the following experiments, we use: • WER (word error rate)/mWER (multireference word error rate): The WER is computed as the minimum number of substitution, insertion, and deletion operations that have to be performed to convert the generated sentence into the target sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="391" ssid = "54">In the case of the multireference word error rate for each test sentence, not just a single reference translation is used, as for the WER, but a whole set of reference translations.</S>
			<S sid ="392" ssid = "55">For each translation hypothesis, the edit distance to the most similar sentence is calculated (Nießen et al. 2000).</S>
			<S sid ="393" ssid = "56">• PER (position-independent WER): A shortcoming of the WER is the fact that it requires a perfect word order.</S>
			<S sid ="394" ssid = "57">An acceptable sentence can have a word order that is different from that of the target sentence, so the WER measure alone could be misleading.</S>
			<S sid ="395" ssid = "58">To overcome this problem, we introduce as an additional measure the position-independent word error rate.</S>
			<S sid ="396" ssid = "59">This measure compares the words in the two sentences, ignoring the word order.</S>
			<S sid ="397" ssid = "60">• BLEU (bilingual evalutation understudy) score: This score measures the precision of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams with respect to a whole set of reference translations, with a penalty for too-short sentences (Papineni et al. 2001).</S>
			<S sid ="398" ssid = "61">Unlike all other evaluation criteria used here, BLEU measures accuracy, that is, the opposite of error rate.</S>
			<S sid ="399" ssid = "62">Hence, the larger BLEU scores, the better.</S>
			<S sid ="400" ssid = "63">In the following, we analyze the effect of various system components: alignment template length, search pruning, and language model n-gram size.</S>
			<S sid ="401" ssid = "64">A systematic evaluation of the alignment template system comparing it with other translation approaches (e.g., rule-based) has been performed in the Verbmobil project and is described in Tessiore and von Hahn (2000).</S>
			<S sid ="402" ssid = "65">There, the alignment-template-based system achieved a significantly larger number of “approximately correct” translations than the competing translation systems (Ney, Och, and Vogel 2001).</S>

			<S sid ="404" ssid = "67">Table 3 shows the effect of constraining the maximum length of the alignment templates in the source language.</S>
			<S sid ="405" ssid = "68">Typically, it is necessary to restrict the alignment template length to keep memory requirements low.</S>

			<S sid ="474" ssid = "137">We use the LDC segmentation tool.5 For the English corpus, the following preprocessing steps are applied.</S>
			<S sid ="475" ssid = "138">First, the corpus is tokenized; it is then segmented into sentences, and all uppercase characters are converted to lowercase.</S>
			<S sid ="476" ssid = "139">As the final evaluation criterion does not distinguish case, it is not necessary to deal with the case information.</S>
			<S sid ="477" ssid = "140">Then, the preprocessed Chinese and English corpora are sentence aligned in which the lengths of the source and target sentences are significantly different.</S>
			<S sid ="478" ssid = "141">From the resulting corpus, we automatically replace translations.</S>
			<S sid ="479" ssid = "142">In addition, only sentences with less than 60 words in English and Chinese are used.</S>
			<S sid ="480" ssid = "143">To improve the translation of Chinese numbers, we use a categorization of Chinese number and date expressions.</S>

			<S sid ="504" ssid = "13">We have described the alignment template approach for statistical machine translation, which uses two different alignment levels: a phrase-level alignment between phrases and a word- level alignment between single words.</S>
			<S sid ="505" ssid = "14">As a result the context of words has a greater influence, and the changes in word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly.</S>
			<S sid ="506" ssid = "15">An advantage of this method is that machine translation is learned fully automatically through the use of a bilingual training corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="507" ssid = "16">We have shown that the presented approach is capable of achieving better translation results on various tasks compared to other statistical, example-based, or rule-based translation systems.</S>
