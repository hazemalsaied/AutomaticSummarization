Abstract


In statistical machine translation, cor- 
respondences  between  the  words  in 
the source and the target language are 
learned from bilingual corpora on the 
basis of so called alignment models. 
Existing statistical systems for MT of- 
ten treat different derivatives of the 
same lemma as if they were indepen- 
dent of each other.  In this paper we 
argue that a better exploitation of the 
bilingual training data can be achieved 
by explicitly taking into account the in- 
terdependencies of the different deriva- 
tives.   We do this along two direc- 
tions:  Usage of hierarchical lexicon 
models and the introduction of equiv- 
alence classes in order to ignore in- 
formation not relevant for the trans- 
lation task.  The improvement of the 
translation results is demonstrated on a 
German-English corpus.


1   Introduction

The statistical approach to machine translation 
has become widely accepted in the last few years. 
It has been successfully applied to realistic tasks 
in various national and international research pro- 
grams. However in many applications only small 
amounts of bilingual training data are available 
for the desired domain and language pair, and it 
is highly desirable to avoid at least parts of the 
costly data collection process.
  

Some recent publications have dealt with the 
problem of translation with scarce resources. 
(Brown et al., 1994) describe the use of dictio- 
naries. (Al-Onaizan et al., 2000) report on an ex- 
periment of Tetun-to-English translation by dif- 
ferent groups, including one using statistical ma- 
chine translation.   They assume the absence of 
linguistic knowledge sources such as morphologi- 
cal analyzers and dictionaries. Nevertheless, they 
found that human mind is very well capable of 
deriving dependencies such as morphology, cog- 
nates, proper names, spelling variations etc., and 
that this capability was finally at the basis of the 
better results produced by humans compared to 
corpus based machine translation. The additional 
information results from complex reasoning and it 
is not directly accessible from the full word form 
representation of the data.

  In  this  paper,  we  take  a  different  point  of 
view: Even if full bilingual training data is scarce, 
monolingual knowledge sources like morpholog- 
ical analyzers and data for training the target lan- 
guage model as well as conventional dictionar- 
ies (one word and its translation per entry) may 
be available and of substantial usefulness for im- 
proving the performance of statistical translation 
systems. This is especially the case for highly in- 
flected languages like German.

  We address the question of how to achieve a 
better exploitation of the resources for training the 
parameters for statistical machine translation by 
taking into account explicit knowledge about the 
languages under consideration.  In our approach 
we introduce equivalence classes in order to ig- 
nore information not relevant to the translation


process.  We furthermore suggest the use of hi- 
erarchical lexicon models.
  The paper is organized as follows.  After re- 
viewing the statistical approach to machine trans- 
lation, we first explain our motivation for exam- 
ining the morphological characteristics of an in- 
flected language like German. We then describe 
the chosen output representation after the analysis 
and present our approach for exploiting the infor- 
mation from morpho-syntactic analysis.  Experi- 
mental results on the German-English Verbmobil

Language Model





The goal of the translation process in statisti- 
cal machine translation can be formulated as fol- 
lows:  A source language string
is to be translated into a target language string
           . In the experiments reported in this 
paper, the source language is German and the tar- 
get language is English.  Every English string is 
considered as a possible translation for the input. 
If we assign a probability                   to each pair 
of strings              , then according to Bayes’ de- 
cision rule, we have to choose the English string 
that maximizes the product of the English lan- 
guage model               and the string translation 
model                  .
  Many existing systems for statistical machine 
translation (Wang and Waibel, 1997; Nießen et 
al., 1998; Och and Weber, 1998) make use of a 
special way of structuring the string translation 
model like proposed by (Brown et al., 1993): The 
correspondence between the words in the source 
and the target string is described by alignments 
which assign one target word position to each 
source word position.	The lexicon probability 
of a certain English word	is assumed
to depend basically only on the source word 
aligned to it.
  The overall architecture of the statistical trans- 
lation approach is depicted in Figure 1.  In this 
figure we already anticipate the fact that we can 
transform the source strings in a certain manner.

3   Basic Considerations

corpora.  In general, the resulting probabilistic 
lexica contain all word forms occurring in this 
training corpora as separate entries, not taking 
into account whether or not they are derivatives of 
the same lemma. Bearing in mind that 40% of the 
word forms have only been seen once in training 
(see Table 2), it is obvious that learning the cor- 
rect translations is difficult for many words. Be- 
sides, new input sentences are expected to con- 
tain unknown word forms, for which no transla- 
tion can be retrieved from the lexica.  As Table
2 shows, this problem is especially relevant for 
highly inflected languages like German: Texts in 
German contain many more different word forms 
than their English translations. The table also re- 
veals that these words are often derived from a 
much smaller set of base forms (“lemmata”), and 
when we look at the number of different lemmata 
and the respective number of lemmata, for which 
there is only one occurrence in the training data, 
German and English texts are more resembling.
  Another aspect is the fact that conventional dic- 
tionaries are often available in an electronic form 
for the considered language pair.   Their usabil- 
ity for statistical machine translation is restricted


because they are substantially different from full 
bilingual parallel corpora inasmuch the entries are 
often pairs of base forms that are translations of 
each other, whereas the corpora contain full sen- 
tences with inflected forms. To make the informa- 
tion taken from external dictionaries more useful 
for the translation of inflected language is an in- 
teresting objective.
  As a consequence of these considerations, we 
aim at taking into account the interdependencies 
between the different derivatives of the same base 
form.

4   Output Representation after
Morpho-syntactic Analysis

We use GERCG, a constraint grammar parser for 
German for lexical analysis and morphological 
and syntactic disambiguation.  For a description 
of the Constraint Grammar approach we refer the 
reader to (Karlsson, 1990). Figure 2 gives an ex- 
ample of the information provided by this tool.

Figure 2: Sample analysis of a German sentence

  A full word form is represented by the infor- 
mation provided by the morpho-syntactic anal- 
ysis: From the interpretation “gehen-V-IND- 
PR¨AS-SG1”, i.e. the lemma plus part of speech 
plus the other tags the word form “gehe” can 
be restored.  From Figure 2 we see that the tool 
can quite reliably disambiguate between differ- 
ent readings: It infers for instance that the word


“wollen” is a verb in the indicative present first 
person plural form.  Without any context taken 
into account, “wollen” has other readings. It can 
even be interpreted as derived not from a verb, 
but from an adjective with the meaning “made of 
wool”. In this sense, the information inherent to 
the original word forms is augmented by the dis- 
ambiguating analyzer. This can be useful for de- 
riving the correct translation of ambiguous words.
  In the rare cases where the tools returned more 
than one reading, it is often possible to apply sim- 
ple heuristics based on domain specific preference 
rules or to use a more general, non-ambiguous 
analysis.
  The new representation of the corpus where 
full word forms are replaced by lemma plus mor- 
phological and syntactic tags makes it possible 
to gradually reduce the information:  For exam- 
ple we can consider certain instances of words as 
equivalent. We have used this fact to better exploit 
the bilingual training data along two directions: 
Omitting unimportant information and using hi- 
erarchical translation models.

5	Equivalence classes of words with 
similar Translations

Inflected forms of words in the input language 
contain information that is not relevant for trans- 
lation.	This is especially true for the task of 
translating from a highly inflected language like 
German into English for instance: In bilingual 
German-English corpora, the German part con- 
tains many more different word forms than the 
English part (see Table 2).  It is useful for the 
process of statistical machine translation to define 
equivalence classes of word forms which tend to 
be translated by the same target language word, 
because then, the resulting statistical translation 
lexica become smoother and the coverage is sig- 
nificantly improved.  We construct these equiva- 
lence classes by omitting those informations from 
morpho-syntactic analysis, which are not relevant 
for the translation task.
  The representation of the corpus like it is pro- 
vided by the analyzing tools helps to identify - 
and access - the unimportant information.  The 
definition of relevant and unimportant informa- 
tion, respectively, depends on many factors like 
the involved languages, the translation direction


and the choice of the models.
  Linguistic knowledge can provide information 
about which characteristics of an input sentence 
are crucial to the translation task and which can 
be ignored, but it is desirable to find a method 
for automating this decision process.  We found 
that the impact on the end result due to different 
choices of features to be ignored was not large 
enough to serve as reliable criterion. Instead, we 
could think of defining a likelihood criterion on 
a held-out corpus for this purpose. Another pos- 
sibility is to assess the impact on the alignment 
quality after training, which can be evaluated au- 
tomatically (Langlais et al., 1998; Och and Ney,
2000), but as we found that the alignment quality 
on the Verbmobil data is consistently very high, 
and extremely robust against manipulation of the 
training data, we abandoned this approach.
  We resorted to detecting candidates from the 
probabilistic lexica trained for translation from 
German to English.  For this, we focussed on 
those derivatives of the same base form, which 
resulted in the same translation.   For each set 
of tags, we counted how often an additional tag 
could be replaced by a certain other tag without 
effect on the translation.  Table 1 gives some of 
the most frequently identified candidates to be ig- 
nored while translating: The gender of nouns is 
irrelevant for their translation (which is straight- 
forward, because the gender is unambiguous for a 
certain noun) and the case, i.e. nominative, dative, 
accusative. For the genitive forms, the translation 
in English differs. For verbs we found the candi- 
dates number and person. That is, the translation 
of the first person singular form of a verb is of- 
ten the same as the translation of the third person 
plural form, for example.

which were most often identified as irrelevant for 
translation from German to English.

6   Hierarchical Models

One way of taking into account the interdepen- 
dencies of different derivatives of the same base 
form is to introduce equivalence classes    at vari- 
ous levels of abstraction starting with the inflected 
form and ending with the lemma.
  Consider,   for  example,   the  German  verb 
form          "ankomme", which is derived from 
the  lemma  "ankommen" and  which  can  be 
translated into English by         "arrive". The 
hierarchy of equivalence classes is as follows:


"ankommen-V-IND-PR¨AS-SG1" 
"ankommen-V-IND-PR¨AS-SG" 
"ankommen-V-IND-PR¨AS"

.

"ankommen"


  is the maximal number of morpho-syntactic 
tags.             contains the forms "ankomme", 
"ankommst" and "ankommt";  in           the 
number (SG or PL) is ignored and so on.  The 
largest equivalence class contains all derivatives 
of the infinitive "ankommen".
  We can now define the lexicon probability of a 
word    to be translated by    with respect to the 
level  :

where		is the representation of a 
word where the lemma	and	additional tags 
are taken into account.  For the example above, 
"ankommen",	"V", and so on.
          is the probability of    for a given    . 
We make the assumption that this probability does 
not depend on  .              is always assumed to be
1.  In other words, the inflected form can non- 
ambiguously be derived from the full interpreta- 
tion.



As  a  consequence,  we  dropped  those  tags,
       

is the probability of the translation for 
to belong to the equivalence class	. The sum


over       amounts to summing up over all possible 
readings of   .1
  We combine the     by means of linear interpo- 
lation:

7   Translation Experiments

Experiments were carried out on Verbmobil data, 
which consists of spontaneously spoken dialogs 
in the appointment scheduling domain (Wahlster,
1993).  German source sentences are translated 
into English.

7.1   Treatment of Ambiguity

Common bilingual corpora normally contain full 
sentences which provide enough context informa- 
tion for ruling out all but one reading for an in- 
flected word form.  To reduce the remaining un- 
certainty, we have implemented preference rules. 
For instance, we assume that the corpus is cor- 
rectly true-case-converted beforehand and as a 
consequence, we drop non-noun interpretations 
of uppercase words.  Besides, we prefer indica- 
tive verb readings instead of subjunctive or im- 
perative. For the remaining ambiguities, we resort 
to the unambiguous parts of the readings, i.e. we 
drop all tags causing mixed interpretations.
  There are some special problems with the anal- 
ysis of external lexica, which do not provide 
enough context to enable efficient disambigua- 
tion. We are currently implementing methods for 
handling this special situation.
  It can be argued that it would be more elegant to 
leave the decision between different readings, for 
instance, to the overall decision process in search. 
We plan this integration for the future.

7.2   Performance Measures

We use the following evaluation criteria (Nießen 
et al., 2000):

SSER (subjective sentence error rate):
Each translated sentence is judged by a hu- 
man examiner according to an error scale 
from 0.0 (semantically and syntactically cor- 
rect) to 1.0 (completely wrong).

  1 The probability functions are defined to return zero for 
impossible interpretations of   .


ISER (information item semantic error rate): 
The test sentences are segmented into infor- 
mation items; for each of them, the trans- 
lation candidates are assigned either “ok” 
or an error class.  If the intended informa- 
tion is conveyed, the error count is not in- 
creased, even if there are slight syntactical 
errors, which do not seriously deteriorate the 
intelligibility.

7.3   Translation Results
The training set consists of 58 322 sentence pairs.

training corpus used for training the parameters of 
Model 4 proposed in (Brown et al., 1993). Testing

  We used a translation system called “single- 
word based approach” described in (Tillmann and 
Ney, 2000) and compared to other approaches in 
(Ney et al., 2000).

7.3.1   Lexicon Combination
  So far we have performed experiments with hi- 
erarchical lexica, where two levels are combined,


i.e.	in Equation (2) is set to 1.	and	are 
set to		and	is modeled as a uniform 
distribution over all derivations of the lemma 
occurring in the training data plus the base form 
itself, in case it is not contained. The process of 
lemmatization is unique in the majority of cases, 
and as a consequence, the sum in Equation (1) is 
not needed for a two-level lexicon combination of 
full word forms and lemmata.
  As the results summarized in Table 4 show, the 
combined lexicon outperforms the conventional 
one-level lexicon.  As expected, the quality gain 
achieved by smoothing the lexicon is larger if 
the training procedure can take advantage of an 
additional conventional dictionary to learn trans- 
lation pairs, because these dictionaries typically 
only contain base forms of words, whereas trans- 
lations of fully inflected forms are needed in the 
test situation.
  Examples taken from the test set are given in 
Figure 3. Smoothing the lexicon entries over the 
derivatives of the same lemma enables the trans- 
lation of “sind” by “would” instead of “are”. The 
smoothed lexicon contains the translation “conve- 
nient” for any derivative of “bequem”. The com- 
parative “more convenient” would be the com- 
pletely correct translation.

7.3.2	Equivalence classes

  As already mentioned, we resorted to choos- 
ing one single reading for each word by applying 
some heuristics (see Section 7.1).  For the nor- 
mal training corpora, unlike additional external 
dictionaries, this is not critical because they con- 
tain predominantly full sentences which provide 
enough context for an efficient disambiguation. 
Currently, we are working on the problem of ana- 
lyzing the entries in conventional dictionaries, but 
for the time being, experiments for equivalence 
classes have been carried out using only bilingual 
corpora for estimating the model parameters.
  Table 5 shows the effect of the introduction of 
equivalence classes.  The information from the 
morpho-syntactic analyzer (stems plus tags like 
described in Section 4) is reduced by dropping 
unimportant information like described in Section
5. Both error metrics could be decreased in com- 
parison to the usage of the original corpus with 
inflected word forms. A reduction of 3.3% of the


information item semantic error rate shows that 
more of the intended meaning could be found in 
the produced translations.

classes. For the baseline we used the original in- 
flected word forms.

  The first two examples in Figure 4 demonstrate 
the effect of the disambiguating analyzer which 
identifies “Hotelzimmer” as singular on the ba- 
sis of the context (the word itself can represent 
the plural form as well), and “das” as article in 
contrast to a pronoun.  The third example shows 
the advantage of grouping words in equivalence 
classes:  The training data does not contain the 
word “billigeres”, but when generalizing over the 
gender and case information, a correct translation 
can be produced.

8   Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented methods for a better exploita- 
tion  of  the  bilingual training data  for  statisti- 
cal machine translation by explicitly taking into 
account the interdependencies of the different 
derivatives of the same base form. We suggest the 
usage of hierarchical models as well as an alter- 
native representation of the data in combination 
with the identification and omission of informa- 
tion not relevant for the translation task.
  First experiments prove their general applica- 
bility to realistic tasks such as spontaneously spo- 
ken dialogs. We expect the described methods to 
yield more improvement of the translation quality 
for cases where much smaller amounts of training 
data are available.
  As there is a large overlap between the mod- 
eled events in the combined probabilistic models, 
we assume that log-linear combination would re- 
sult in more improvement of the translation qual- 
ity than the combination by linear interpolation 
does.  We will investigate this in the future.  We 
also plan to integrate the decision regarding the 
choice of readings into the search process.
