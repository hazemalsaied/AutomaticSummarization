The RWTH System for Statistical Translation of Spoken Dialogues H. Ney, F. J. Och, S. Vogel Lehrstuhl fu?r Informatik VI, Computer Science Department RWTH Aachen, University of Technology D-52056 Aachen, Germany ABSTRACT This paper gives an overview of our work on statistical ma.chine translation of spoken dialogues, in particular in the framework of the Verbmobil project. The goal of the Verbmobil project is the translation of spoken dialogues in the domains of appointment scheduling and travel plan.ning. Starting with the Bayes decision rule as in speech recognition, we show how the required probability distri.butions can be structured into three parts: the language model, the alignment model and the lexicon model. We describe the components of the system and report results on the Verbmobil task. The experience obtained in the Verbmobil project, in particular a large-scale end-to-end evaluation, showed that the statistical approach resulted in significantly lower error rates than three competing transla.tion approaches: the sentence error rate was 29% in compar.ison with 52% to 62% for the other translation approaches. 1. INTRODUCTION In comparison with written language, speech and espe.cially spontaneous speech poses additional difficulties for the task of automatic translation. Typically, these difficul .ties are caused by errors of the recognition process, which is carried out before the translation process. As a result, the sentence to be translated is not necessarily well-formed from a syntactic point-of-view. Even without recognition errors, speech translation has to cope with a lack of conventional syntactic structures because the structures of spontaneous speech differ from that of written language. The statistical approach shows the potential to tackle these problems for the following reasons. First, the statisti.cal approach is able to avoid hard decisions at any level of the translation process. Second, for any source sentence, a translated sentence in the target language is guaranteed to be generated. In most cases, this will be hopefully a syn.tactically perfect sentence in the target language; but even if this is not the case, in most cases, the translated sentence will convey the meaning of the spoken sentence. . Whereas statistical modelling is widely used in speech recognition, there are so far only a few research groups that apply statistical modelling to language translation. The pre.sentation here is based on work carried out in the framework of the EuTrans project [8] and the Verbmobil project [25]. 2. STATISTICAL DECISION THEORY AND LINGUISTICS 2.1 The Statistical Approach The use of statistics in computational linguistics has been extremely controversial for more than three decades. The controversy is very well summarized by the statement of Chomsky in 1969 [6]: ?It must be recognized that the notion of a ?probability of a sentence ? is an entirely useless one, under any interpretation of this term? . This statement was considered to be true by the major.ity of experts from artificial intelligence and computational linguistics, and the concept of statistics was banned from computational linguistics for many years. What is overlooked in this statement is the fact that, in an automatic system for speech recognition or text translation, we are faced with the problem of taking decisions. It is exactly here where statistical decision theory comes in. In speech recognition, the success of the statistical approach is based on the equation: Speech Recognition = Acoustic?Linguistic Modelling + Statistical Decision Theory Similarly, for machine translation, the statistical approach is expressed by the equation: Machine Translation = Linguistic Modelling + Statistical Decision Theory For the ? low-level ? description of speech and image signals, it is widely accepted that the statistical framework allows an efficient coupling between the observations and the mod.els, which is often described by the buzz word ?subsymbolic processing? . But there is another advantage in using prob.ability distributions in that they offer an explicit formalism for expressing and combining hypothesis scores: ? The probabilities are directly used as scores: These scores are normalized, which is a desirable property: when increasing the score for a certain element in the set of all hypotheses, there must be one or several other elements whose scores are reduced at the same time. ? It is straightforward to combine scores: depending on the task, the probabilities are either multiplied or added. ? Weak and vague dependencies can be modelled eas.ily. Especially in spoken and written natural language, there are nuances and shades that require ? grey levels? between 0 and 1. 2.2 Bayes Decision Rule and System Architecture In machine translation, the goal is the translation of a text given in a source language into a target language. We are given a source string fJ1 = f1...fj ...fJ , which is to be translated into a target string eI1 = e1...ei...eI . In this arti.cle, the term word always refers to a full-form word. Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability which is given by Bayes decision rule [5]: e?I1 = argmax eI1 {Pr(eI1|fJ1 )} = argmax eI1 {Pr(eI1) ? Pr(fJ1 |eI1)} . Here, Pr(eI1) is the language model of the target language, and Pr(fJ1 |eI1) is the string translation model which will be decomposed into lexicon and alignment models. The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language. The overall architecture of the statistical translation approach is sum.marized in Figure 1. In general, as shown in this figure, there may be additional transformations to make the translation task simpler for the algorithm. The transformations may range from the cate.gorization of single words and word groups to more complex preprocessing steps that require some parsing of the source string. We have to keep in mind that in the search procedure both the language and the translation model are applied af.ter the text transformation steps. However, to keep the notation simple, we will not make this explicit distinction in the subsequent exposition. 3. ALIGNMENT MODELLING 3.1 Concept A key issue in modelling the string translation probabil.ity Pr(fJ1 |eI1) is the question of how we define the corre.spondence between the words of the target sentence and the words of the source sentence. In typical cases, we can as.sume a sort of pairwise dependence by considering all word pairs (fj , ei) for a given sentence pair (fJ1 ; eI1). Here, we will further constrain this model by assigning each source word to exactly one target word. Later, this requirement will be relaxed. Models describing these types of dependencies are referred to as alignment models [5, 24]. When aligning the words in parallel texts, we typically observe a strong localization effect. Figure 2 illustrates this effect for the language pair German? English. In many cases, although not always, there is an additional property: over large portions of the source string, the alignment is mono.tone.

We rewrite the probability for the translation model by introducing the ?hidden? alignments aJ1 := a1...aj ...aJ for each sentence pair (fJ1 ; eI1). To structure this probability distribution, we fac.torize it over the positions in the source sentence and limit the alignment dependencies to a first-order dependence: Pr(fJ1 |eI1) = p(J |I) ? X aJ1 J Y j=1 [p(aj |aj? 1, I, J) ? p(fj |eaj )] . Here, we have the following probability distributions: ? the sentence length probability: p(J |I), which is in.cluded here for completeness, but can be omitted with.out loss of performance; ? the lexicon probability: p(f |e); ? the alignment probability: p(aj |aj? 1, I, J). By making the alignment probability p(aj |aj? 1, I, J) depen.dent on the jump width aj ? aj? 1 instead of the absolute positions aj , we obtain the so-called homogeneous hidden Markov model, for short HMM [24]. We can also use a zero-order model p(aj |j, I, J), where there is only a dependence on the absolute position index j of the source string. This is the so-called model IBM-2 [5]. Assuming a uniform alignment probability p(aj |j, I, J) = 1/I, we arrive at the so-called model IBM-1. These models can be extended to allow for source words having no counterpart in the translation. Formally, this is incorporated into the alignment models by adding a so.called ? empty word? at position i = 0 to the target sentence and aligning all source words without a direct translation to this empty word. well I think if we can make it at eight on both days ja ich den ke we nn wir das hin kri ege n an bei den Ta ge n ac ht Uh r Figure 2: Word-to-word alignment. In [5], more refined alignment models are introduced by using the concept of fertility. The idea is that often a word in the target language may be aligned to several words in the source language. This is the so-called model IBM-3. Us.ing, in addition, first-order alignment probabilities along the positions of the source string leads us to model IBM-4. Al.though these models take one-to-many alignments explicitly into account, the lexicon probabilities p(f |e) are still based on single words in each of the two languages. In systematic experiments, it was found that the qual.ity of the alignments determined from the bilingual training corpus has a direct effect on the translation quality [14]. 3.3 Alignment Template Approach A general shortcoming of the baseline alignment models is that they are mainly designed to model the lexicon de .pendences between single words. Therefore, we extend the approach to handle word groups or phrases rather than sin.gle words as the basis for the alignment models [15]. In other words, a whole group of adjacent words in the source sentence may be aligned with a whole group of adjacent words in the target language. As a result, the context of words tends to be explicitly taken into account, and the differences in local word orders between source and target languages can be learned explicitly. Figure 3 shows some of the extracted alignment templates for a sentence pair from the Verbmobil training corpus. The training algorithm for the alignment templates extracts all phrase pairs which are aligned in the training corpus up to a maximum length of 7 words. To improve the generalization capability of the align.ment templates, the templates are determined for bilingual word classes rather than words directly. These word classes are determined by an automatic clustering procedure [13]. 4. SEARCH The task of the search algorithm is to generate the most likely target sentence eI1 of unknown length I for an observed source sentence fJ1 . The search must make use of all three knowledge sources as illustrated by Figure 4: the alignment model, the lexicon model and the language model. All three okay , how about the nineteenth at maybe , two o?clock in the afternoon ? oka y , wie sie ht es am ne un ze hnt en aus , vie lle ich t um zw ei Uhr na chm itt ags ? Figure 3: Example of a word alignment and of ex.tracted alignment templates. of them must contribute in the final decision about the words in the target language. To illustrate the specific details of the search problem, we slightly change the definitions of the alignments: ? we use inverted alignments as in the model IBM-4 [5] which define a mapping from target to source positions rather the other way round. ? we allow several positions in the source language to be covered, i.e. we consider mappings B of the form: B : i ? Bi ? {1, ...j, ...J} We replace the sum over all alignments by the best alignment, which is referred to as maximum approxima.tion in speech recognition. Using a trigram language model p(ei|, ei? 2, ei? 1), we obtain the following search criterion: max BI1 ,eI1 I Y i=1 2 4[p(ei|ei? 1i? 2) ? p(Bi|Bi? 1, I, J) ? Y j? Bi p(fj |ei)] 3 5 Considering this criterion, we can see that we can build up hypotheses of partial target sentences in a bottom-to.top strategy over the positions i of the target sentence ei1 as illustrated in Figure 5. An important constraint for the alignment is that all positions of the source sentence should be covered exactly once. This constraint is similar to that of the travelling salesman problem where each city has to be visited exactly once. Details on various search strategies can be found in [4, 9, 12, 21]. In order to take long context dependences into account, we use a class -based five-gram language model with backing.off. Beam-search is used to handle the huge search space. To normalize the costs of partial hypotheses covering different parts of the input sentence, an (optimistic) estimation of the remaining cost is added to the current accumulated cost as follows. For each word in the source sentence, a lower bound on its translation cost is determined beforehand.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 5.1 The Task and the Corpus Within the Verbmobil project, spoken dialogues were recorded. These dialogues were manually transcribed and later manually translated by Verbmobil partners (Hildes .heim for Phase I and Tu? bingen for Phase II). Since different human translators were involved, there is great variability in the translations. Each of these so-called dialogues turns may consist of sev.eral sentences spoken by the same speaker and is sometimes SOURCE POSITION TA RG ET P O SI TI O N i i-1 j Figure 5: Illustration of bottom-to-top search. rather long. As a result, there is no one-to-one correspon.dence between source and target sentences. To achieve a one-to-one correspondence, the dialogue turns are split into shorter segments using punctuation marks as potential split points. Since the punctuation marks in source and target sentences are not necessarily identical, a dynamic program.ming approach is used to find the optimal segmentation points. The number of segments in the source sentence and in the test sentence can be different. The segmentation is scored using a word-based alignment model, and the seg.mentation with the best score is selected. This segmented corpus is the starting point for the training of translation and language models. Alignment models of increasing com.plexity are trained on this bilingual corpus [14]. A standard vocabulary had been defined for the various speech recognizers used in Verbmobil. However, not all words of this vocabulary were observed in the training cor.pus. Therefore, the translation vocabulary was extended semi-automatically by adding about 13 000 German? English word pairs from an online bilingual lexicon available on the web. The resulting lexicon contained not only word-word entries, but also multi-word translations, especially for the large number of German compound words. To counteract the sparseness of the training data, a couple of straightfor.ward rule-based preprocessing steps were applied before any other type of processing: ? categorization of proper names for persons and cities, ? normalization of: ? numbers, ? time and date phrases, ? spelling: don?t ? do not,... ? splitting of German compound words. Table 1 gives the characteristics of the training corpus and the lexicon. The 58 000 sentence pairs comprise about half a million running words for each language of the bilin.gual training corpus. The vocabulary size is the number of distinct full-form words seen in the training corpus. Punctu.ation marks are treated as regular words in the translation approach. Notice the large number of word singletons, i. e. words seen only once. The extended vocabulary is the vo.cabulary after adding the manual bilingual lexicon. 5.2 Offline Results During the progress of the Verbmobil project, different variants of statistical translation were implemented, and ex -Table 1: Bilingual training corpus, recognition lex.icon and translation lexicon (PM = punctuation mark).

Vocab. 11 501 6 867 perimental tests were performed for both text and speech input. To summarize these experimental tests, we briefly report experimental offline results for the following transla.tion approaches: ? single-word based approach [20]; ? alignment template approach [15]; ? cascaded transducer approach [23]: unlike the other two-approaches, this approach re.quires a semi-automatic training procedure, in which the structure of the finite state transducers is designed manually. For more details, see [23]. The offline tests were performed on text input for the trans .lation direction from German to English. The test set con .sisted of 251 sentences, which comprised 2197 words and 430 punctuation marks. The results are shown in Table 2. To judge and compare the quality of different translation ap .proaches in offline tests, we typically use the following error measures [11]: ? mWER (multi-reference word error rate): For each test sentence sk in the source language, there are several reference translationsRk = {rk1, . . . , rknk} in the target language. For each translation of the test sentence sk, the edit distances (number of substitu.tions, deletions and insertions as in speech recognition) to all sentences in Rk are calculated, and the smallest distance is selected and used as error measure. ? SSER (subjective sentence error rate): Each translated sentence is judged by a human exam.iner according to an error scale from 0.0 (semantically and syntactically correct) to 1.0 (completely wrong). Both error measures are reported in Table 2. Although the experiments with the cascaded transducers [23] were not fully optimized yet, the preliminary results indicated that this semi-automatic approach does not generalize as well as the other two fully automatic approaches. Among these two, the alignment template approach was found to work consistently better across different test sets (and also tasks different from Verbmobil). Therefore, the alignment tem.plate approach was used in the final Verbmobil prototype system. 5.3 Disambiguation Examples In the statistical translation approach as we have pre.sented it, no explicit word sense disambiguation is per.formed. However, a kind of implicit disambiguation is pos.sible due to the context information of the alignment tem.plates and the language model as shown by the examples in Table 3. The first two groups of sentences contain the Table 2: Comparison of three statistical translation approaches (test on text input: 251 sentences = 2197 words + 430 punctuation marks). Translation mWER SSER Approach [%] [%] Single-Word Based 38.2 35.7 Alignment Template 36.0 29.0 Cascaded Transducers >40.0 >40.0 verbs ? gehen? and ? annehmen? which have different transla.tions, some of which are rather collocational. The correct translation is only possible by taking the whole sentence into account. Some improvement can be achieved by ap .plying morpho-syntactic analysis, e.g handling of the sepa.rated verb prefixes in German [10]. The last two sentences show the implicit disambiguation of the temporal and spa.tial sense for the German preposition ? vor?. Although the system has not been tailored to handle such types of disam.biguation, the translated sentences are all acceptable, apart from the sentence: The meeting is to five. 5.4 Integration into the Verbmobil Prototype System The statistical approach to machine translation is em.bodied in the stattrans module which is integrated into the Verbmobil prototype system. We briefly review those as.pects of it that are relevant for the statistical translation ap.proach. The implementation supports the translation direc.tions from German to English and from English to German. In regular processing mode, the stattrans module receives its input from the repair module [18]. At that time, the word lattices and best hypotheses from the speech recogni.tion systems have already been prosodically annotated, i.e. information about prosodic segment boundaries, sentence mode and accentuated syllables are added to each edge in the word lattice [2]. The translation is performed on the single best sentence hypothesis of the recognizer. The prosodic boundaries and the sentence mode informa.tion are utilized by the stattrans module as follows. If there is a major phrase boundary, a full stop or question mark is inserted into the word sequence, depending on the sentence mode as indicated by the prosody module. Additional com.mas are inserted for other types of segment boundaries. The prosody module calculates probabilities for segment bound.aries, and thresholds are used to decide if the sentence marks are to be inserted. These thresholds have been selected in such a way that, on the average, for each dialogue turn, a good segmentation is obtained. The segment boundaries re.strict possible word reordering between source and target language. This not only improves translation quality, but also restricts the search space and thereby speeds up the translation process. 5.5 Large-Scale End-to-End Evaluation 
Whereas the offline tests reported above were important 
for the optimization and tuning of the system, the most 
important evaluation was the final evaluation of the Verb.mobil prototype in spring 2000. This end -to-end evaluation 
of the Verbmobil system was performed at the University 
of Hamburg [19]. In each session of this evaluation, two 
native speakers conducted a dialogue. They did not have 
any direct contact and could only interact by speaking and 
listening to the Verbmobil system. 
Three other translation approaches had been integrated 
into the Verbmobil prototype system: 
? a classical transfer approach [3, 7, 22], 
which is based on a manually designed analysis gram.mar, a set of transfer rules, and a generation grammar, 
? a dialogue act based approach [16], 
which amounts to a sort of slot filling by classifying 
Table 3: Disambiguation examples (?: using morpho-syntactic analysis).

? an example-based approach [1], 
where a sort of nearest neighbour concept is applied to 
the set of bilingual training sentence pairs after suit .able preprocessing. 
In the final end-to-end evaluation, human evaluators 
judged the translation quality for each of the four trans .lation results using the following criterion: 
Is the sentence approximatively correct: yes/no? 
The evaluators were asked to pay particular attention to 
the semantic information (e.g. date and place of meeting, participants etc) contained in the translation. A missing translation as it may happen for the transfer approach or other approaches was counted as wrong translation. The evaluation was based on 5069 dialogue turns for the trans.lation from German to English and on 4136 dialogue turns for the translation from English to German. The speech recognizers used had a word error rate of about 25%. The overall sentence error rates, i.e. resulting from recognition and translation, are summarized in Table 4. As we can see, the error rates for the statistical approach are smaller by a factor of about 2 in comparison with the other approaches. In agreement with other evaluation experiments, these ex .periments show that the statistical modelling approach may be comparable to or better than the conventional rule-based approach. In particular, the statistical approach seems to have the advantage if robustness is important, e.g. when the input string is not grammatically correct or when it is corrupted by recognition errors. Although both text and speech input are translated with good quality on the average by the statistical approach, Table 4: Sentence error rates of end-to-end evalua.tion (speech recognizer with WER=25%; corpus of 5069 and 4136 dialogue turns for translation Ger.man to English and English to German, respec.tively). Translation Method Error [%] Semantic Transfer 62 Dialogue Act Based 60 Example Based 52 Statistical 29 there are examples where the syntactic structure of the pro.duced sentence is not correct. Some of these syntactic errors are related to long range dependencies and syntactic struc .tures that are not captured by the m-gram language model used. To cope with these problems, morpho-syntactic anal.ysis [10] and grammar-based language models [17] are cur.rently being studied. 6. SUMMARY In this paper, we have given an overview of the statistical approach to machine translation and especially its imple.mentation in the Verbmobil prototype system. The sta.tistical system has been trained on about 500 000 running words from a bilingual German? English corpus. Transla.tions are performed for both directions, i.e. from German to English and from English to German. Comparative eval.uations with other translation approaches of the Verbmo.bil prototype system show that the statistical translation is superior, especially in the presence of speech input and ungrammatical input.

Training Toolkit In a follow-up project of the statistical machine translation project during the 1999 Johns Hopkins University workshop, we have developped a publically available toolkit for the training of different alignment models, including the models IBM-1 to IBM-5 [5] and an HMM alignment model [14, 24].
