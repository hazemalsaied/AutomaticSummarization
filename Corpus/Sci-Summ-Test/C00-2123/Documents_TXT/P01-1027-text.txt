One way to deal with this problem within the statistical framework is to use max.imum entropy methods. In this paper, we present how to use this type of in.formation within a statistical machine translation system. We show that it is possible to significantly decrease train.ing and test corpus perplexity of the translation models. In addition, we per.form a rescoring of  -Best lists us.ing our maximum entropy model and thereby yield an improvement in trans .lation quality. Experimental results are presented on the so-called ? Verbmobil Task?. 1 Introduction Typically, the lexicon models used in statistical machine translation systems are only single-word based, that is one word in the source language cor.responds to only one word in the target language. Those lexicon models lack from context infor .mation that can be extracted from the same paral.lel corpus. This additional information could be: Simple context information: information of the words surrounding the word pair; Syntactic information: part-of-speech in.formation, syntactic constituent, sentence mood; Semantic information: disambiguation in.formation (e.g. from WordNet), cur.rent/previous speech or dialog act. To include this additional information within the statistical framework we use the maximum en .tropy approach. This approach has been applied in natural language processing to a variety of tasks. (Berger et al, 1996) applies this approach to the so-called IBM Candide system to build con.text dependent models, compute automatic sen.tence splitting and to improve word reordering in translation. Similar techniques are used in (Pap.ineni et al, 1996; Papineni et al, 1998) for so.called direct translation models instead of those proposed in (Brown et al, 1993). (Foster, 2000) describes two methods for incorporating informa.tion about the relative position of bilingual word pairs into a maximum entropy translation model. Other authors have applied this approach to lan.guage modeling (Rosenfeld, 1996; Martin et al, 1999; Peters and Klakow, 1999). A short review of the maximum entropy approach is outlined in Section 3. 2 Statistical Machine Translation The goal of the translation process in statisti.cal machine translation can be formulated as fol.lows: A source language string is to be translated into a target language string . In the experiments reported in this paper, the source language is German and the target language is English. Every target string is considered as a possible translation for the input. If we assign a probability   to each pair of strings     , then according to Bayes ? de .cision rule, we have to choose the target string that maximizes the product of the target language model    and the string translation model . Many existing systems for statistical machine translation (Berger et al, 1994; Wang and Waibel, 1997; Tillmann et al, 1997; Nie?en et al, 1998) make use of a special way of structuring the string translation model like proposed by (Brown et al, 1993): The correspondence between the words in the source and the target string is described by alignments that assign one target word position to each source word position. The lexicon prob.ability fffi    of a certain target word  to occur in the target string is assumed to depend basically only on the source word  aligned to it. These alignment models are similar to the con.cept of Hidden Markov models (HMM) in speech recognition. The alignment mapping is flffi "!# from source position fl to target position $!%# . The alignment !   may contain align.ments !%#&(' with the ?empty? word ) to ac.count for source words that are not aligned to any target word. In (statistical) alignment models fi ! , the alignment !   is introduced as a hidden variable. Typically, the search is performed using the so.called maximum approximation: * +%,.-0/1+2 354 6 98:<;>=

Typically, the probability FG #  #H ! # is approximated by a lexicon model fffi #  ;ML by dropping the dependencies on #H , ! #H , and . Obviously, this simplification is not true for a lot of natural language phenomena. The straightfor.ward approach to include more dependencies in the lexicon model would be to add additional de .pendencies(e.g. ffJ #  ;5L ;ML.N 6 ). This approach would yield a significant data sparseness problem. Here, the role of maximum entropy (ME) is to build a stochastic model that efficiently takes a larger context into account. In the following, we will use ffJ  OP to denote the probability that the ME model assigns to  in the context O in order to distinguish this model from the basic lexicon model fffi . In the maximum entropy approach we describe all properties that we feel are useful by so-called feature functions Qfi O    . For example, if we want to model the existence or absence of a spe.cific word R in the context of an English word which has the translation  we can express this dependency using the following feature function: Q 3TSBUV3MU O 7XW if    R and RZY O ' otherwise (1) The ME principle suggests that the optimal parametric form of a model fffi  OZ taking into account only the feature functions Q\[ ^] W ._ is given by: fffi OP W ` OZfia 2cb Ied : [ D cf [gQ\[c O 5K Here ` OP is a normalization factor. The re.sulting model has an exponential form with free parameters f [ ^] W ._ . The parameter values which maximize the likelihood for a given training corpus can be computed with the so.called GIS algorithm (general iterative scaling) or its improved version IIS (Pietra et al, 1997; Berger et al, 1996). It is important to notice that we will have to ob.tain one ME model for each target word observed in the training data. 4 Contextual information and training events In order to train the ME model ff 3  OP associated to a target word  , we need to construct a corre.sponding training sample from the whole bilin.gual corpus depending on the contextual informa.tion that we want to use. To construct this sample, we need to know the word-to-word alignment be .tween each sentence pair within the corpus. That is obtained using the Viterbi alignment provided by a translation model as described in (Brown et al., 1993). Specifically, we use the Viterbi align.ment that was produced by Model 5. We use the program GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000b; Och and Ney, 2000a), which is an extension of the training program available in EGYPT (Al-Onaizan et al, 1999). Berger et al (1996) use the words that sur.round a specific word pair      as contextual in.formation. The authors propose as context the 3 words to the left and the 3 words to the right of the target word. In this work we use the following contextual information: Target context: As in (Berger et al, 1996) we consider a window of 3 words to the left and to the right of the target word considered. Source context: In addition, we consider a window of 3 words to the left of the source word  which is connected to  according to the Viterbi alignment. Word classes: Instead of using a dependency on the word identity we include also a de .pendency on word classes. By doing this, we improve the generalization of the models and include some semantic and syntactic infor.mation with. The word classes are computed automatically using another statistical train.ing procedure (Och, 1999) which often pro.duces word classes including words with the same semantic meaning in the same class. A training event, for a specific target word , is composed by three items: The source word  aligned to . The context in which the aligned pair appears. The number of occurrences of the event in the training corpus. Table 1 shows some examples of training events for the target word ?which?. 5 Features Once we have a set of training events for each tar.get word we need to describe our feature func.tions. We do this by first specifying a large pool of possible features and then by selecting a subset of ? good? features from this pool. 5.1 Features definition All the features we consider form a triple (ffAhgi  label-1  label -2) where: pos: is the position that label -2 has in a spe.cific context. label-1: is the source word  of the aligned word pair      or the word class of the source word  ( jk ). label-2: is one word of the aligned word pair or the word class to which these words belong ( jk ml ). Using this notation and given a context O : O n H\o p p n p p nrq o #H\o p p # Table 1: Some training events for the English word ? which ? . The symbol ? ? is the placeholder of the English word ? which ? in the English context. In the German part the placeholder (? ? ) corresponds to the word aligned to ? which ? , in the first example the German word ? die? , the word ? das? in the second and the word ? was? in the third. The considered English and German contexts are separated by the double bar ? p ? .The last number in the rightmost position is the number of occurrences of the event in the whole corpus.

A ME model that uses only those, predicts each source translation # with the probability ?ff 3  # determined by the empirical data. This is exactly the standard lex.icon probability fffi    employed in the transla.tion model described in (Brown et al, 1993) and in Section 2. Category 2 describes features which depend in addition on the word  R one position to the left or to the right of n . The same explanation is valid for category 3 but in this case  R could appears in any position of the context O . Categories 4 and 5 are the analogous categories to 2 and 3 using word classes instead of words. In the categories 6, 7, 8 and 9 the source context is used instead of the target context. Table 2 gives an overview of the different feature categories. Examples of specific features and their respec.tive category are shown in Table 3.

In order to re.duce the number of features we perform a thresh.old based feature selection, that is every feature which occurs less than ? times is not used. The aim of the feature selection is two-fold. Firstly, we obtain smaller models by using less features, and secondly, we hope to avoid overfitting on the training data. In order to obtain the threshold ? we compare the test corpus perplexity for various thresholds. The different threshold used in the experiments range from 0 to 512. The threshold is used as a cut-off for the number of occurrences that a spe.cific feature must appear. So a cut-off of 0 means that all features observed in the training data are used. A cut-off of 32 means those features that appear 32 times or more are considered to train the maximum entropy models. We select the English words that appear at least 150 times in the training sample which are in total 348 of the 4673 words contained in the English vocabulary. Table 4 shows the different number of features considered for the 348 English words selected using different thresholds. In choosing a reasonable threshold we have to balance the number of features and observed per.plexity. Table 4: Number of features used according to different cut-off threshold. In the second column of the table are shown the number of features used when only the English context is considered. The third column correspond to English, German and Word-Classes contexts. # features used ?

Verbmobil Task ? is a speech translation task in the domain of appointment scheduling, travel planning, and hotel reservation. The task is dif.ficult because it consists of spontaneous speech and the syntactic structures of the sentences are less restricted and highly variable. For the rescor.ing experiments we use the corpus described in Table 5. Table 5: Corpus characteristics for translation task. German English Train Sentences 58 332 Words 519 523 549 921 Vocabulary 7 940 4 673 Test Sentences 147 Words 1 968 2 173 PP (trigr. LM) (40.3) 28.8 To train the maximum entropy models we used the ?Ristad ME Toolkit ? described in (Ristad, 1997). We performed 100 iteration of the Im.proved Iterative Scaling algorithm (Pietra et al, 1997) using the corpus described in Table 6, Table 6: Corpus characteristics for perplexity quality experiments.

The training and test perplexities are shown in Table 7. As expected, the perplexity reduction in the test cor.pus is lower than in the training corpus, but in both cases better perplexities are obtained using the ME models. The best value is obtained when a threshold of 4 is used. We expected to observe strong overfitting ef.fects when a too small cut-off for features gets used. Yet, for most words the best test corpus perplexity is observed when we use all features including those that occur only once.

This algorithm take as input the standard lexicon model (not using maximum en.tropy) and the 348 models obtained with the ME training. For an hypothesis sentence  and a cor.responding alignment !   the algorithm modifies the score  fi !   according to the refined maximum entropy lexicon model. We carried out some preliminary experiments with the  -best lists of hypotheses provided by the translation system in order to make a rescor .ing of each i-th hypothesis and reorder the list ac.cording to the new score computed with the re.fined lexicon model. Unfortunately, our  -best extraction algorithm is sub-optimal, i.e. not the true best  translations are extracted. In addition, so far we had to use a limit of only W ' translations per sentence. Therefore, the results of the transla.tion experiments are only preliminary. For the evaluation of the translation quality we use the automatically computable Word Er.ror Rate (WER). The WER corresponds to the edit distance between the produced translation and one predefined reference translation. A short.coming of the WER is the fact that it requires a perfect word order. This is particularly a prob.lem for the Verbmobil task, where the word or.der of the German-English sentence pair can be quite different. As a result, the word order of the automatically generated target sentence can be different from that of the target sentence, but nevertheless acceptable so that the WER measure alone can be misleading. In order to overcome this problem, we introduce as additional measure the position-independent word error rate (PER). This measure compares the words in the two sen.tences without taking the word order into account. Depending on whether the translated sentence is longer or shorter than the target translation, the remaining words result in either insertion or dele.tion errors in addition to substitution errors. The PER is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the WER. We use the top-10 list of hypothesis provided by the translation system described in (Tillmann and Ney, 2000) for rescoring the hypothesis us.ing the ME models and sort them according to the new maximum entropy score. The translation re.sults in terms of error rates are shown in Table 8. We use Model 4 in order to perform the transla.tion experiments because Model 4 typically gives better translation results than Model 5. We see that the translation quality improves slightly with respect to the WER and PER. The translation quality improvements so far are quite small compared to the perplexity measure im.provements. We attribute this to the fact that the algorithm for computing the  -best lists is sub.optimal. Table 8: Preliminary translation results for the Verbmobil Test-147 for different contextual infor .mation and different thresholds using the top-10 translations.

We have been able to obtain a significant better test corpus perplexity and also a slight improvement in translation quality. We be .lieve that by performing a rescoring on translation word graphs we will obtain a more significant im.provement in translation quality. For the future we plan to investigate more re.fined feature selection methods in order to make the maximum entropy models smaller and better generalizing. In addition, we want to investigate more syntactic, semantic features and to include features that go beyond sentence boundaries.
