			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) has witnessed a prominent progress in the first four SIGHAN Bakeoffs.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Since Xue (2003) used character-based tagging, this method has attracted more and more attention.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Some previous work (Peng et al., 2004; Tseng et al., 2005; Low et al., 2005) illustrated the effectiveness of using characters as tagging units, while literatures (Zhang et al., 2006; Zhao and Kit, 2007a; Zhang and Clark, 2007) focus on employing lexical words or subwords as tagging units.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Because the word-based models can capture the word-level contextual information and IV knowledge.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Besides, many strategies are proposed to balance the IV and OOV performance (Wang et al., 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">CRF has been widely used in sequence labeling tasks and has a good performance (Laffertyet al., 2001).</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Zhao and Kit (2007b; 2008) at tempt to integrate global information with local information to further improve CRF-based tagging method of CWS, which provides a solid foundation for strengthening CRF learning with unsupervised learning outcomes.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">In order to increase the accuracy of tagging using CRF, we adopt the strategy, which is: if the marginal probability of characters is lower than a threshold, the modified component based on HMM will be trigged; combining the confidence measure the results will be regenerated.</S>

	<SECTION title="Our word segmentation system. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "1">In this section, we describe our system in more details.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "2">Three modules are included in our system: a basic character-based CRF tagger, HMM which revises the substrings with low marginal probability and confidence measure which combines them to regenerate the result.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "3">In addition, we also use some rules to deal with the strings within letters and numbers.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "4">2.1 Character-based CRF tagger.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "5">Tag Set A 6-tag set is adopted in our system.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "6">It includes six tags: B, B2, B3, M, E and S. Here, Tag B and E stand for the first and the last position in a multi-character word, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "7">S stands for a single-character word.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "8">B2 and B3 stand for the second and the third position in a The work described in this paper is supported by Microsoft Research Asia Funded Project.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "9">multi-character word.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "10">M stands for the fourth or more rear position in a multi-character word with more than four characters.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "11">The 6-tag set is proved to work more effectively than other tag sets in improving the segmentation performance of CRFs by Zhao et al.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "12">(2006).</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "13">Feature templates In our system, six n-gram templates, namely, C-1, C0, C1, C-1C0, C0C1, that character.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "14">In the open test, we only add another feature of ‘FRE’, the basic idea of which is if a string matches a word in an existing dictionary, it may be a clue that the string is likely a true word.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "15">Then more word boundary information can be obtained, which may be helpful for CRF learning on CWS.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "16">The dictionary we used is ① C-1C1 are selected as features, where C stands for downloaded from the Internet and consists of a character and the subscripts -1, 0 and 1 stand for the previous, current and next character, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "17">Furthermore, another one is character type feature template T-1T0T1.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "18">We use four classes of character sets which are predefined as: class N represents numbers, class L represents non-Chinese letters, class P represents punctuation labels and class C represents Chinese characters.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "19">Except for the character feature, we also employ global word feature templates.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "20">The basic idea of using global word information for CWS is to inform the supervised learner how likely it is that the subsequence can be a word candidate.108,750 words with length of one to four char acters.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "21">We get FRE features similar to the AV features.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "22">2.2 HMM revises substrings with low mar-.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "23">ginal probability The MP (short for marginal probability) of each character labeled with one of the six tags can be got separately through the basic CRF tagger.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "24">Here, B replaces ‘B’ and ‘S’ , and I represents other tags (‘B2’, ‘B3’, ‘M’, ‘E’).</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "25">So each character has corresponding new MP as defined in formula (3) and (4).</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "26">The accessor variety (AV) (Feng et al., 2005) is opted as global word feature, which is integrated into CRF successfully in literatures (Zhao and Kit, 2007b; Zhao and Kit, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "27">The AV value P ( PS B ∑ PB ) Pt (3) of a substring s is defined as: ( P P PM P 2 3 PE ) (4) AV (s) min Lav (s), Rav (s) (1) I Where ∑ Pt t S, B, B2 , B3 , M, E and Pt can be Where the left and right AV values Lav (s) calculated by using forward-backward algorithm and more details are in Lafferty et al.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "28">(2001).</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "29">and Rav (s) are defin ed, respe ctivel y, as the A low confi dent word refer s to a word with number of its distinct predecessors and the number of its distinct successors.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "30">Multiple feature templates are used to represent word candidates of various lengths identified by the AV criterion.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "31">Meanwhile, in order to alleviate the sparse data problem, we follow the feature function definition for a word candidate word boundary ambiguity which can be reflected by the MP of the first character of a word.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "32">That is, it’s a low confident word if the MP of the first character of the word is lower than a threshold (it’s an empirical value and can be obtained by experiments).</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "33">After getting the new MP, all s with a score AV (s) namely: in Zhao and Kit (2008), these low confident candidate words are recom bined with their direct predecessors until the occurrence of a word that the MP of its first fn (s) t , 2 t AV (s) 2t 1 (2) character is above the threshold , and then a In order to improve the efficiency, all candidates longer than five characters are given up.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "34">The AV features of word candidates can’t directly be utilized to direct CRF learning before being transferred to the information of characters.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "35">So we only choose the one with the greatest AV score to activate the above feature function for new substring is generated for post processing.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "36">Then, we use class-based HMM to re-segment the substrings mentioned above.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "37">Given a word ①http://ccl.pku.edu.cn/doubtfire/Course/Chinese%20Inform ation%20Processing/Source_Code/Chapter_8/Lexicon_full.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "38">zip wi, a word class ci is the word itself.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "39">Let W be the word sequence, let C be its class sequence, W # all punctuations) is half-width and the string before or after are composed of letters and numbers,combine all into a string as a whole.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "40">For an ex and let be the segment ation result with the ample, ‘.’, ‘/’, ‘:’, ‘%’ and ‘\’ are usually recog maximum likelihood.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "41">Then, a class-based HMM model (Liu, 2004) can be got.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "42">W # arg max P(W ) W = arg max P(W | C )P(C ) W m nized as split tokens.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "43">So, it needs handling additionally.</S>

	<SECTION title="Experiments results and analysis. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "1">We evaluate our system on the corpora given by CIPSSIGHAN 2010.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "2">There are four test corpora which belong to different domains.</S>

			<S sid ="63" ssid = "4">Where P(ci | ci 1 ) indicates the transitive probability from one class to another and it can be obtained from training corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "5">The word boundary of results from HMM is also represented by tag ‘B’ and ‘I’ which meaning are the same as mentioned in above.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "6">2.3 Confidence measure and post process-.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "7">ing for final result There are two segmentation results for substrings with low MP candidates after reprocessing using HMM.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "8">Analyzing experiments data, we find wrong tags labeled by CRF are mainly: OOV words in test data, IV words and incorrect words recognized by CRF.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "9">Rectifying the tags with lower MP simply may produce an even worse performance in some case.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "10">For example, some OOV words are recognized correctly by CRF but with low MP.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "11">So, we can’t accept the revised results completely.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "12">A confidence measure approach is used to resolve this problem.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "13">Its calculation is defined as: Table 1.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "14">Test corpora details A, B, C and D represent literature, computer science, medical science and finance, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "15">3.1 Closed.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "16">test The rule for the closed test in Bakeoff is that no additional information beyond training corpora is allowed.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "17">Following the rule, the closed test is designed to compare our system with other CWS systems.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "18">Five metrics of SIGHAN Bakeoff are used to evaluate the segmentation results: F-score (F), recall (R), precision (P), the recall on IV words (RIV) and the recall on OOV words (Roov).</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "19">The closed test results are presented in table 2.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "20">PC PC (1 P ) o (6) PC is the MP of the character as ‘I’, is the premium coefficient.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "21">Based on the new value, a threshold t was used, if the value was lower than t , the original tag ‘I’ will be rejected and changed into the tag ‘B’ which is labeled by HMM.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "22">Table 2.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "23">Evaluation closed results on all data sets At last, we use a simple rule to post-process the result directed at the strings that containing letters, ② In order to analyze our results, we got value of R from numbers and punctuations.</S>
