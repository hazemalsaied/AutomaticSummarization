			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Recently, Distant Supervision (DS) (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Mintz et al., 2009) has emerged to be a popular choice for training relation extractors without using manually labeled data.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">It automatically generates training examples by labeling relation mentions1 in the source corpus according to whether the argument pair is listed in the target relational tables in a knowledge base (KB).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">This method significantly reduces human efforts for relation extraction.</S>

			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Previous work typically assumes that if the argument entity pair is not listed in the KB as having a relation, all the corresponding relation mentions are considered negative examples.3 This crude assumption labeled many entity pairs as negative when in fact some of their mentions express a relation.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">The number of such false negative matches even exceeds the number of positive pairs, by 3 to 10 times, leading to a significant problem for training.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Previous approaches (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012) bypassed this problem by heavily under-sampling the “negative“ class.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">We instead deal with a learning scenario where we only have entity-pair level labels that are either positive or unlabeled.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">We proposed an extension to Surdeanu et al.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">(2012) that can train on this dataset.</S>

			<S sid ="48" ssid = "24">We further investigate the rate of false negative matches, as the percentage of entity-pairs that are not listed in Freebase but one of its mentions generated by DS does express a relation in the target set of types.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "25">We randomly picked 200 unla 5 of relational tables r(e1, e2), in which rǫR (R is the beled bags from each of the two datasets (Riedel set of relation labels), and &lt; e1, e2 &gt; is a pair of entities that is known to have relation r) and a corpus C , the key idea of distant supervision is that we align D to C , label each bag4 of relation mentionsthat share argument pair &lt; e1, e2 &gt; with r, other wise OTHER.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "26">This generates a dataset that has labels on entity-pair (bag) level.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "27">Then a relation extractor is trained with single-instance learning (by assuming all mentions have the same label as the bag), or Multiple-Instance Learning (by assuming at-least- one of the mentions expresses the bag-level label), or Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning (further assuming a bag can have multiple labels) algorithms.</S>

			<S sid ="54" ssid = "30">The result is shown in Table 2, along with a few examples that indicate a relation holds in the set of false negative matches (bag-level).</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "31">Both datasets have around 10% false negative matches in the unlabeled set of bags.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "32">Taking into consideration that the number of positive bags and unlabeled bags are highly imbalanced (1:134 and 1:37 in the Riedel and KBP dataset respectively, before under- sampling the unlabeled class), the number of false negative matches are 11 and 4 times the number of positive bags in Reidel and KBP dataset, respectively.</S>
