			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Relation extraction is to find various predefined semantic relations between pairs of entities in text.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">The research in relation extraction has been pr omoted by the Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) (MUC, 19871998) and the NIST Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program (ACE, 20022005).</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">According to the ACE Program, an entity is an object or a set of objects in the world and a relation is an explicitly or implicitly stated relationship among entities.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">For example, the sentence “Bill Gates is the chairman and chief software architect of Microsoft Corporation.” c onveys the ACE-style relation “EMPLOYMENT.exec” between the entities “Bill Gates” (person name) and “Microsoft Corporation” (organization name).</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Extraction of semantic relations between entities can be very useful in many applic a- tions such as question answering, e.g. to answer the query “Who is the president of the United States?”, and information retrieval, e.g. to expand the query “George W. Bush”with “the pres ident of the United States”via his relationship with “the United States”.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Many researches have been done in relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Among them, feature-based methods (Kambhatla 2004; Zhou et al., 2005) achieve certain success by employing a large amount of diverse linguistic features, varying from lexical knowledge, entity- related information to syntactic parse trees, dependency trees and semantic information . How ever, it is difficult for them to effectively capture struc tured parse tree information (Zhou et al 2005), which is critical for further performance improvement in relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">As an alternative to feature-based methods, tree kernel-based methods provide an elegant solution to explore implic itly structured features by directly computing the simila rity between two trees.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Although earlier researches (Zelenko et al 2003; Culotta and Sorensen 2004; Bunescu and Mooney 2005a) only achieve success on simple tasks and fail on complex tasks, such as the ACE RDC task, tree kernel-based methods achieve much progress recently.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">As the state-of-the-art, Zhang et al (2006) applied the c onvolution tree kernel (Collins and Duffy 2001) and achieved comparable performance with a state-of-the- art linear kernel (Zhou et al 2005) on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">However, there are two problems in Collins and Duffy’s convolution tree kernel for relation extrac tion.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">The first is that the sub-trees enumerated in the tree kernel computation are context-free.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">That is, each sub-tree enumerated in the tree kernel computation 728 Proceedings of the 2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning, pp.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">728–736, Prague, June 2007.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">Qc 2007 Association for Computational Linguistics does not consider the context information outside the sub-tree.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">The second is to dec ide a proper tree span in relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Zhang et al (2006) explored five tree spans in relation extraction and it was a bit surprising to find that the Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT, i.e. the sub-tree enclosed by the shortest path linking two involved entities in the parse tree) performed best.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">This is contrast to our intuition.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">For example, “got married” is critical to determine the relationship between “John” and “Mary”in the sentence “John and Mary got married… ” as shown in Figure 1(e).</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">It is obvious that the information contained in SPT (“John and Marry”) is not enough to determine their relationship.This paper proposes a context-sensitive convolu tion tree kernel for relation extraction to resolve the above two problems.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">It first automatically determines a dynamic context-sensitive tree span for relation extraction by extending the Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT) to include necessary context information outside SPT.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Then it proposes a context -sensitive convolution tree kernel, whic h not only enumerates context- free sub-trees but also context -sensitive sub-trees by considering their ancestor node paths as their contexts.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">Moreover, this paper evaluates the complementary nature of different linear kernels and tree kernels via a composite kernel.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">The layout of this paper is as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">In Section 2, we review related work in more details.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">Then, the dynamic context-sensitive tree span and the context- sensitive convolution tree ker nel are proposed in Section 3 while Section 4 shows the experimental results.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">Finally, we conclude our work in Sec tion 5.</S>

			<S sid ="35" ssid = "1">The relation extraction task was first introduced as part of the Template Element task in MUC6 and then formulated as the Template Relation task in MUC7.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "2">Since then, many methods, such as feature-based (Kambhatla 2004; Zhou et al 2005, 2006), tree kernel-based (Zelenko et al 2003; Culotta and Sorensen 2004; Bunescu and Mooney 2005a; Zhang et al 2006) and composite kernel-based (Zhao and Gris hman 2005; Zhang et al 2006), have been proposed in literature.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "3">For the feature-based methods, Kambhatla (2004) employed Maximum Entropy models to combine diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features in relation extrac tion, and achieved the F-measure of 52.8 on the 24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "4">Zhou et al (2005) further systematically explored diverse features through a linear kernel and Support Vector Machines , and achieved the F measures of 68.0 and 55.5 on the 5 relation types and the 24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "5">One problem with the feature-based methods is that they need extensive feature engineering.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "6">Another problem is that, although they can explore some structured information in the parse tree (e.g. Kambhatla (2004) used the non-terminal path c onnecting the given two entities in a parse tree while Zhou et al.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "7">(2005) introduced additional chunking features to enhance the performance), it is found difficult to well preserve structured information in the parse trees using the feature-based methods.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "8">Zhou et al (2006) further improved the performance by exploring the commonality among related classes in a class hierarchy using hierarchical learning strategy.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "9">As an alternative to the feature-based methods, the kernel-based methods (Haussler, 1999) have been proposed to implicitly explore various features in a high dimensional space by employing a kernel to calculate the similarity between two objects directly.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "10">In particular, the kernel-based methods could be very effective at reducing the burden of feature engineering for structured objects in NLP researches, e.g. the tree structure in relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "11">Zelenko et al.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "12">(2003) proposed a kernel between two parse trees, which recursively matches nodes from roots to leaves in a top-down manner . For each pair of matched nodes, a subsequence kernel on their child nodes is invoked.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "13">They achieved quite success on two simple relation extraction tasks.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "14">Culotta and Sorensen (2004) extended this work to estimate similarity between augmented dependency trees and achieved the F-measure of 45.8 on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "15">One problem with the above two tree kernels is that matched nodes must be at the same height and have the same path to the root node.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "16">Bunescu and Mooney (2005a) pr o- posed a shortest path dependency tree kernel, which just sums up the number of common word classes at each position in the two paths, and achieved the F-measure of 52.5 on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "17">They argued that the information to model a relationship between two entities can be typically captured by the shortest path between them in the dependency graph.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "18">While the shortest path may not be able to well preserve structured dependency tree information, another problem with their kernel is that the two paths should have same length.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "19">This makes it s uffer from the similar behavior with that of Culotta and Sorensen (2004): high precision but very low recall.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "20">As the state-of-the-art tree kernel-based method, Zhang et al (2006) explored various structured feature spaces and used the convolution tree kernel over parse trees (Collins and Duffy 2001) to model syntactic structured information for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "21">They achieved the F -measures of 61.9 and 63.6 on the 5 relation types of the ACE RDC 2003 corpus and the 7 relation types of the ACE RDC 2004 corpus respectively without entity-related information while the F- measure on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC2003 corpus reached 68.7 when entity-related infor mation was included in the parse tree.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "22">One problem with Collins and Duffy’s convolution tree kernel is that the sub-trees involved in the tree kernel computation are context-free, that is, they do not consider the information outside the sub-trees.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "23">This is different from the tree kernel in Culota and Sorensen (2004), where the sub-trees involved in the tree kernel computation are context -sensitive (that is, with the path from the tree root node to the sub-tree root node in consideration).</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "24">Zhang et al (2006) also showed that the widely-used Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT) performed best.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "25">One problem with SPT is that it fails to capture the contextual information outside the shortest path, which is important for relation extraction in many cases . Our random selection of 100 pos i- tive training instances from the ACE RDC 2003 training corpus shows that ~25% of the cases need contextual information outside the shortest path.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "26">Among other kernels , Bunescu and Mooney (2005b) proposed a subsequence kernel and applied it in protein interaction and ACE relation extraction tasks.In order to integrate the advantages of feature based and tree kernel-based methods, some researc hers have turned to composite kernel-based methods.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "27">Zhao and Grishman (2005) defined several feature- based composite kernels to integrate diverse features for relation extraction and achieved the F-measure of 70.4 on the 7 relation types of the ACE RDC 2004 corpus . Zhang et al (2006) proposed two composite kernels to integrate a linear kernel and Collins and Duffy’s convolution tree kernel.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "28">It achieved the F- measure of 70.9/57.2 on the 5 relation types/24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus and the F-measure of 72.1/63.6 on the 7 relation types/23 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2004 corpus.The above discussion suggests that structured in formation in the parse tree may not be fully utilized in the previous works, regardless of feature-based, tree kernel-based or composite kernel-based methods.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "29">Compared with the previous works, this paper proposes a dynamic context-sensitive tree span trying tocover necessary structured information and a c ontext more, a composite kernel is applied to combine our tree kernel and a state-of-the-art linear kernel for integrating both flat and structured features in relation extraction as well as validating their complementary nature.</S>

			<S sid ="64" ssid = "1">Kernel for Relation Extraction In this section, we first propose an algorithm to dynamically determine a proper context-sensitive tree span and then a context-sensitive convolution tree kernel for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "2">3.1 Dynamic Context-Sensitive Tree Span in. Relation Extraction A relation instance between two entities is encaps u- lated by a parse tree.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "3">Thus, it is critical to understand which portion of a parse tree is important in the tree kernel calculation.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "4">Zhang et al (2006) systematically explored seven different tree spans , including the Shortest Path -enclosed Tree (SPT) and a Context Sensitive Path-enclosed Tree1 (CSPT), and found that SPT per formed best.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "5">That is, SPT even outperforms CSPT.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "6">This is contrary to our intuition.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "7">For example, “got married” is critical to determine the relationship between “John” and “Mary” in the sentence “John and Mary got married… ” as shown in Figure 1(e), and the information contained in SPT (“John and Mary”) is not enough to determine their relationship.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "8">Obviously, context -sensitive tree spans should have the potential for better performance.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "9">One problem with the context-sensitive tree span explored in Zhang et al (2006) is that it only considers the availability of entities’siblings and fails to consider following two factors: 1) Whether is the information contained in SPT enough to determine the relationship between two entities?</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "10">It depends.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "11">In the embedded cases, SPT is enough.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "12">For example, “John’s wife” is enough to determine the relationship between “John” and “John’s wife”in the sentence “John’s wife got a good job… ”as shown in Figure 1(a) . However, SPT is not enough in the coordinated cases, e.g. to determine the relationship between “John” and “Mary” in the sentence “John and Mary got married… ”as shown in Figure 1(e).</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "13">1 CSPT means SPT extending with the 1st left sibling of.</S>

			<S sid ="78" ssid = "15">Further of entity 2.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "16">In the case of no available sibling, it moves to the parent of current node and repeat the same pro c ess until a sibling is avai lable or the root is reached.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "17">2) How can we extend SPT to include necessary context information if there is no enough information in SPT for relation extraction?</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "18">To answer the above two questions, we randomly chose 100 positive instances from the ACE RDC 2003 training data and studied their necessary tree spans.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "19">It was observed that we can classify them into 5 categories: 1) embedded (37 instances), where one sentence “John and Mary got married…”as shown in Figure 1(e); Based on the above observations, we implement an algorithm to determine the necessary tree span for the relation extract task.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "20">The idea behind the algorithm is that the necessary tree span for a relation should be determined dynamically according to its tree span category and context.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "21">Given a parsed tree and two entity is embedded in another entity, e.g. “John”and entities in consideration, ti first determin es the tree “John’s wife”as shown in Figure 1(a) ; 2) PP-linked (21 instances), where one entity is linked to another entity via PP attachment, e.g. “CEO”and “Microsoft” in the sentence “CEO of Microsoft announced … ”as shown in Figure 1(b); 3) semi-structured (15 instances), where the sentence consists of a s equence of noun phrases (including the two given entities), e.g. “Jane” and “ABC news”in the sentence “Jane, ABC news, California .” as shown in Figure 1(c); 4) descriptive (7 instances), e.g. the citizenship between “his mother” and “Lebanese” in the sentence “his mother Lebanese landed at …”as shown in Figure 1(d); 5) predicate-linked and others (19 instances, including coordinated cases), where the predicate information is necessary to determine the relationship between two entities, e.g. “John” and “Mary” in the S span category and then extends the tree span accor d- ingly.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "22">By default, we adopt the Shortest Path- enclosed Tree (SPT) as our tree span.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "23">We only expand the tree span when the tree span belongs to the “predicate-linked”category.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "24">This is based on our observation that the tree spans belonging to the “predicate-linked” category vary much syntactically and majority (~70%) of them need information outside SPT while it is quite safe (&gt;90%) to use SPT as the tree span for the remaining categories.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "25">In our alg o- rithm, the expansion is done by first moving up until a predicate-headed phrase is found and then moving down along the predicated-headed path to the predicate terminal node.</S>

			<S sid ="92" ssid = "29">A problem with our algorithm is how to determine whether an entity pair belongs to the “predicate -linked” category.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "30">In this paper, a simple method is applied by regarding the “predicate- linked” category as the default category.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "31">That is, those entity pairs, which do not belong to the four well defined and easily detected categories (i.e. embedded, PP-liked, semi-structured and descriptive), are classified into the “predicate -linked”category.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "32">Since “predicate -linked” instances only occupy ~20% of cases, this explains why SPT performs better than the Context-Sensitive Path-enclosed Tree (CSPT) as described in Zhang et al (2006): consistently adopting CSPT may introduce too much noise/unnecessary information in the tree kernel.</S>
