In this paper, the authors focus on the ACE RDC task and employ diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Their study illustrate that the base phrase chunking information contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional full parsing information does not contribute much, largely due to the fact that most of relations defined in ACE corpus are within a very short distance. They also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List can be used in the feature-based framework. Evaluation shows that the incorporation of diverse features enable their system to achieve best reported performance. This paper also explores the feature-based approach with a systematic study on the extensive incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic information. The effective incorporation of diverse features enables their system to outperform previously best- reported systems on the ACE corpus.
