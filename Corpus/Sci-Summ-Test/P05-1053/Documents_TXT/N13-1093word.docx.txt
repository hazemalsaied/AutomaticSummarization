Abstract

This paper presents an approach that exploits 
the scope of negation cues for relation extrac- 
tion (RE) without the need of using any specif- 
ically annotated dataset for building a separate 
negation scope detection classifier. New fea- 
tures are proposed which are used in two dif- 
ferent stages. These also include non-target 
entity specific features. The proposed RE ap- 
proach outperforms the previous  state of the 
art for drug-drug interaction (DDI) extraction.

1   Introduction

Negation is a linguistic phenomenon where a nega- 
tion cue (e.g. not) can alter the meaning of a partic- 
ular text segment or of a fact. This text segment (or 
fact) is said to be inside the scope of that negation 
(cue). In the context of RE, there is not much work 
that aims to exploit the scope of negations.1 The 
only work on RE that we are aware of is Sanchez- 
Graillet and Poesio (2007) where they used various 
heuristics to extract negative protein interaction.
  Despite the recent interest on automatically de- 
tecting the scope of negation2  till now there seems 
to be no empirical evidence supporting its exploita- 
tion for the purpose of RE. Even if we could man- 
age to obtain highly accurate automatically detected

1 In the context of event extraction (a closely related task of
RE), there have been efforts in BioNLP shared tasks of 2009 and
2011 for (non-mandatory sub-task of) event negation detection
(3 participants in 2009; 2 in 2011) (Kim et al., 2009; Kim et al.,
2011).  The participants approached the sub-task using either 
pre-defined patterns or some heuristics.
2 This task is popularized by various recently held shared
tasks (Farkas et al., 2010; Morante and Blanco, 2012).


negation scopes, it is not clear how to feed this infor- 
mation inside the RE approach. Simply considering 
whether a pair of candidate mentions falls under the 
scope of a negation cue might not be helpful.
  In this paper, we propose that the scope of nega- 
tions can be exploited at two different levels. Firstly, 
the system would check whether all the target en- 
tity3 mentions inside a sentence along with possible 
relation clues (or trigger words), if any, fall (directly 
or indirectly) under the scope of a negation  cue. If 
such a sentence is found, then it should be discarded 
(i.e.  candidate mention pairs4 inside that sentence 
would not be considered). Secondly, for each of the 
remaining pairs of candidate mentions, the system 
should exploit features related to the scope of nega- 
tion (rather than simply adding a feature for negation 
cue, approach adopted in various RE systems) that 
can provide indication (if any such evidence exists) 
that the corresponding relation of interest actually 
does not hold in that particular context.
  In the subsequent sections, we describe our ap- 
proach. The RE task considered is drug-drug in- 
teraction (DDI)  extraction.   The task has signifi- 
cant importance for public health safety.5 We used

  3 The target entities, for example, for DDI extraction and for 
EMP-ORG relation extraction would be {DRUG} and {PER, 
GPE, ORG} respectively. Any entity other than the target enti- 
ties (w.r.t. the particular RE task) belongs to non-target entities.
4 Candidate mention pairs for RE are taken from target entity
mentions.
     5 After the death of pop star Michael Jackson, allegedly due 
to DDI, it was reported that about 2.2 million people in USA, 
age 57 to 85, were taking potentially dangerous combinations  of 
drugs (Landau, 2009). An earlier report mentioned that deaths 
from accidental drug interactions rose 68 percent between 1999 
and 2004 (Payne, 2007).

the DDIExtraction-2011  challenge corpus (Segura- 
Bedmar et al., 2011). The official training and test 
data of the corpus contain 4,267 and 1,539 sen- 
tences, and 2,402 and 755 DDI annotations respec- 
tively.
2   Proposed Approach

2.1	Stage 1: Exploiting scope of negation to 
filter out sentences
We propose a two stage RE approach. In the first 
stage, our goal is to exploit the scope of negations 
to reduce the number of candidate mention pairs by 
discarding sentences. For this purpose, we propose 
the following features to train a binary classifier:

• has2TM: If the sentence has exactly  2 target entity 
mentions (i.e. drug mentions for DDI extraction).
• has3OrMoreTM: Whether the sentence has more 
than 2 target entity mentions.
• allTMonRight: Whether all target entity mentions 
inside the sentence appear after the negation cue.
• neitherAllTMonLeftOrRight: Whether some but not 
all target entity mentions appear after the negation 
cue.
• negCue: The negation cue itself.

• immediateGovernor:  The word on which the cue is 
directly syntactically dependent.
• nearestVerbGovernor:  The nearest verb in the de- 
pendency graph on which the cue is syntactically 
dependent.
• isVerbGovernorRoot:  Whether the nearestVerb- 
Governor is root of the dependency graph of the 
sentence.
• allTMdependentOnNVG:  Whether all  target en- 
tity   mentions are  syntactically  dependent (di- 
rectly/indirectly) on the nearestVerbGovernor.
• allButOneTMdependentOnNVG:  Whether all  but 
one target entity mentions are syntactically  depen- 
dent on the nearestVerbGovernor.
• although*PrecedeCue:   Whether  the  syntactic 
clause containing  the negation cue begins with “al- 
though / though / despite / in spite”.
• commaBeforeNextTM: Whether there is a comma in 
the text between the negation cue and the next target 
entity mention after the cue.
• commaAfterPrevTM:  Whether there is a comma  in 
the text between the previous target entity mention 
before the negation cue and the cue itself.


• sentHasBut:  Whether the sentence  contains the 
word “but”.

  The objective of the classifier is to decide whether 
all of the target entity mentions (i.e. drugs) as well as 
any possible evidence of the relation of interest (for 
which  we assume the immediate  and the nearest verb 
governors of the negation cue would be good candi- 
dates) inside the corresponding  sentence fall under 
the scope of a negation  cue in such a way that the 
sentence is unlikely to contain a DDI.
  At present, we limit  our focus only on the first 
occurrence of the following negation cues: “no”, 
“n’t” or “not”.6   In the Stage 1, any sentence that 
contains at least one DDI is considered by the clas- 
sifier  as a positive (training/test) instance. Other sen- 
tences are considered as negative instances. We rule 
out any sentence (i.e. we do not consider  as train- 
ing/test instance for the classifier that filters less in- 
formative sentences) during both training  and testing 
if any of the following conditions holds:

• The sentence contains  less than two target entity 
mentions (such sentence would not contain the re- 
lation of interest anyway).
• It has any of the following phrases – “not recom- 
mended”, “should not be” or “must not be”.7
• There is no “no”, “n’t” or “not” in the sentence.

• No target entity mention appears in the sentence af- 
ter “no”, “n’t” or “not”.

To assess the effectiveness of the proposed Stage
1 classifier, we defined a baseline classifier  that fil- 
ters any sentence that contains “no”, “n’t” or “not”.
2.2   Stage 2

Once the sentences which are likely to have no DDI 
are identified and removed, the next step is to ap- 
ply a state-of-the-art  RE approach on the remaining 
sentences. In this section, we propose a new hybrid 
kernel, KH ybrid,  for this purpose. It is defined  as 
follows:

KH ybrid  (R1, R2) = KH F  (R1, R2) + KSL
(R1, R2) + w * KP ET  (R1, R2)

  6 These cues usually occur more frequently and generally 
have larger negation scope than other negation cues.
7 These expressions often provide clues that one of the bio-
entity mentions negatively influences the level of activity of the 
other.


  Here, KH F  stands for a new feature based kernel 
(proposed in this paper) that uses a heterogeneous 
set of features. KSL stands for the Shallow Linguis- 
tic (SL) kernel proposed by Giuliano et al. (2006). 
KP ET  stands for the Path-enclosed Tree (PET) ker- 
nel (Moschitti, 2004). w is a multiplicative constant 
used for the PET kernel. It allows the hybrid kernel 
to assign more (or less) weight to the information 
obtained using tree structures depending on the cor- 
pus.
  The proposed kernel composition is valid accord- 
ing to the closure properties of kernels.  We ex- 
ploit the SVM-Light-TK  toolkit (Moschitti, 2006; 
Joachims, 1999) for kernel computation. In Stage
2, each candidate drug mention pair represents an 
instance.
2.2.1	Proposed KH F  kernel
  As mentioned earlier, this proposed kernel uses 
heterogeneous features. The first version of the het- 
erogeneous feature set (henceforth,  HF v1) com- 
bines features proposed by two previous RE works. 
The former is Zhou et al. (2005), which uses 51 dif- 
ferent features. We select the following 27 of their 
features for our feature set:

WBNULL,  WBFL,  WBF,  WBL,  WBO, 
BM1F, BM1L, AM2F, AM2L, #MB, #WB, 
CPHBNULL, CPHBFL, CPHBF, CPHBL, 
CPHBO, CPHBM1F, CPHBM1L, CPHAM2F, 
CPHAM2F, CPP, CPPH, ET12SameNP, 
ET12SamePP, ET12SameVP, PTP, PTPH

  The latter is the TPWF kernel (Chowdhury and 
Lavelli, 2012a) from which we use following fea- 
tures:

HasTriggerWord, Trigger-X, DepPattern-i, e- 
walk, v-walk

  The TPWF kernel extracts the HasTriggerWord, 
Trigger-X and DepPattern-i features  from a  sub- 
graph called reduced graph. We also follow this ap- 
proach with one minor difference. Unlike Chowd- 
hury and Lavelli (2012a), we look for trigger words 
in the whole reduced graph instead of using only the 
root of the sub-graph.
  Due to space limitation we refer the readers to 
the corresponding  papers for the description of the 
above mentioned  features and the definition of re- 
duced graph.
  

In addition, HF v1 also includes surrounding to- 
kens within the window of {-2,+2} for each candi- 
date mention. We are unaware of any available list 
of trigger words for drug-drug interaction. So, we 
created such a list.8
  We  extend  the heterogeneous  feature set by 
adding features related to the scope of negation 
(henceforth, HF v2). We use a list of 13 negation 
cues9 to search inside the reduced graph of a candi- 
date pair. If the reduced graph contains any of the 
negation  cues or their morphological variants then 
we add the following features:

• negCue: The corresponding negation cue.

• immediateNegatedWord: If the word following the 
negation cue is neither a preposition nor a “be verb”, 
then that word, otherwise the word after the next 
word.10

  Furthermore, if the corresponding matched nega- 
tion cue is either “no”, “n’t” or “not”, then we add 
additional features related to negation scope:

• bothEntDependOnImmediateGovernor: Whether 
the immediate governor (if any) of the negation cue 
is also governor of a dependency sub-tree (of the de- 
pendency graph of the corresponding sentence) that 
includes both of the candidate mentions.
• immediateGovernorIsVerbGovernor:  Whether the 
immediate governor of the negation cue is a verb.
• nearestVerbGovernor: The closest verb governor 
(i.e.  parent or grandparent inside the dependency 
graph), if any, of the negation cue.

  We further extend the heterogeneous feature set 
by adding features related to relevant non-target en- 
tities (with respect to the relation of interest; hence- 
forth, HF v3).   For the purpose  of DDI  extrac- 
tion, we deem the presence of DISEASE mentions 
(which might result as a  consequence   of a  DDI) 
can provide some clues.  So, we use a  publicly 
available state-of-the-art  disease NER system called 
BioEnEx (Chowdhury and Lavelli, 2010) to anno- 
tate the DDIExtraction-2011  challenge corpus. For

ated list of trigger words for DDI  can be downloaded from

sence, prevent, unlikely, unchanged, rarely.

“confused” from “... not to be confused ...”.


each candidate (drug) mention pair, we add the fol- 
lowing features in HF v3:

• NTEMinsideSentence:  Whether the corresponding 
sentence contains important  non-target entity men- 
tion(s) (e.g. disease for DDI).

• immediateGovernorIsVerbGovernorOfNTEM:  The 
immediate governor (if any) of the non-target entity 
mention, only if such governor is also governing  a 
dependency sub-tree that includes both of the target 
candidate entity mentions.

• nearestVerbGovernorOfNTEM:  The closest verb 
governor (if any) of the non-target entity mention, 
only if it also governs the candidate entity mentions.

• immediateGovernorIsVerbGovernorOfNTEM:
Whether the immediate governor is a verb.


3   Results and Discussion

We train a  linear SVM classifier in Stage  1 and 
tune the hyper-parameters (by doing 5-fold cross- 
validation) for obtaining maximum possible recall. 
In this way we minimize the number of false neg- 
atives  (i.e.   sentences  that contain DDIs but are 
wrongly identified  as not having any).
  During the cross-validation  experiments on the 
training  data, 334 sentences (7.83% of the total sen- 
tences) containing at least 2 drug mentions were 
identified by our proposed classifier (in Section 2.1) 
as unlikely to have any DDI and hence are candi- 
dates for discarding. Only 19 of these sentences 
were incorrectly  identified.  When we trained on 
the training data and tested on the official test data 
of DDIExtraction-2011  challenge corpus, 121 sen- 
tences (7.86% of the total test sentences) were iden- 
tified by the classifier  as candidates for discarding. 
Only 5 of them were incorrectly identified.
  Unlike Stage 1, in Stage 2 where we train the hy- 
brid kernel based RE classifier  and use it for RE (i.e. 
DDI extraction) from the test data, sentences are not 
the RE training/test instances. Instead, a RE instance 
corresponds to a candidate mention pair.
  All  the DDIs (i.e.  positive RE instances) of the 
incorrectly identified sentences in Stage 1 (i.e. the 
sentences which are incorrectly  labelled as not hav- 
ing any DDI and filtered) are automatically  consid- 
ered as false negatives during the calculation of DDI 
extraction results in Stage 2.
  

To verify  whether our proposed  hybrid kernel 
achieves state-of-the-art results without taking ben- 
efits of the output of Stage 1, we did some experi- 
ments without discarding any sentence.  These ex- 
periments are done using Zhou et al. (2005), TPWF 
kernel, SL kernel, different versions of proposed 
KH F   kernel and KH ybrid   kernel.  Table 1 shows 
the results of 5-fold cross-validation experiments 
(hyper-parameters are tuned for obtaining maximum 
F-score). As the results show, there is a gain +0.9 
points in F-score (mainly due to the boost in re- 
call) after the addition of features related to negation 
scope. There is also some minor improvement due 
to the proposed non-target entity specific features.
  We also performed (5-fold cross validation) ex- 
periments by combining the Stage 1 classifier with 
each of the Zhou et al. (2005), TPWF kernel, SL 
kernel, PET kernel, KH F  kernel and KH ybrid  kernel 
separately (only the results of KH ybrid  are reported 
in Table 1 due to space limitation).  In each case, 
there were improvements in precision, recall and F- 
score. The gain in F-score ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 
points.


P / R / F-score

Using SL kernel (Giuliano et al., 2006)	51.3 / 64.7 / 57.3

Using (Zhou et al., 2005)	58.7 / 37.1 / 45.5

Using PET kernel (Moschitti, 2004)	46.8 / 602 / 52.7

TPWF (Chowdhury and Lavelli, 2012a)	43.7 / 60.7 / 50.8

Proposed approaches

Proposed KH F  v1 	53.4 / 51.5 / 52.4
KH F  v2  (i.e. + neg scope feat.)	53.9 / 52.6 / 53.3 (+0.9)
KH F  v3  (i.e. + non-target entity feat.)	53.6 / 53.5 / 53.6 (+0.3) 
Proposed KH ybrid 	56.3 / 68.5 / 61.8
Proposed KH ybrid with Stage 1	57.3 / 69.4 / 62.8 (+1.0)


Table 1: 5-fold cross-validation results on training data.


  Table 2 reports the results of the previously pub- 
lished studies that used the same corpus. Our pro- 
posed KH ybrid    kernel obtains an F-score that is 
higher than that of the previous state of the art.
  When the Stage 1 classifier (based on negation 
scope features) is exploited before using the KH ybrid 
kernel, the F-score reaches  up to 67.4.   This is
+1.0 points higher than without exploiting the Stage
1 classifier and +1.7 higher than previous  state of



the art. We did separate experiments (also reported 
in Table 2) to assess the performance improvement 
when the output of Stage 1 is used to filter sentences 
from either training or test data only.  The results 
remain the same when only training sentences are 
filtered; while there are some improvements  when 
only test sentences are filtered. Filtering both train- 
ing and test sentences provides the larger gain which 
is statistically significant.
  Usually, the number of negative  instances in a 
corpus is much higher than that of the positive in- 
stances.  In a recent work, Chowdhury and Lavelli 
(2012b) showed that by removing less informative

Stage 1 classifier, presented in this work, also re- 
duces skewness in instance distribution. This is be- 
cause we are only removing  those sentences that are 
unlikely to contain any positive instance. So, in prin- 
ciple, the Stage 1 classifier is focused on removing 
only negative instances (although the classifier mis- 
takenly discards few positive instances, too).
  We wanted to study how the Stage 1 classifier 
would contribute if  we use it on top of the tech- 
niques that were proposed in Chowdhury and Lavelli 
(2012b) to remove LIIs. As Table 2 shows, by using 
the Stage 1 classifier along with LLI  filtering, we 
could further improve the results (+3.2 points differ- 
ence in F-score with the previous state of the art).
4   Conclusion

A major flexibility in the proposed approach is that 
it does not require  a separate dataset (which needs 
to match the genre of the text to be used for RE) 
annotated with negation scopes. Instead, the pro- 
posed Stage 1 classifier uses the RE training data 
(which do not have negation scope annotations)  to 
self-supervise itself. Various new features have been 
exploited (both in stages 1 and 2) that can provide 
strong indications of the scope of negation cues with 
respect to the relation to be extracted. The only thing 
needed is the list of possible negation cues (Morante 
(2010) includes such a comprehensive list).
  Our proposed kernel, which has a component  that 
exploits  a heterogeneous  set of features including 
negation scope and presence of non-target entities, 
already obtains better results than previous studies.

Table 2: Results obtained on the official test set of the
2011 DDI Extraction challenge. LII filtering refers to the 
techniques proposed in Chowdhury  and Lavelli (2012b) 
for reducing skewness in RE data distribution. stat. sig. in- 
dicates that the improvement of F-score, due to usage of 
Stage 1 classifier, is statistically significant (verified using 
Approximate Randomization Procedure (Noreen, 1989); 
number of iterations = 1,000, confidence level = 0.01).


The results considerably improve when possible ir- 
relevant sentences from both training and test data 
are filtered by exploiting features related to the scope 
of negations.
  In future, we would like to exploit the scope of 
more negation cues, apart from the three cues that 
are used in this study.  We believe our approach 
would help to improve RE in other genres of text 
(such as newspaper)  as well.
