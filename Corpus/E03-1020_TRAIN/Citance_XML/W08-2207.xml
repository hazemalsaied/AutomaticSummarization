			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Usinglargescaleknowledgebases,suchasWordNet(Fellbaum,1998),hasbecomea usual, often necessary,practicefor most currentNaturalLanguageProcessing(NLP) systems.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Even now, building large and rich enough knowledge bases for broad– coverage semantic processing takes a greatdeal of expensive manual effortinvolv­ing large research groups during long periods of development.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">In fact, hundreds ofpersonyearshavebeeninvestedin thedevelopment of wordnetsfor variouslan­guages(Vossen,1998).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">For example,in morethan tenyears ofmanual construction (from1995to2006,thatisfromversion1.5to3.0),WordNetpassedfrom103,445to 235,402semanticrelations1.Butthisdatadoesnotseemstoberichenoughtosupport advancedconceptbasedNLPapplicationsdirectly.It seemsthat applicationswill not scale upto workingin opendomains without moredetailed and richgeneral-purpose (andalsodomainspeci.c)semanticknowledgebuiltbyautomaticmeans.Obviously, thisfacthas severelyhamperedthe state-of-the-artofadvancedNLP applications.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">However, thePrincetonWordNetisbyfar the most widely-usedknowledgebase (Fellbaum,1998).</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Infact,WordNetisbeing used world-wideforanchoringdiffer­enttypesofsemanticknowledgeincludingwordnetsforlanguagesotherthanEnglish (Atserias etal.,2004),domainknowledge(Magnini andCavaglià,2000) or ontolo­gieslikeSUMO(Niles andPease,2001)ortheEuroWordNetTopConceptOntology (Álvez etal.,2008).</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">It contains manually codedinformation about nouns, verbs, ad­jectives andadverbs in English and is organised around the notion of a synset.A synsetisasetofwordswiththesamepart-of-speechthatcanbeinterchangedinacer­tain context.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">For example, &lt;party, political_party&gt; form a synsetbecause theycan be usedto refertothe same concept.Asynsetis oftenfurtherdescribedby agloss,in thiscase: &quot;anorganisationtogainpoliticalpower&quot;andby explicit semanticrelations to other synsets.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Fortunately,duringthelastyearstheresearchcommunityhasdevisedalargesetof innovative methods andtoolsforlarge-scale automatic acquisition oflexicalknowl­edgefrom structured and unstructured corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Among others we can mention eX­tendedWordNet(Mihalcea andMoldovan,2001),large collections of semanticpref­erences acquiredfromSemCor(Agirre andMartinez,2001,2002) or acquiredfrom British National Corpus(BNC)(McCarthy,2001), large-scaleTopicSignatures for eachsynset acquiredfromtheweb(AgirreanddelaCalle,2004)orknowledgeabout individualsfromWikipedia(Suchaneketal.,2007).Obviously,allthese semantic re­sourceshavebeenacquiredusing averydifferentset ofprocesses(Snowetal.,2006), tools and corpora.</S>

			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">However,notallavailablelargescaleresourcesencodesemanticrelationsbetween synsets.Insomecases, onlyrelationsbetweensynsets and wordshavebeen acquired.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Thisis the case oftheTopicSignatures(Agirre et al.,2000) acquiredfrom the web (AgirreanddelaCalle,2004).Thisis oneofthelargestsemanticresourceseverbuilt with around onehundred million relationsbetween synsets and semantically related 1Symmetric relations are countedonly once.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">words.2 A knowledge net or KnowNet, is an extensible, large and accurate knowledge base, whichhasbeenderivedby semanticallydisambiguating theTopicSignatures acquiredfromthe web.</S>

			<S sid ="128" ssid = "1">The initial results obtained for the different versions of KnowNet seem to be very promising, since they seem tobe of abetterquality than other availableknowledge resources encoding relationsbetween synsetsderivedfrom non-annotated sense cor­pora.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "2">We testedall these resources andthedifferent versions ofKnowNet onSemEval­2007EnglishLexicalSampleTask(CuadrosandRigau,2008a).</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "3">When comparing the ranking of thedifferentknowledge resources, thedifferent versions ofKnowNet seem tobe more robust and stable across corpora changesthan the rest of resources.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "4">Furthermore,we alsotestedtheperformanceofKnowNetwhenportedtoSpanish(as theSpanishWordNetis also integratedinto theMCR).StartingfromKnowNet10, allKnowNet versionsperformbetter than any otherknowledge resource onSpanish derivedby manual or automatic means(including theMCR)(Cuadros andRigau, 2008b).</S>
