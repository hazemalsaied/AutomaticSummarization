<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">The algorithm is based on a graph model representing words and relationships between them.</S><S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Sense clusters are iteratively computed by clustering the local graph of similar words around an ambiguous word.</S><S sid ="6" ssid = "6">This paper describes an algorithm which automatically discovers word senses from free text and maps them to the appropriate entries of existing dictionaries or taxonomies.</S><S sid ="19" ssid = "2">Based on the intuition that nouns which co-occur in a list are often semantically related, we extract contexts of the form Noun, Noun,... and/or Noun, e.g. &quot;genomic DNA from rat, mouse and dog&quot;.</S><S sid ="20" ssid = "3">Following the method in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), we build a graph in which each node represents a noun and two nodes have an edge between them if they co-occur in lists more than a given number of times 1.</S><S sid ="37" ssid = "10">To detect the different areas of meaning in our local graphs, we use a cluster algorithm for graphs (Markov clustering, MCL) developed by van Dongen (2000).</S><S sid ="72" ssid = "28">The local graph in step 1 consists of w, the ni neighbours of w and the n9 neighbours of the neighbours of w. Since in each iteration we only attempt to find the &quot;best&quot; cluster, it suffices to build a relatively small graph in 1.</S><S sid ="84" ssid = "7">We then determined the WordNet synsets which most adequately characterized the sense clusters.</S><S sid ="90" ssid = "4">This gives rise to an automatic, unsupervised word sense disambiguation algorithm which is trained on the data to be disambiguated.</S><S sid ="93" ssid = "7">Preliminary observations show that the different neighbours in Table 1 can be used to indicate with great accuracy which of the senses is being used.</S>
