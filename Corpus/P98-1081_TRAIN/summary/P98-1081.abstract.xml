	<S sid ="0">Improving Data Driven Wordclass Tagging by System Combination</S>

		<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">In this paper we examine how the differences in modelling between different data driven systems performing the same NLP task can be exploited to yield a higher accuracy than the best individual system.</S>
		<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">We do this by means of an experiment involving the task of morpho-syntactic wordclass tagging.</S>
		<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Four well-known tagger generators (Hidden Markov Model, Memory-Based, Transformation Rules and Maximum Entropy) are trained on the same corpus data.</S>
		<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">After comparison, their outputs are combined using several voting strategies and second stage classifiers.</S>
		<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">All combination taggers outperform their best component, with the best combination showing a 19.1% lower error rate than the best individual tagger.</S>
