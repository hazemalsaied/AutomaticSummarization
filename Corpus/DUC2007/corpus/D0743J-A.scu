Toksoz said.</line><line>But these GPS readings have only been taken once a year; a new system, using GPS receivers that continuously send position information, is being installed to replace the decade-old stations.</line><line>But only one station is operational.</line><line>If a network of the new monitors had been in place, Toksoz said, &quot;we might have been able to predict the quake and provide some warning.&quot;</line><line>That warning might have been anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours before the shaking began, he said, providing enough time for people to leave vulnerable buildings, and perhaps even to store water and supplies.</line><line>A real-time warning based on GPS data has never been issued, Toksoz said.</line><line>But the only similar networks of monitoring stations in the world, one in Japan and one in southern California, have shown distinct signs of some impending earthquakes when scientists have looked back at the records after a quake occurred.</line><line>&quot;People have detected precursor motions,&quot;

said Karen Lever, an International Red Cross logistical worker in the makeshift tent hospital located in Yalova's football stadium.</line><line>She spoke outside a tent in which staffers were preparing for an expected upsurge of infectious diseases.</line><line>&quot;The water will be a problem - clean water.</line><line>And sewage and disposing of bodies with all these people outside in (95-degree) heat.&quot;</line><line>Her voice trailed off.</line><line>But for many of those who did manage to get out alive after the 45-second quake that destroyed so much, the only issue was whether more people could be pulled from the wreckage.</line><line>For four days, large swaths of Izmit were forbidden to rescue workers while firefighters battled a blaze at the nation's biggest petroleum refinery.</line><line>The ruins of the shattered houses there now conceal an unknown number of dead, and, perhaps, injured.</line><line>Foreign search and rescue teams managed to find at least three people Friday, raising hopes that others may have survived underneath the collapsed buildings, despite the heat and the lack of water.</line><line>A 70-member American team that arrived on Wednesday in Izmit has been scouring the crumbled building remains one by one, with German Shepherds trained to sniff any smell of life.</line><line>Saturday another team of about 90 people will arrive.</line><line>But on the wreckage of what was once a six-story apartment building, the yellow-helmeted rescue workers could do little for the relatives of a young woman and her father, whose weak shouts had been heard until about mid afternoon.</line><line>&quot;Make a sound, any sound!&quot; shouted the aid team's Turkish translator, kneeling over a small hole between two huge slabs of concrete.</line><line>&quot;With whatever strength you still have scream, please scream, scream!&quot; she cried, while a sensitive microphone was dangled into the hole.</line><line>Within a few minutes one of the rescue workers turned toward the dozens of anxious Turks who were waiting across the street.</line><line>&quot;This machine will pick up anything, heartbeats, breathing, and there's no real indication that there's anything down there - we're not going to stay here,&quot; Daniel Bickham announced to the crowd.</line><line>But the pleas of a young Turkish soldier - who had heard some sounds just a few hours earlier - convinced the team to give it one more try.</line><line>Two hours later, the rescue workers finally walked away, leaving behind the anguished cries of onlookers and what rescue workers were certain were two corpses buried in the rubble.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="37"/></line><line>It was the same scene on Yalova's Stadium Street, now devoid of the apartment buildings where hundreds of families had lived before 3:04 a.m. Tuesday.</line><line>For 10 minues, French rescue workers and Turkish volunteers stopped working to huddle together in total silence, straining to hear anything from their delicate microphones.</line><line>After a few minutes, they stood back from the rubble, their heads shaking.</line><line>On one street in Izmit, not even the rumble of bulldozers ripping through concrete and crushed furniture could convince 26-year-old Ilkay Yildiz that his 20-year-old fiance with the long brown hair and quick smile was dead.</line><line>Every day since the quake he has been waiting at the edge of the rubble for Hacer Subasi to appear.</line><line>Even after the foreign rescue team left a day earlier - convinced that there was nobody left to save - and the bulldozer started digging for corpses, Yildiz refuses to move.</line><line>&quot;She is the most beautiful, wonderful girl in the world and she cannot be dead,&quot; he murmured, falling to the ground and beginning to cry.</line></document><document name="XIE19990817.0107"><line>Some 27 aftershocks have jolted western Turkey in the past several hours after a strong earthquake rocked the area early in the day, Turkish news reports said mid Tuesday.<annotation scu-count="2" sum-count="9" sums="36,38,40,41,43,44,47,53,55"><scu uid="7" label="The earthquakes hit early in the morning" weight="3"/><scu uid="12" label="The quakes were followed by many aftershocks" weight="1"/></annotation></line><line>The most powerful one of the aftershocks, with a magnitude of five degrees, occurred at 12:02 local time (0902 GMT).</line><line>Another three aftershocks were measured at over four degrees on the Richter scale, the Anatolia News Agency reported.</line><line>At least 600 people have been confirmed dead and thousands of others injured in the 6.7-degree earthquake which ripped through western Turkey at 3:00 am (0000 GMT).<annotation scu-count="4" sum-count="3" sums="43,44,55"><scu uid="18" label="The death toll was enormous." weight="4"/><scu uid="20" label="Thousands were injured." weight="4"/><scu uid="7" label="The earthquakes hit early in the morning" weight="3"/><scu uid="15" label="The earthquakes were massive" weight="1"/></annotation></line><line>The epicenter is located at about 70 kilometers southeast of Istanbul, near the industrial city of Izmit in north-western Turkey.<annotation scu-count="2" sum-count="1" sums="55"><scu uid="5" label="Earthquakes hit Izmit." weight="3"/><scu uid="14" label="The earthquakes hit southeast of Istanbul" weight="2"/></annotation></line><line>The number of casualties may still increase as the rescue workers are continuing sifting through piles of rubble of the collapsed buildings in the tremor-hit cities in search for survivors and the bodies of the dead.</line><line>Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Interior Minister Saadettin Tantan have arrived at the sites to inspect the situation.</line><line>Heavily crowded Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, is the hardest hit one in the jolt and 107 bodies have been recovered in the debris and the injury toll have been put at onking Adapazari and the center of Izmit was destroyed and an area near Istanbul Ataturk Airport was seriously hit by the earthquake.<annotation scu-count="4" sum-count="2" sums="42,49"><scu uid="18" label="The death toll was enormous." weight="4"/><scu uid="20" label="Thousands were injured." weight="4"/><scu uid="30" label="Adapazari was one of the worst affected" weight="1"/><scu uid="29" label="Izmit was one of the worst affected." weight="1"/></annotation></line><line>Traffic jams and accidents have rocketed along the highways near the quake-stricken area as people are driving cars to flee the area.</line><line>Israel and Germany have announced to dispatch aid groups to the quake-stricken areas, Turkish media reports said.</line><line>Israel has announced to send a 120-staff rescue group of medical workers and German and injuring over 1,500 in and around the southern city of Adana.</line></document><document name="XIE19990818.0016"><line>The United States offered help to Turkey on Tuesday after a severe earthquake there killed hundreds of people.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="4" sums="38,39,46,52"><scu uid="18" label="The death toll was enormous." weight="4"/></annotation></line><line>President Bill Clinton said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.
