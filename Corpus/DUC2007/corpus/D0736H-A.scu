the man yelled.</line><line>&quot;You are not supposed to think.</line><line>You are mine.&quot;</line><line>It wasn't a dream.</line><line>Nor was it a scene from Winfrey's new movie &quot;Beloved,&quot; which is about slavery.</line><line>This was real.</line><line>Well, sort of real.</line><line>To research her role as Sethe, a former slave, Winfrey had turned to a Maryland company that stages slave-master re-enactments.</line><line>Blindfolded and taken by wagon deep into the woods at dawn on a hot morning in summer 1997, Winfrey spent the day being harassed by various &quot;masters,&quot; unable to see, run or defend herself.</line><line>&quot;What I remember is that I started crying hysterically,&quot; Winfrey recalls.</line><line>&quot;I just felt shock waves of pain.</line><line>I felt hollow darkness and howling agony.</line><line>I touched that thing, that place of what it was like to be a slave.&quot;</line><line>It's a long time and a long way from that day, as Winfrey relaxes for an interview at Chicago's Four Seasons Hotel.</line><line>&quot;Beloved&quot; is due to open Oct. 16, and its producer/star is strikingly thin and radiant in a billowing, floor-length, black-crepe skirt and matching sweater.</line><line>She may be relaxed, though, but she's anything but comfortable with the memory.</line><line>&quot;Many times I thought, 'OK, just take the blindfold off and tell them that it's over.</line><line>Enough of this,'&quot; Winfrey admits.</line><line>&quot;Then I would say to myself, 'This is what I need to feel to do the movie.</line><line>I must know the pain of belonging to someone else.'&quot;</line><line>If it sounds like this isn't just another movie, that's understandable.</line><line>Winfrey had fought to bring &quot;Beloved&quot; to the screen since 1987, but actually making the film was even more harrowing than getting it made.</line><line>&quot;I am not the same person after this movie,&quot; Winfrey says.</line><line>&quot;I came out of it fearless, and my entire life I have been a very fearful woman.</line><line>I've been fearful of everything.</line><line>That's what my weight issues were about - repressed fear.</line><line>&quot;Now I know I come from a people who had no shoes, but they said, 'I will run on,'&quot; she says.</line><line>&quot;I come from people who said, 'Don't know which way north is, but I will find it.'</line><line>They said, 'Don't know if I can swim when I get to the Ohio River, but I'll find a way.'</line><line>&quot;Now I know what my people always knew,&quot; she concludes, &quot;which is that you have to look inside yourself and find the spirit to say, 'I am better than this.'</line><line>To me that is the ultimate fearlessness.&quot;</line><line>It's been 11 years since the talk-show host first read Toni Morrison's novel, on which the movie is based.</line><line>She couldn't put down the mystical story of Sethe, who kills one of her daughters to spare her the horrors of slavery, only to be haunted by her apparent reappearance years later.</line><line>&quot;I was taken in,&quot; she recalls.</line><line>&quot;I felt absorbed by it.</line><line>I felt I was in the interior of the words.&quot;</line><line>The moment she finished the book, Winfrey tried to contact Morrison about the film rights.</line><line>But it was a weekend, and she couldn't get the author's phone number.</line><line>&quot;I scanned the back of the book to find the town she lived in, and I ended up calling the fire department and asking them to please call Toni and say Oprah wants to talk to her,&quot; Winfrey recalls.</line><line>Morrison did indeed call back, but she laughed at the idea of &quot;Beloved&quot; ever being filmable.</line><line>&quot;I believe I can do it,&quot; Winfrey told her.</line><line>&quot;In fact, I know I can.</line><line>I just need you to trust me.&quot;</line><line>That trust was strained over the next decade, as producer Winfrey struggled to find the right director for the project.</line><line>Finally, she settled on Jonathan Demme, director of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991) and &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993).</line><line>She was nervous about approaching the Oscar-winning director, but as it turns out he was equally edgy.</line><line>&quot;I was the one who was so nervous,&quot; he recalls in a separate interview.</line><line>&quot;I was having dinner at Oprah's house, and I wanted to make this movie so badly.&quot;</line><line>That night, Demme says, they discussed Winfrey's biggest concern: &quot;Oprah was worried that she was too well-known for audiences to accept her as this 19th-century farm woman.&quot;</line><line>Actually, Winfrey - who has acted in only a handful of roles in films and television - had a series of worries.</line><line>For example, for the first time she would be required to do a love scene.</line><line>It helped that cast opposite her was Danny Glover, with whom she had worked - and earned an Oscar nomination - in &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1985).</line><line>&quot;Oprah did have all this anxiety about the love scenes,&quot; Glover says in a separate interview.</line><line>&quot;I whispered to her, 'I don't care if we're 44 and 50 years old.</line><line>Let's just pretend we're 17 and doing it for the first time for real.'&quot;</line><line>&quot;I was a wreck,&quot; Winfrey says, laughing.</line><line>&quot;I asked one of the dressers to please get me some lemons to suck on.</line><line>I hear lemons give you fresh breath.&quot;</line><line>In the end, Glover says, &quot;We made each other feel safe, and when I looked in Oprah's eyes, all I could see was the truth.&quot;</line><line>Winfrey did draw the line at nudity, however.</line><line>&quot;I said, 'Excuse me, Jonathan, I have breasts that flatten out when I lie down,'&quot; she says, laughing.</line><line>&quot;'If you want breasts, we gotta go call Naomi Campbell.</line><line>Stunt breasts!'&quot;</line><line>Demme relented, and the scene was excised.</line><line>On the whole, however, Winfrey reveled in her first role since the 1989 television movie, &quot;The Women of Brewster Place.&quot;<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="50"/></line><line>&quot;I actually had an out-of-body moment the first day of filming,&quot; she recalls.</line><line>&quot;I was literally flying out of my body and floating out of myself the first time Danny Glover walked up to Sethe's front porch.</line><line>I kept whispering to myself, 'I read the book.</line><line>I dreamt the movie.</line><line>And now I can't believe this is really happening.'&quot;</line><line>To hear her talk, it won't be another nine years before Winfrey tackles her next role.</line><line>&quot;My father once equated actresses with strippers,&quot; she says.</line><line>&quot;He told me, 'No self-respecting woman goes into that profession.'</line><line>&quot;Acting for me is the ultimate in compassion and empathy,&quot; the television star says.</line><line>&quot;Ultimately you've got to give yourself up.</line><line>You've got to lose yourself, step into somebody else's life and absorb it.</line><line>I love it.&quot;</line><line>Already, there is talk of a second Oscar nomination.</line><line>Winfrey smiles, but won't discuss her chances.</line><line>&quot;All awards are is a confirmation that your work mattered as much to somebody else as it mattered to you,&quot; she says.</line><line>&quot;They just say, 'Yeah, you did OK.'</line><line>That's what an Oscar would mean to me.&quot;</line><line>In the meantime, Winfrey will continue with her usual routine as host/executive producer of one of the most popular shows in television history, balancing the pressures of the business world with exercise - she intends to keep her weight down this time - and daily meditation.</line><line>&quot;I believe there is a force bigger than myself,&quot; she says.</line><line>&quot;I call it God.</line><line>I try to align myself with the force bigger than me every morning, so I open myself up to the possibilities.&quot; c.1998 Cindy Pearlman (To publish this article, it must be purchased - the rate is not prohibitive - from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or by fax at 816-822-1444.)</line></document><document name="NYT19981006.0278"><line>Oprah Winfrey 's at the top of her form right now: Her movie, &quot;Beloved,&quot;
