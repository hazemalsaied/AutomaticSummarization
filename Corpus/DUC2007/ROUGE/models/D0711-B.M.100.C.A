In November 1999 in a finding of fact, the judge in the federal antitrust suit against Microsoft ruled that the defendant had abused its power and harmed consumers.
The judge's ruling was followed by settlement talks which, after four months, ended with the government's rejection of Microsoft's offer.
In closing arguments before the judge's finding of law, a representative of the states joined in the suit stated that "Microsoft has used virtually every tool of the monopolist's trade--attempted collusion, exclusionary contracts, tying, predation--in a coordinated scheme to eliminate threats to its monopoly."
