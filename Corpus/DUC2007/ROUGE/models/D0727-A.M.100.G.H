Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, resigned from his House seat on January 6, 1999.
In July 1999, he filed for divorce, prompting a series of claims and counterclaims between him and his wife over personal affairs and assets.
Mrs. Gingrich also served notice to depose Callista Bisek with whom Mr. Gingrich has been having an affair for several years.
In September 1999, the Gingriches reached an agreement on dividing their assets.
Mrs. Gingrich filed requests to depose several of her husband's close friends and advisers.
Ms. Bisek filed a request to overturn the requirement for her to answer questions.
