Democrat Al Gore took his first formal step in running for president in 2000 by notifying the Federal Election Commission in late December 1998 that he had formed a campaign organization.
Gore faced the delicate problem of distinguishing himself from President Clinton without appearing disloyal.
Some Democrats wanted Gore to criticized Clinton's conduct.
Polls indicated that most Americans were pleased with Gore's performance as vice-president, but did not see him as a strong leader.
In early 1999, Gore opened a campaign headquarters in Washington, raised campaign funds, made appointments to his campaign staff, and campaigned in New Hampshire.
