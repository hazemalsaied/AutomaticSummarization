Newt called on Marianne Gingrich to sit for a videotaped deposition and to account for all the couple's cash and stocks, claiming she had violated their confidential agreement.
Marianne and the accountant for the couple's joint account denied Newt's charge and the agreement was released to the public.
After a judge ruled on appeal that Bisek must testify, Newt announced that he would question her.
Bisek admitted to their 6-year affair but refused to answer a subpoena from Marianne's attorney demanding various letters and documents.
The matter was referred to a judge for decision on Nov. 23.
