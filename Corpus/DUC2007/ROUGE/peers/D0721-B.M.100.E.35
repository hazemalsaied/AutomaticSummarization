LARAMIE, Wyo.
(AP) -- A man testified he was angered by a sexual advance by gay college student Matthew Shepard inside the same bar that Shepard later met up with his alleged killers.
Michael St. Clair was the first defense witness called in the murder trial of Aaron McKinney.
The defense opened its case Friday.
McKinney, 22, is charged with robbery, kidnapping and murder, and could be sentenced to death if convicted.
His attorneys are trying to convince the jury McKinney is guilty of manslaughter rather than murder.
