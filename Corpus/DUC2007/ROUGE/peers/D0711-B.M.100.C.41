In its closing argument in the Microsoft trial, the government said Tuesday that it is ``simply impossible to imagine'' that the company will not be found to have violated the nation's antitrust laws, based on the mountains of courtroom evidence.
Boies opened his remarks by stressing that the Supreme Court has long recognized that antitrust cases are ``especially fact-based cases''.
And throughout his presentation, he repeatedly made reference to the judge's findings of fact, which sided so emphatically with the government, using phrases like ``the court has found,'' ``the evidence shows'' and ``Microsoft's own witnesses and documents show.''
