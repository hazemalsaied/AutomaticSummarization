Russell Henderson's decision to plead guilty to the kidnapping and murder of Matthew Shepard is little consolation to the Shepard family, but it provides an appropriately severe sentence for one whose apparent anti-gay hatred led him to destroy a young life.
The fact remains that anti-gay violence accounted for more than 1,100 reported hate crimes in this country in 1997, according to the latest FBI figures.
The conviction of one man and the trial of another for his murder are appropriate responses to this criminal act.
He received two life sentences.
