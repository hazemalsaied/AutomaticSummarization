ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 26,000 survivors of the August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake.
This is expected to push Turkey's economy this year into a gross domestic product loss, or "negative growth." The United States has military facilities in several parts of Turkey, including at the air base in Incirlik in the east of the country used for U.S. warplanes patrolling over the imposed no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
