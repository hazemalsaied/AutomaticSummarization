The Australian federal government rejected a UNESCO report which called for Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka uranium mine.
Hill said Australia's response to the report "clearly demonstrated that there is no basis to including Kakadu Park on the in-danger list".
Australia's conservative government defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka within the park.
Environment Minister Robert Hill said he would compile a comprehensive rebuttal of the UNESCO report.
