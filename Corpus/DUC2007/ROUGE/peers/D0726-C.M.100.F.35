STAMFORD, Conn.
(AP) - A Stamford woman has become the official yarmulke maker of the Gore-Lieberman presidential ticket.
After hearing that Stamford-native Lieberman had been chosen as Al Gore's running mate, Marsha Greenberg decided to knit him a gift.
The end result was a blue yarmulke with red and white striped letters reading, ''Gore-Lieberman 2000''.
A yarmulke is a skull cap worn by Jewish males as a sign of humility before God.
''As the first Orthodox Jew who's gotten so far, I knew he would wear it if I could get it to him,'' she said.
''It's the campaign yarmulke''.
