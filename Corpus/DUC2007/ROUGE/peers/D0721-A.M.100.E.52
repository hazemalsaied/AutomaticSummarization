Henderson has pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping in the death of Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who was lured from a bar in October and fatally beaten.
Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she and her husband "want to allow justice to run its course." What remains as certain now as on Oct. 12, the day Matthew died, is that this murder happened against the backdrop of a campaign in which the far right, abetted by political leaders like Trent Lott, was demonizing gay people as sick and sinful.
