A judge today barred defense lawyers from using a ``gay panic'' defense in the murder trial of a man accused of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard.
A U.S. man convicted of killing a gay college student was sentenced Thursday to life imprisonment.
Flanked by Republican lawmakers, the father of Matthew Shepard, a college student whose beating death stemmed from the fact that he was a homosexual, urged Congress Monday to adopt legislation that would extend federal hate-crime protection to gays and lesbians.
