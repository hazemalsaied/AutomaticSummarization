Legal experts gave the judge in the Microsoft case high marks Thursday for his handling of the case, saying he took some risks but grounded his ruling in fundamental principles governing fair competition.
They said the actions of the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had made it more difficult for Microsoft to suggest that the computer industry ought to be given more leeway than traditional businesses under antitrust law.
``It reminds people that there are antitrust laws out there,'' said George A. Hay, a professor of antitrust law at Cornell Law School.
