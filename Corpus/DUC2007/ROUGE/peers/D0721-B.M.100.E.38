About 600 people gathered Sunday night for a candelight vigil honoring Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was fatally beaten and tied to a post a year ago.
Gay college student Matthew Shepard was pummeled to death by Aaron McKinney in a drunken, drug-induced rage after Shepard made a pass at him, McKinney's attorney said Monday as his trial began.
Matthew Shepard was struck at least 20 times, the blows raining down so hard that they fractured his skull a half-dozen times, a coroner testified today.
