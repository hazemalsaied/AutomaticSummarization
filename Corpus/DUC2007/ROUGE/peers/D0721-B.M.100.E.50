Jeremy Herrera, 19, said McKinney was arguing with Emiliano Morales III when McKinney went to his truck, pulled out a gun and hit Morales from behind.
Shepard, 21, was beaten more than 20 times on the head with a.357-magnum handgun, tied to a fence on an isolated prairie road and left to die.
The jury of 12 and four alternates heard a different rationale for the killing from Cal Rerucha, the prosecutor for Albany County, who said that McKinney and a friend, Russell Henderson, fully intended to murder Shepard after kidnapping him and robbing him of $20 .
