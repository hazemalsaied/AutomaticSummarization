A judge has issued a gag order for lawyers involved in the Matthew Shepard murder trial, saying they "gravely injured" the defendant's right to a fair trial.
A prosecutor asked 71 prospective jurors to set aside the emotions of pity and rage if chosen for the trial in the death of gay college student Shepard.
Escaping a possible death sentence, Russell Henderson was sentenced by District Judge Jeffrey Donnell for his part in the beating and murder of the student, Shepard.
Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she and her husband want to allow justice to run
