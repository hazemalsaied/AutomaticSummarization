Catherine ``Kiki'' Moore, who worked for the 1992 and 1996 Clinton-Gore campaigns, will fill the empty press secretary slot at Gore 2000 starting Sept. 7, campaign general chairman Tony Coelho said.
Gore's warnings came as his presidential campaign launched ``Ganamos con Gore'' (''We win with Gore''), a nationwide effort to build on the political organizations of the nearly 600 Hispanic elected officials and community leaders who endorsed the vice president Tuesday.
U.S. Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday that he is moving his campaign to State of Tennessee.
