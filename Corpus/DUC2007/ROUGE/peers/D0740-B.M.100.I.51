Pilots Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland have flown further than any balloonist before, traveling more than 21,625 miles after leaving the Swiss Alps.
British balloonists Colin Prescot and Andy Elson gave up over the Pacific last Sunday after having to detour south because they lacked Chinese permission.
Two British balloonists abandoned their attempt because of bad weather, landing in the Pacific near Japan.
Piccard, who had to abandon an attempt last year because he failed to receive permission to cross China, delayed his departure from Switzerland this year until he got Beijing's approval.
