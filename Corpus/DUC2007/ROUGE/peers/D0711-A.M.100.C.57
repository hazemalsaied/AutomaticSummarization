Microsoft fiercely denies the allegation.
The testimony last week of Garry Norris of IBM supplied some of the most absorbing moments so far in the Microsoft trial.
Ibm turned down the Microsoft proposal.
A shrewdly devised offer by Microsoft perhaps, but antitrust experts say it was probably not a violation.
The Norris testimony went well beyond the OS/2 charge.
To protect confidential commercial information, Judge Jackson took that testimony in closed sessions.
If the industry pricing information shows that IBM was paying more than comparable PC makers, the Norris testimony may add more legal ammunition to the government's case.
