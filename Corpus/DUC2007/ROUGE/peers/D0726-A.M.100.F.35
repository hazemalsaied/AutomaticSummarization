MONTGOMERY, Ohio (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore commiserated with those who lost their homes and businesses when a killer tornado tore through suburban Cincinnati earlier this month.
``I was truly inspired by the way everybody pulled together, neighbors helping neighbors,'' Gore said Monday.
``I was not fully prepared for how much damage there was''.
The vice president visited the areas worst hit when a pre-dawn twister with 200-mph winds carved a narrow path through affluent subdivisions in Montgomery, Blue Ash and other communities on April 9.
Four people died.
