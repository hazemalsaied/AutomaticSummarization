Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Freedom of the City honor Saturday night in recognition of her activism in her Southeast Asian country.
''Aung San Suu Kyi was chosen for this award because of her long courageous stand in support of democracy in Burma,'' said Dublin's Lord Mayor Mary Freehill.
According to official statistics, more than 500 members from various anti-government armed groups "exchanged arms for peace" with the government last year.
Up to now, 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups as well as the MTA have made peace with the government.
