Some 27 aftershocks have jolted western Turkey in the past several hours after a strong earthquake rocked the area early in the day, Turkish news reports said mid Tuesday.
Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the fault line that ruptured in Turkey Tuesday, producing a devastating earthquake, had been identified more than two years ago as a particularly dangerous one.
The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Turkey has risen to 7,085, with 33,559 injured, the government crisis center said early Friday, two days after the quake hit the northwestern part of the country.
