Tangeman told the jury, McKinney "becomes very, very upset and beats Matthew Shepard" prompted by memories of a sexual encounter forced upon him by an older boy when he was 7.
Aaron J. McKinney killed a gay student at the University of Wyoming last year in "a five-minute emotional rage" because the student, Shepard, had made sexual advances that reminded him of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child, McKinney's lawyer told a jury as his murder trial began here.
Jurors saw photographs of Shepard's bloody face as prosecutors began presenting their case against Aaron McKinney, accused of beating.
