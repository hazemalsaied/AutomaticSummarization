The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
Burma, persists in its disregard for political and human rights.
Nearly 200 elected lawmakers are among those who have been arrested.
According to official statistics, more than 500 members from various anti-government armed groups "exchanged arms for peace" with the government.
Although noninterference in the internal affairs of member states is a founding principle of ASEAN, the cross-border flow of narcotics, HIV, and refugees into Thailand demonstrates the folly of pretending that Burma's ASEAN neighbors are not affected by the junta's misrule.
