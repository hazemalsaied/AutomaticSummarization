The Australian: -- The Australian government's environmental report on Jabiluka uranium mine (located in Kakadu Natural Park), to be released Thursday, found area is not under threat and attacked a UNESCO report that said Kakadu Natural Park was in danger.
Hill said Australia's response to report "clearly demonstrated that there is no basis to including Kakadu National Park on in-danger list".
The findings of mission report were inconsistent with fact Ranger uranium mine, less than 20 km from Jabiluka had operated for 20 years with no adverse impact on Kakadu.
