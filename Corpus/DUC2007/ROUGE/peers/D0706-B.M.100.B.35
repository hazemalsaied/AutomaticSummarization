YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- The United States and European countries were rebuked Tuesday for passing up an international heroin conference because it was in Myanmar, one of the world's biggest producers of the drug.
Participants at the 4th International Heroin Conference said the boycott by the world's biggest heroin consuming nations ran counter to the spirit of international cooperation against drug trafficking.
