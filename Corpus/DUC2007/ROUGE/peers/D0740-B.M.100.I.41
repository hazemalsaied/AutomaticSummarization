Besides the vagaries of wind direction and speed, there were storms to avoid and regions of dead air where the balloon might have become stuck until fuel ran out.
On two occasions, prompted partly by the need to scrape ice off burners and partly to escape the bad-smelling air inside the crew capsule, the balloonists ventured outside their pressurized crew compartment into the frigid, thin air above 20,000 feet.
The pilots now hope to land further west, in Morocco.
If the two make it, the pair will have conquered one of the last great tests facing balloonists.
