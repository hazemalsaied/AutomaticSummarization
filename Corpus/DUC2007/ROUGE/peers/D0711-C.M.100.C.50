A U.S. federal judge ordered Wednesday Microsoft Corp. to be split in two separate companies to correct antitrust violations.
District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has gone along with the government recommendation that the software giant be split in two, one that would sell operating systems, and another that would develop and market Microsoft's popular Office software and Internet properties.
If the judgment is upheld, it would be the harshest antitrust penalty leveled against a U.S. corporation since AT&T agreed to spin off the "baby bell" regional phone companies in 1982.
