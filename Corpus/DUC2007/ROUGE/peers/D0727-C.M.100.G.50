A court-appointed mediator who spent 12 hours negotiating a settlement agreement between the Gingriches filed her report Friday, saying the couple came to a "full settlement" early that morning.
Gingrich will marry Callista Bisek on Aug. 18 in Alexandria, Va., said Randy Evans, the former House speaker's personal lawyer.
Gingrich filed for divorce July 19, 1999, six months after resigning the 6th District seat he held in Congress for 20 years, and from the speakership he won in 1994 after leading House Republicans to their first majority in 40 years.
