The prospect that Breitling's crew, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, may succeed where all others have failed seemed more promising with each passing hour.
The Breitling ground team in Geneva forecast that huge Swiss-registered balloon would complete its circuit of Earth on Saturday, somewhere in North Africa.
The Breitling balloon faced staggering problems to get this far.
China gave last-minute permission, but only on condition that balloon remain south of 26th parallel.
Sometimes balloon crawled at 20 miles an hour, but in stretches where crew could exploit jet streams, Breitling sped at more than 100 miles an hour.
