A number of countries are already planning to hold the euro as part of their foreign currency reserves, the magazine quoted European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg.
European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said that Europe's new single currency, the euro, won't compete with the U.S. dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves.
In order to seize the opportunity to share in the start up of the euro, which is scheduled for 01/01/1999, the Bulgarian government adopted a system of monetary commission on 07/01/1997, and established a connection between the Bulgarian lev and the German mark.
