Aaron McKinney, accused of the fatal beating of gay college student Matthew Shepard, pulled out a gun and clubbed another man hours after Shepard was attacked, a teen-ager testified Tuesday.
Aaron J. McKinney killed a gay student at the University of Wyoming last year in ``a five-minute emotional rage'' because the student, Matthew Shepard, had made sexual advances that reminded him of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child, McKinney's lawyer told a jury on Monday as his [Aaron J. McKinney] murder trial began here.
