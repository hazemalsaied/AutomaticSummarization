WASHINGTON, September 29, 1999 (Xinhua ) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday that he is moving his campaign to State of Tennessee.
He was chief of staff for Attorney General Janet Reno before becoming Gore's chief of staff nearly four years ago.
Vice President Al Gore received the endorsement of his boss' wife June 1, 1999 as he sought to rally women behind his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
By a 50 percent to 32 percent margin, they said they were less likely to vote for Gore if Clinton actively supports and campaigns for him.
