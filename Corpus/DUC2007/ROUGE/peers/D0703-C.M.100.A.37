"Romania's Central Bank (BNR) and country's commercial banks fear little about introduction of euro and will easily adapt to it," BNR Foreign Currency Director George Mucibabici told a recent colloquium on euro in Bucharest.
BNR and Romanian commercial banks that want to perform euro services will have to open accounts in euro by January 4, 1999, first scheduled day of euro use, and inform their foreign partners.
BNR indicative exchange rates will be modified to include euro instead of current European single currency, ECU.
The daily exchange rates released by central bank would include single currency, too, he said.
