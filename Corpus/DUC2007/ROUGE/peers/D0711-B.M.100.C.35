WASHINGTON _ After reviewing a last-ditch settlement proposal offered by Microsoft Friday night, lawyers for the government concluded that it was inadequate to settle the landmark antitrust case against the software giant, officials said Saturday afternoon.
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has told both sides that, barring a settlement, he will issue a verdict in the case as soon as Tuesday, and no one doubts that he will find Microsoft in broad violation of antitrust law.
Jackson met with lawyers for both sides Tuesday and gave them a week to settle the case before he issued a verdict.
