A rowdy group of protesters was ejected from uranium miner's annual general.
An old car dressed up to look like a frill-necked lizard blocked the entrance to the Jabiluka uranium mine site inside the borders of Kakadu National Park.
The Australian branch of the International Council on Monuments and Sites said the impact on archaeological.
ERA and Australia's government claim will not hurt the park.
If listed as in danger, Kakadu would join the likes of the old city of Jerusalem, Cambodia's Angkor temples, and the war-torn cities of Dubrovnik in Croatia and Timbuktu in the African state of Mali.
