The Breitling Orbiter 3, the first manned balloon ever to make a non-stop trip around the earth, will be permanently housed at the Air and Space Museum in Washington, its owners have announced.
Walton Ferrell, a spokesman for the Air and Space Museum, said the balloon would arrive in Washington this autumn.
Thereafter, the capsule and most of the balloon will be presented to the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum.
Parts of the balloon envelope will be kept in Switzerland.
