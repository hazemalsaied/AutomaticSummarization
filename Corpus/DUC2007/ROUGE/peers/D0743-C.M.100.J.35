ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 26,000 survivors of the August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake.
Turkey's Daily News reported on Thursday that an additional 150, 000 people live in cramped prefabricated homes that are extremely hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter.
Some victims who survived the disaster complained about their grievance, saying that "the state doesn't care about us".
