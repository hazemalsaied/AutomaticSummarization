CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia faces international embarrassment over Jabiluka uranium mine, with a U.N. committee Wednesday demanding mine be scrapped to prevent it endangering surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area.
"The mission has concluded that Kakadu National Park is exposed to a number of serious threats which are placing it under both ascertained and potential danger," bureau said in a report after it sent a mission to Australia to examine claims by conservation groups that Kakadu (National Park in Northern Territory) was under threat from Jabiluka.
