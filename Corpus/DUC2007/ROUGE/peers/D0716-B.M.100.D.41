"The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed." The finding was hailed by traditional owners and green groups as a great victory, but Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as biased and unbalanced and said the mine would go ahead, according to Australian Associated Press.
He said he was astonished the report could call for the scrapping of Jabiluka because of its perceived threat to Kakadu, but did not object to the nearby Ranger mine, which had been operating for 18 years.
