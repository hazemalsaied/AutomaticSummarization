ISTANBUL (Turkey), August 21 (Xinhua) -- Blaze in a refinery in western Turkey has been under control after strong efforts made by foreign rescue experts, a Turkish official said on Saturday.
Two hours later, rescue workers finally walked away, leaving behind anguished cries of onlookers and what rescue workers were certain were two corpses buried in rubble.
Turkey and Israel have forged a strong strategic partnership over last few years, and Israel is evidently anxious to show that it can be a good friend when Turkey is in need.
Turkey sits atop some of world's most unstable geology.
