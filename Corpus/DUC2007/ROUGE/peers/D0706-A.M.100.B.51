the military has arrested more than 300 of members of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, to prevent it from convening the parliament elected in 1990.
the U.S. government issued a statement condemning the threat to deport Suu Kyi and the arrest of her party members.
Though the anniversary passed quietly, there could be stepped-up activity by the opposition, led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi offered to end her road side standoff with the military government if the government agrees to release jailed members of her political party.
