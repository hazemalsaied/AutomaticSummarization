The earthquake that struck western Turkey earlier this week was made up of two consecutive quakes, a leading geologist said Sunday.
Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist with the U.S Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said it is common for large earthquakes to occur in multiple surges in rapid succession.
``Almost every earthquake bigger than a 6-point magnitude is a multiple event,'' he said.
``It's almost impossible to break a chunk of rock that long in one instance.'' Another strong earthquake with a magnitude of 5.0 struck western Turkey on Sunday, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
