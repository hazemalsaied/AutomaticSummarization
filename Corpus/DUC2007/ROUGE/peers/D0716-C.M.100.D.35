SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Two aboriginal protesters of an Australian uranium mine and an African who has worked to protect a huge tropical rainforest were among the winners of the Goldman Environmental Prize.
The $125,000 annuall prizes, to be awarded today, recognize efforts of grassroots environmentalism around the world.
``The common theme as always is that one person can indeed make a difference,'' said Duane Silverstein, who oversees the awards.
``You don't need a special education, special training or a special background to help save the earth''.
