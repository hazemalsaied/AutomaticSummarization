Several U.S. and European seismologists have arrived in Turkey to study the quake.
Turks nationwide are struggling to recover from the massive, 7.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the country's industrial heartland early Tuesday.
The social and economic costs appear to be staggering.
And the area hit provides almost half the tax revenue, meaning the government will have even less income to count on.
But for many people, there is no longer any work to speak of.
International efforts to assess the damage were gathering speed, with a European Community delegation arriving today and due to visit the quake zone Thursday.
