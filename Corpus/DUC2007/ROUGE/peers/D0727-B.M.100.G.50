The deposition would come two days before he and estranged wife Marianne Gingrich are to make their first court appearance together since the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives filed for divorce in July.
Last week, Gingrich's attorneys said his "intimate relationship" with congressional aide Callista Bisek started in November 1993, about a year before the Republican takeover of the U.S. House.
Randy Evans, Gingrich's attorney, filed a motion Wednesday in Cobb County Superior Court asking that Marianne Gingrich be forced to transfer the money to a joint account within 14 days.
