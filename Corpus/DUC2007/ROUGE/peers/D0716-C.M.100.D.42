Greens Senator Bob Brown said Sunday that the World Heritage Bureau Saturday night in Kyoto, Japan, granted the Australian government until April 15 to produce evidence why the United Nations should not declare Kakadu National Park, which surrounds the Jabiluka uranium mine, endangered.
Brown said the delay would see Australia's reputation "dragged through the environmental and cultural fires from experts right around the globe".
The panel recommended that all mining activities should cease in the meantime.
Francioni rejected Hill's claim that the mission's report was full of contradictions.
The majority of the drafting group reflected the views of the report.
