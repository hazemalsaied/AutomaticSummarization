Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi offered Thursday to end her road side standoff with the military government if the government agrees to release jailed members of her political party.
Myanmar's military government has detained another 187 members of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party, bringing the total to 702 arrested since a crackdown began in May.
Burma's military rulers have become increasingly dependent on the use of forced labor and torture to maintain that power, build the country's infrastructure, and carry out its war against stubborn resistance by ethnic minorities.
