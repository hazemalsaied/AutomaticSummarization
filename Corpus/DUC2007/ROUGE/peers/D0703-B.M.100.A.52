European Union's single-currency plan will take effect in 11 of its member states on January 1, 1999, when the euro will become a currency in the financial sense, but will first be used only in cashless tradings.
Euro bank notes and coins will become legal tender on January 1, 2002 while national currencies of the euro founder countries stop circulating completely by July 1, 2002.
