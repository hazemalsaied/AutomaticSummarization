ISTANBUL, August 25 (Xinhua) -- More than a week after the August 17 killer earthquake in northwestern Turkey, people with quake-related injuries were still flooding to hospitals.
In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city which straddles Europe and Asia, alone, the number of people suffering from quake-related diseases surpassed 4,100.
Quake survivors with injured heads, broken arms and legs overflew the 120 private and 38 state hospitals in the metropolis.
Nearly half of the patients in Istanbul's hospitals are suffering from bone fractures.
