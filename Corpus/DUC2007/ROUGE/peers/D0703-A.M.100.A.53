Despite skepticism about the actual realization of a single European currency as scheduled on January 1, 1999, preparations for the design of the Euro note have already begun.
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said today that most German companies are not prepared for the shift to the single European currency, the Euro, which is due to be launched on January 1, 1999.
