"Matthew Shepard died as a result of the blunt trauma injuries he sustained to his head and face," said Patrick Allen, coroner for Colorado's Larimer County, where Shepard died.
The defense opened its case Friday.
His attorneys are trying to convince the jury McKinney is guilty of manslaughter rather than murder.
St. Clair told jurors Shepard asked to sit with him inside the Fireside Lounge.
During four days of testimony, prosecutors drew a timeline of the events.
McKinney barely glanced up.
Prosecutors called their first three witnesses: Aaron Kreifels; Charles Dolan.
The plea allowed Henderson to avoid the death penalty.
