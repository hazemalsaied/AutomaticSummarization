Sen. Edward Kennedy will endorse Al Gore for president Wednesday in a move the Gore campaign hopes will help with voters in New Hampshire, next door to Kennedy's Massachusetts, and with wavering Democrats nationwide.
McCain has gained support from independents and Democrats in his primary battles with George W. Bush, and Bradley was trying hard to keep that from happening in Washington.
Both endorsements were expected to help dampen some of Bradley's most barbed criticisms of Gore - that he's a closet conservative who pays lip service to campaign finance reform.
