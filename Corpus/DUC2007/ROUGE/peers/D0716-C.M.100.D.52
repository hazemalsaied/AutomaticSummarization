CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's conservative government defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka within the park.
DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government will have until April 15 of next year to try to stop the United Nations from declaring Kakadu National Park endangered because of the Jabiluka uranium mine.
"The mine is not in a world heritage listed area nor in a national park and it will cause neither environmental nor cultural damage," Hill said.
