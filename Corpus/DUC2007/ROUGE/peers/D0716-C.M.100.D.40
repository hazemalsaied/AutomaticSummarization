Many environmentalists have been calling on the Australian government not to approve the uranium mining project adjacent to the park, but the government rejected their environmental concerns, saying jobs and export income to be generated from the mining project is important.
Australia's conservative government defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka.
The Australian federal government rejected a UNESCO report which called for Kakadu in northwest Australia to be placed on the endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka uranium mine.
