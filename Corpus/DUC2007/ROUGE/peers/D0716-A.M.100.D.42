The following are major news.
Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of the huge Jabiluka uranium mine in the country's vast Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, after the federal government approved the mining plan for the Jabilika mine yesterday.
The owners of the Jabiluka lease oppose the mine.
The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
The company already mines uranium ore at the nearby Ranger mine.
The government has ignored the wishes of Aboriginal people in the area and environmental concerns.
