Two aboriginal protesters of an Australian uranium mine and an African who has worked to protect a huge tropical rainforest were among the winners of the Goldman Environmental Prize.
The World Heritage Committee report found the Jabiluka uranium mine threatened the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area and raised the prospect of Kakadu being placed on the committee's endangered list.
The Greens accused the Howard government's standing on Kakadu National Park by saying it had become the world's leading environmental pirate for its role in stopping the immediate listing of Kakadu as an endangered area.
