The decision culminated the Clinton administration's most ambitious antitrust effort.
Under the schedule set by Jackson in April, the Justice Department and 17 states filed a brief with the court on April 28 asking the judge to break Microsoft into two companies as the remedy for the illegal behavior found in the long antitrust trial.
The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case agreed Thursday morning to delay his final ruling for about a week, giving the Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft's proposal, filed Wednesday, to revise the government's break up plan.
