Some 26,000 survivors of the August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake.
It is a bitterness that was widely felt after the 7.4-magnitude earthquake destroyed jerry-built apartment buildings, crushing some 17,000 people as they slept.
The government has done a lot to handle the post-quake cleanup, and the number of people in tents has fallen from some 120,000 immediately after the quake to 26,000 at present.
