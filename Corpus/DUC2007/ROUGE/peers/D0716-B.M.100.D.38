An old car dressed up to look like a frill-necked lizard blocked the entrance to the Jabiluka uranium mine site inside the borders of Kakadu National Park on Friday.
A dozen protesters opposed to the uranium mine chained themselves to the car-lizard about 4 a.m., according to blockade spokeswoman Kerry Nettle.
Mine builder Energy Resources of Australia has denied the mine, will have any adverse impact on Kakadu.
A firebomb attack caused more than 100,000 Australian dollars damage Monday to a Darwin office of the company building the controversial Jabiluka uranium mine.
