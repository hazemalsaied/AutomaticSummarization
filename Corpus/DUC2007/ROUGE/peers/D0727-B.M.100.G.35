ATLANTA _ Last May, Newt Gingrich told his wife he was seeing another woman and wanted a divorce.
He didn't mention the affair had been going on for six years.
``I found out with the rest of the country,'' said Marianne Gingrich, who spoke publicly about her divorce this week.
The remarks are her most extensive since the days immediately after her husband's July divorce petition was filed.
The length of the relationship, which predated Gingrich's ascension to the speakership of the U.S. House, surprised his wife.
