Some 26,000 survivors of the earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake.
A 5.2-magnitude earthquake, followed by another one of magnitude 4.6, rocked western Turkey, but the casualties from the quake are not immediately known.
At least seven people died Monday and hundreds were injured when a severe tremor shook Turkey in the same region where more than 15,000 people were killed in a huge earthquake less than a month ago.
Criticism of rescue efforts led by the military, the most respected Turkish institution, is dissipating.
