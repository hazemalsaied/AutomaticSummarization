With fresh prodding from President Clinton, the Senate is having another go at expanding the list of hate crimes and giving federal prosecutors more leeway in bringing hate crime charges.
A judge today barred defense lawyers from using a ``gay panic'' defense in the murder trial of a man accused of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard.
The prosecution had originally asked for the death penalty for Aaron McKinney, 22, for killing Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student, but later Shepard's parents agreed to spare him from lethal injection.
