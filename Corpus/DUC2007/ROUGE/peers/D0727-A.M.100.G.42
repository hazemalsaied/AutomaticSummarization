Callista Bisek is scheduled to give a videotaped deposition in the Gingriches' divorce case.
Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randolph Evans, denied the allegation and said Marianne Gingrich has always handled the couple's money.
Judge Dorothy Robinson will hear the counterclaim.
By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches also avoid answering specific charges they've made against each other since Newt Gingrich filed for the divorce in July.
Marianne Gingrich filed court papers in August before filing for divorce.
Newt Gingrich held all the couple's personal liquid assets when they separated.
Phone calls to Gingrich's office and Mrs. Gingrich's house went unanswered late Monday.
