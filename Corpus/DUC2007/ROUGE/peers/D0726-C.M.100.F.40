Vice President Al Gore, who continues to reshuffle his struggling presidential campaign, has selected Donna Brazile to be his new campaign manager, officials said today.
Vice President Al Gore said Sunday his campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, is ``doing a great job'' and will stay on despite a government report that found questionable financial management while Coelho directed the U.S. pavilion at the 1998 world's fair in Portugal.
U.S. Vice President Al Gore Thursday named Commerce Secretary William Daley to take over his presidential campaign.
