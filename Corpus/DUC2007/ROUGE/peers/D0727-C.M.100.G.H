Newt and Marianne Gingrich settled their divorce on December 16, 1999 after a mediation session that lasted 12 hours ended a bitter divorce process covering five months.
The agreement has been kept private.
Details of the depositions filed by Marianne against her husband's political and business associates and Callista Bisek and by Newt's depositions against Marianne's sister and a friend remain undisclosed.
Bisek refused to answer Marianne's questions under oath but revealed several gifts and money spent on her by Gingrich.
Both she and Gingrich admitted to having a six-year affair and plan on marrying one another in August 2000.
