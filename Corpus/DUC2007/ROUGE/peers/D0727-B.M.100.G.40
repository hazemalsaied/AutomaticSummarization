Newt Gingrich's divorce moves to a courtroom for the first time today.
A judge ruled Thursday that a congressional aide linked romantically with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich must testify in his divorce case.
In a surprise move, Newt Gingrich has initiated his own deposition of the Washington congressional aide named in his divorce.
Gingrich wants to know whether his estranged wife put him under surveillance shortly before he became speaker of the U.S. House.
Newt Gingrich kept the pressure on his estranged wife Wednesday by asking a judge to force her to turn over money he says she's hoarding.
