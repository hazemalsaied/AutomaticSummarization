Turkey's Daily News reported on Thursday that an additional 150, 000 people live in cramped prefabricated homes that are extremely hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter.
Some victims who survived disaster complained about their grievance, saying that "the state doesn't care about us." Seismologists have warned that aftershocks and tremors may shake Turkey for months and possibly years.
A new report by country's largest business federation describes that quake as ``the biggest one of 20th century affecting a large, populated industrialized area.'' ``The increased uncertainty will negatively affect all economic activity in Turkey,'' report said.
