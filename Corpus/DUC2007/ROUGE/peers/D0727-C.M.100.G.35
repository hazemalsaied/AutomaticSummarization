ATLANTA (AP) -- Newt Gingrich and the former aide with whom he acknowledged an ''intimate relationship'' while married are getting hitched this summer, his lawyer said Wednesday.
Gingrich will marry Callista Bisek on Aug. 18 in Alexandria, Va., said Randy Evans, the former House speaker's personal lawyer.
They're looking for a house in Virginia.
It'll be the former House speaker's third walk down the aisle and Bisek's first, Evans said.
Attorneys for Gingrich, 56, have acknowledged he had a relationship with Bisek, 33, while he was married to his second wife, Marianne.
They were divorced in December.
