After today's session, the mediator will report to the court whether the Gingriches have hit an impasse, reached a settlement or made progress toward a divorce agreement.
With the agreement, Newt and Marianne Gingrich end a tense legal standoff and avoid a potentially embarrassing public divorce trial.
House speaker's divorce case gave way to a secret settlement between Gingrich and his wife of 18 years, Marianne Gingrich.
A court-appointed mediator who spent 12 hours negotiating a settlement agreement between the Gingriches filed her report Friday, saying the couple came to a "full settlement" early that morning.
