Some 26,000 survivors of the 08/17/1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake.
This is a temporary measure, until the government organizes a program for rebuilding the 10,000 buildings that collapsed or that were seriously damaged in the 45-second earthquake that hit Turkey's most industrialized region.
At least seven people died and hundreds were injured when a severe tremor shook Turkey in the same region where more than 15,000 people were killed in a huge earthquake less than a month ago.
