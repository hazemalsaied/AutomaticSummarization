There's violence on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show''.
Jerry Springer knows how to fight.
It makes sense that the latest film in her ``Oprah Winfrey Presents'' series is ``David and Lisa,'' a remake of the 1962 film about two emotionally disturbed teen-agers who meet at an institution and form a tentative, healing friendship.
Former Bill Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers was the guest on still another incredible ``Roseanne Show'' installment.
Talk-show host Jon Stewart came along, Roseanne's publicists said, ``to live out his teenage fantasy of wearing a smoking jacket, drinking martinis from a crystal glass and, of course, Bunnies, Bunnies, Bunnies''!
