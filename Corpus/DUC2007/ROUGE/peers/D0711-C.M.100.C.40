A U.S. federal judge ordered Wednesday Microsoft Corp. to be split in two separate companies to correct antitrust violations.
The government says that splitting Microsoft would prevent the Windows system, that runs on over 80 percent of personal computers, from being used to force companies and consumers to use other Microsoft products.
The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case agreed Thursday morning to delay his final ruling for about a week, giving the Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft's proposal, filed Wednesday, to revise the government's break up plan.
