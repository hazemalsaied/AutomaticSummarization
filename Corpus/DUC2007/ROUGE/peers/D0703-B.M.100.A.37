BANGKOK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is considering using European single currency, euro, in country's foreign reserves, Nation reported Tuesday.
A special task force will study impact of euro on country's official reserves in a bid to help stem volatility of U.S. dollar and Japanese yen.
However, arrival of euro is likely to reduce Thailand's trading volume with other countries significantly, official said.
The total cost of introducing euro is estimated to be at 1 to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product of 11 euro countries.
