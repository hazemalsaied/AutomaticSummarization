The European Commission(EC) spokesman today formally denied newspaper reports that the EC is "secretly" drawing up plans to delay the launch of the single currency, the Euro.
France has already struck one billion coins of the European single currency euro, which will be launched by January 1999, reported Agence France-Presse(AFP) on Thursday.
In order to seize the opportunity to share in the start up of the euro, which is scheduled for January 1, 1999, the Bulgarian government adopted a system of monetary commission on July 1, 1997, and established a connection between the Bulgarian lev and the German mark.
