"I think for Brian and I, the flight really ends today, because finally, after going around the world, the Breitling Orbiter 3 has landed," said Piccard.
Asked about the state of their balloon, Jones _ who, like Piccard, wore a blue flight suit and was sipping soda from a wine glass _ said: "It's completely deflated, like me, really." Speaking to his ground crew in Switzerland, Piccard acknowledged that much of the achievement was due to forces far beyond the pilots' control.
Unlike Piccard and Jones, though, Uliassi is flying in an unpressurized crew compartment.
