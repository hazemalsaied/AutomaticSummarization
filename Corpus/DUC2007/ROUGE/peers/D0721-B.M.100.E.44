Henderson pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping and was sentenced to life in prison.
Gay college student Matthew Shepard was pummeled to death by Aaron McKinney in a drunken, drug-induced rage after Shepard made a pass at him, McKinney's attorney said Monday as his trial began.
Tangeman told the jury, McKinney ``becomes very, very upset and beats Matthew Shepard,'' prompted by memories of a sexual encounter forced upon him by an older boy when he was 7.
Shepard later met McKinney and Russell Henderson at the bar.
Michael St. Clair was the first defense witness called in the murder
