Vice President Al Gore appealed to black members of Congress and their guests February 10, 1999 night to help turn out voters next year to keep a Democrat in the White House and return control of the House to Democrats.

Gore has been criticized within the party mostly by women's groups for lacking more women in his inner circle of advisers
