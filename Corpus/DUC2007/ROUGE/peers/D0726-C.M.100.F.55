Sen. Eard Kennedy will endorse Al Gore for president Wednesday in a move the Gore campaign hopes will help with voters in New Hampshire, next door to Kennedy's Massachusetts, and with wavering Democrats nationwide.
The two issues are paramount to Kennedy and have been mainstays of Gore's campaign for the party's 2000 presidential nomination.
U.S. Vice President Al Gore Thursday named Commerce Secretary William Daley to take over his presidential campaign.
Coelho, a prominent Democratic strategist, was named general chairman of Gore's presidential campaign in May 1999 in the first major shakeup of Gore's presidential campaign.
