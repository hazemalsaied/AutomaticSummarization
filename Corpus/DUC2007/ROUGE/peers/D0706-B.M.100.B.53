The legislation, passed in 1996 by the U.S. state of Massachusetts, forbids state agencies from contracting with companies or individuals doing business with the military government of Burma, also known as Myanmar.
Many of Burma's soldiers are teenagers, often abducted by the army.
In contrast to Burma, many Chinese reformers welcome Western political and commercial engagement with their government as a spur to further openness and change.
