Turner Broadcasting System is teaming up with two major magazine publishers to launch a cable television channel aimed at women, going up against the already successful Lifetime channel.
The new venture would face competition from the successful Lifetime channel, which is run by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp., as well as a new channel called Oxygen, being developed by talk show host Oprah Winfrey and Geraldine Laybourne, one of the driving forces behind the success of Nickelodeon.
Mitchell said she thought there was plenty of room for programming aimed at women.
