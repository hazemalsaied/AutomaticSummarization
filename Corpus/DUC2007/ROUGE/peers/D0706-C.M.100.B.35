When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives in Thailand for this week's ministerial meeting of ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations, she will demonstrate American support for a regional grouping that can boast of many successes and one flagrant failure _ the military dictatorship ruining Burma.

No country in ASEAN suffers more directly from the junta's crimes than host Thailand.
For much of the past decade, the Thais have been democratizing a polity long dominated by corrupt military officers.
