Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said immediately after ruling that, as expected, company would appeal.
The government says that splitting Microsoft would prevent Windows system, that runs on over 80 percent of personal computers, from being used to force companies and consumers to use other Microsoft products.

Several of legal experts said Thursday that they saw little support for Microsoft's suggestion that judge was relying on antitrust concepts that are out of step with fast-moving computer business.
