Some 26,000 survivors of the August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake.
Izmit, also called Kocaeli province, was the epicenter of the 7.4-magnitude killer quake that hit western Turkey on August 17, killing over 14,000 people and injuring over 27,000 others.
The Bogazici Kandilli Observatory reported that the quake hit Izmit, about 110 kilometers west of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, at 11:11 local time (0811 GMT), driving people into a panic, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
