BONN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Private investors are set to benefit from the 1999 introduction of the single European currency, the euro, thanks to expanded investment opportunities, reduced currency risks, and rising competitions, the German central bank Bundesbank said Monday.
In its latest monthly report issued Monday, the Bundesbank said that as national currency boundaries vanish and most European stocks and bonds are denominated in euros, investors will be able to make use of a variety of cross-border investment opportunities in the euro area which will become the second largest capital market in the world.
