CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia faces international embarrassment over the Jabiluka uranium mine, with a U.N. committee Wednesday demanding the mine be scrapped to prevent it endangering the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area.
In a major embarrassment to the Howard government, the Bureau of the U.N.
World Heritage Committee found Kakadu was under threat, raising the prospect that the committee will this week make Kakadu only the 26th of the world's 552 World Heritage Sites to be placed on its endangered list.
