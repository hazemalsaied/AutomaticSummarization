Hill said UNESCO's report, made after only a four-day visit to the mine site, ignored the enormous body of evidence gathered over 18 years of mining at Ranger just 12 miles (20 km) from Jabiluka.

Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers) of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered.
