Justice Department lawyers savored a resounding victory Friday evening in their case against Microsoft, a victory that one official attributed not to any brilliant strategy but to the simple truth.
In its closing argument in the Microsoft trial, the government said Tuesday that it is ``simply impossible to imagine'' that the company will not be found to have violated the nation's antitrust laws, based on the mountains of courtroom evidence.
After reviewing a last-ditch settlement proposal offered by Microsoft Friday night, lawyers for the government concluded that it was inadequate to settle the landmark antitrust case against the software giant.
