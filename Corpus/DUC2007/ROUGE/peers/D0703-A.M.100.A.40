Private investors are set to benefit from the 1999 introduction of the single European currency, the euro, thanks to expanded investment opportunities, reduced currency risks, and rising competitions, the German central bank Bundesbank said Monday.
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said today that most German companies are not prepared for the shift to the single European currency, the Euro, which is due to be launched on January 1, 1999.
Despite skepticism about the actual realization of a single European currency as scheduled on January 1, 1999, preparations for the design of the Euro note have already begun.
