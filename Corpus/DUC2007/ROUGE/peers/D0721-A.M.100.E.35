LARAMIE, Wyo.
(AP) -- A judge has issued a gag order for lawyers involved in the Matthew Shepard murder trial, saying they ``gravely injured'' the defendant's right to a fair trial.
``There exists a very real danger that counsel's playing to the media has already gravely injured, or at least made much more difficult, the prospect of seating a jury in this case,'' Judge Barton R. Voigt wrote Thursday.
Voigt's ruling stemmed from a dispute between lawyers representing Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson.
