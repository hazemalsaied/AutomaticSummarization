On the tenth anniversary of the military takeover in Myanmar, about 60 exiled dissidents protested in front of their country's embassy in Bangkok on Friday calling for the release of political prisoners and arrested students.
A World Trade Organization panel is to rule in a dispute between the United States, Europe and Japan over U.S. legislation that bans trade with the military government of Burma.
The legislation, passed in 1996 by the U.S. state of Massachusetts, forbids state agencies from contracting with companies or individuals doing business with the military government of Burma, also known as Myanmar.
