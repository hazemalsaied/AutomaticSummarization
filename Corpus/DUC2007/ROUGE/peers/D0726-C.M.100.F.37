Delay will resign from present office on July 15 to replace Tony Coelho, former California congressman who was hired by Gore a year ago to lead campaign.
He called Gore Wednesday night with his resignation.
Until Wednesday, Gore's campaign had been run from high-rent offices on K Street in Washington, corridor favored by lobbying and law firms that wield so much influence in nation's capital.
Critics have suggested that campaign move is little more than a stunt by a presidential candidate who, as vice president, senator, congressman and son of a senator, has spent virtually his entire life in Washington.
