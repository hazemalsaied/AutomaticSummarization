On Thursday, accusations of wrongdoing and mining of dirt in former U.S. House speaker's divorce case gave way to a secret settlement between Gingrich and his wife of 18 years, Marianne Gingrich.
A sedate Marianne Gingrich, who did attend hearing, had only this to say about often bitter eight-month-long divorce process: ``It's been a difficult period of time.'' Marianne Gingrich plans to continue her work with Red Cross and various charity groups.
Chuck Clay, chairman of Georgia Republican Party, said divorce settlement will likely make it easier for Gingrich to return to public eye in a political setting.
