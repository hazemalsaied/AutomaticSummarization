Police said the fight helped them connect McKinney to Shepard's beating.
During the first full day of testimony, jurors also heard from the coroner who examined Shepard's body, a bartender and Morales, who said the beating rendered him unable to identify his attacker.
McKinney's co-defendant, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to kidnapping and felony murder in April and received life in prison.
