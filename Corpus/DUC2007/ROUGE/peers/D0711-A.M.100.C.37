LOS ANGELES, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Business seemed as usual at Microsoft headquarters on first day of U.S. government's antitrust trial against this software giant.
On Monday in Washington D.C., federal government and 20 states kicked off trial that accused Microsoft of illegal activities, including bullying competitors.
He asserted that Microsoft repeatedly offered IBM better terms and prices for Windows if it favored Microsoft products ranging from so-called office productivity applications to its Internet browsing software.
Much of detailed, company-by-company information on prices to makers for Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system was submitted in previous testimony.
