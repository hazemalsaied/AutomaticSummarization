GENEVA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic Committee said Wednesday that they will award Olympic Order to balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones who are first to circumnavigate world in a balloon.
Piccard of Switzerland and Briton Jones joined first man on moon, American astronaut Neil Armstrong, and other aeronautical legends such as Charles Lindbergh as recipients of higly-valued award.
Unlike Piccard and Jones, though, Uliassi is flying in an unpressurized crew compartment.
The Egyptian government spokesman, Nabil Osman, said that weather-driven changes in plans for balloon's landing had slowed military's plans for swift recovery of crew.
