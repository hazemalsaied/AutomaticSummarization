BONN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Private investors are set to benefit from 1999 introduction of single European currency, euro, thanks to expanded investment opportunities, reduced currency risks, and rising competitions, German central bank Bundesbank said Monday.
Moreover, investors are also set to benefit from reduced transaction costs and improved market transparency resulting from heated competitions among financial institutions after advent of euro, Bundesbank said.
The European Union member states are required to completely replace their own national currencies with Euro from January 1, 2002.
