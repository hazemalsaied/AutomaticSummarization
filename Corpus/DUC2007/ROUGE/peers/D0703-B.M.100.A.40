European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Thursday that Europe's new single currency, the euro, won't compete with the U.S. dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves.
The report also said Duisenberg expects the future relationship between the dollar and the euro, which officially goes into effect on Jan. 12, to be stable.
The founder countries of the euro, as the new single currency is known, are scheduled to adopt new currency while banks and exchanges will start using euro in all scriptural transactions such as writing checks, using credit and charge cards, and buying bonds and stocks.
