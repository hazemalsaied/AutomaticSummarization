In 1997, the Australian government approved the development of the Jabiluka uranium mine.
The mine is in Kakadu National Park, which is on the UNESCO World Heritage list of important cultural and environmental sites.
The government's decision was condemned by environmentalists, who were concerned with the potential for consigning tons of radioactive waste in an environmentally sensitive area, and by opposition parties, who claimed the government ignored the wishes of Aboriginal people in the area.
The government defended their decision saying the mine would generate millions of revenue dollars and create 2,000 jobs.
Protestors were arrested at the mine site.
