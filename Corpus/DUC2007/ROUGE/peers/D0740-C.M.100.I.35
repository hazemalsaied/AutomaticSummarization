An Arizona man trying to become the first solo balloonist to complete a nonstop trip around the world was speeding over India Thursday, hoping to steer clear of the Himalayas.
The pilot, Kevin Uliassi, was nearly halfway through his journey, which began in Rockford, Ill., on Feb. 22.
After some slow going in the early days of the flight, Uliassi's balloon, the J. Renee, found better winds and at midweek was traveling at about 100 miles an hour, said Scott Lorenz, a spokesman.
