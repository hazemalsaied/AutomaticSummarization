Reacting to a new Federal Trade Commission report criticizing Hollywood for targeting children with violent products, Gore said they would ask the entertainment industry for a voluntary "cease- fire" in marketing inappropriate movies, video games and music to children.
Gore said that if elected, his administration would give entertainment companies six months to clean up their act or face unspecified "tougher measures" under current laws on advertising.
He said that if the entertainment industry does not change its practice in the six months, it could be found guilty of false advertising.
