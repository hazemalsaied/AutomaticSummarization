With the agreement, Newt and Marianne Gingrich end a tense legal standoff and avoid a potentially embarrassing public divorce trial.
On Thursday, accusations of wrongdoing and the mining of dirt in the former U.S. House speaker's divorce case gave way to a secret settlement between Gingrich and his wife of 18 years, Marianne Gingrich.
Newt Gingrich, 56, who has admitted to having a six-year affair with a House congressional aide, filed for divorce July 29.
In his July divorce petition, Newt Gingrich said the marriage was "irretrievably broken," a standard clause under Georgia's "no fault" divorce laws.
