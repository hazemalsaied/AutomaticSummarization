WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department's landmark antitrust trial and earlier legal actions against the Microsoft Corp. have cost $13.3 million over the past decade, the department said Wednesday in its first public accounting.
The figure includes about $7 million investigating and suing Microsoft in the trial pending before U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, described as among the most significant business lawsuits in decades.
The first phase of a two-part verdict could come this month.
Experts described the $7 million as paltry compared with the expense of other major antitrust cases, where costs easily can run $750,000 each month.
