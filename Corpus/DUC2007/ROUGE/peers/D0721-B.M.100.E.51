The defense portrayed McKinney as the victim of sexual abuse who lashed out when approached for a gay encounter.
McKinney's judgment that night was affected by alcohol, methamphetamines and ``some sexually traumatic and confusing events in his life,'' defense attorney Jason Tangeman told jurors.
The plea allowed Henderson to avoid the death penalty.
McKinney has been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery.
Henderson pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping and was sentenced to life in prison.
