Vice President Al Gore, accepting endorsements from hundreds of Latino leaders, warned Tuesday that Republican-sponsored tax cuts, the GOP's opposition to census sampling and Texas Gov. George Bush's education proposals could wipe out economic gains made by Hispanics under administration policies.
The Hispanic endorsements of Gore may have taken some of the sting out of the decision by Friends of the Earth, an influential environmental group, to back former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's sole competitor for the 2000 Democratic presidential campaign.
