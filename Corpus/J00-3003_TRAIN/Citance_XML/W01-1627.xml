	<SECTION title="Motivation" number = "1">
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Dialogue analysis systems have been developed in oncology as a tool for assessing and improv­ing the communication skills of health profession­als.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Rates of psychiatric morbidity (clinical anxi­ety and depression) in cancer patients are lowered when health professionals have adequate commu­nication skills to discover and address the patients’ concerns and worries.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Health professionals inter­viewing patients sometimes exhibit negative be­haviours, such as “blocking” a certain line of in­vestigation rather than encouraging the patient to describe his or her problem.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">On the other hand, a skilled interviewer uses active interven­tions to direct the progress of the interview, as well as more passive responses.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Several oncology research groups have demonstrated that these pat­terns can be detected and quanti.ed through anal­ysis of conversations between health professionals and patients.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">This in turn can form a basis for more e.ective training in communication skills.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">The Psychological Medicine Group at Manch­ester (PMG), funded by the Cancer Research Campaign (CRC), is a leading group in dialogue analysis in oncology.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">This paper describes the parameters and tagsets (analogous to “Dialogue Act” tagging (Stolcke et al 2000)), which they and three other groups have developed for this highly specialised domain.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">This domain o.ers an interesting contrast to the “instructional” or “service” dialogues commonly studied.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">The health professional is the “expert” in the conventional sense, and at times conveys med­ical information to the less knowledgeable patient in a conventional way.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">At other times, the patient should be seen as the “expert” with regard to his or her own perceived physical and mental condi­tion, and the task of the health professional is ef­fectively that of “knowledge elicitation” as under­stood in expert systems development.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">This .exi­ble and dynamic shifting of participants’ roles in a dialogue poses an interesting challenge, compared to the clearly de.ned and static roles assumed in much work in dialogue analysis.</S>
	</SECTION>
	<SECTION title="Parameters for dialogue tagging. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "1">Complete and accurate tagging of dialogue must encode a number of independent aspects of each utterance.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "2">These are represented as “layers” in the DAMSL system (Core &amp; Allen 1997).</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "3">Form-based tags (question, statement) are sup­plemented with diacritics indicating other types of information, such as task-management or communication-management.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "4">The four oncology dialogue tagging systems considered here all share this basic principle, al­though they di.er in the speci.cs.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "5">Butow et al (1995:1115) cite the recognition as early as 1983 of “layers of meaning ... such as the con­tent, the process, the emotion and the purpose”.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "6">Their own CNLOGIT system encodes three “di­mensions”: “source” (who is speaking), “process” (questions, responses, initiated statements), and “content”.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "7">A complete dialogue can be mapped into a three-dimensional information space, and measures can be applied such as how much time was spent in each cell of the cube.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "8">Ong et al (1998) use the Roter Interaction Analysis Sys­tem (RIAS).</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "9">Each utterance in a dialogue is cat­egorised, and also rated on .ve distinct “global a.ect” scales.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "10">The Medical Interaction Process System (MIPS) of Ford et al (2000) also stresses the multidimensional nature of dialogue annota­tion, using .fteen “content codes” and eight “af­fective modes”.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "11">PMG (Maguire &amp; Faulkner 1988; Maguire p.c.) have separate tagsets for Form, Function, Content, Level, Cue, Cue Management, Blocking, and Focus.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "12">One can see an implicit consensus here that (to use NLP terms) syntactic form, overt semantic content, pragmatic force, and cognitive a.ect are distinct and are all signi.cant.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "13">The di.ering de­grees of detail and prominence they receive in the di.erent systems are discussed under those head­ings in the next section.</S>
	</SECTION>
	<SECTION title="Dialogue tagsets. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "1">Not surprisingly, the actual tagsets developed in oncology re.ect their domain more closely than the parameter sets do.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "2">In comparison with NLP work, syntactic classi.cation is minimal and func­tionally oriented, while communication manage­ment and psychological / emotional loading re­ceive prominent, .negrained analysis.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "3">3.1 Form.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "4">Although all four oncology systems encode the form of an utterance in some way, the classi.ca­tions have a strong pragmatic bias.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "5">Questions are distinguished, not in traditional syntactic terms as yes-no or wh-, but according to their e.ect on the .ow of the dialogue.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "6">The simplest set is that of Butow et al: Open Question, Closed Question, Response to Question, Statement, Other.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "7">PMG add Directive Question (open), Directive Question (closed), Screening Question, Leading Question, Multiple Question.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "8">Ford et al distinguish “modes” from “con­tent codes”, but even the modes encode coarse-grained content information as well as a.ective classi.cation.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "9">The form categories of Ong et al are “instrumental” (Directions, Question-asking, Information-giving, &amp;c), and they specify that “if a decision must be made between categorizing an utterance in an instrumental or a.ect category, the a.ect category should be used” -quite rea­sonably, given the purpose of their analysis.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "10">Even with a prior commitment to maintaining separate and independent levels of analysis, some leakage between levels can occur.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "11">(The set of forty-two Dialogue Act labels used by Stolcke et al (2000) shows some similar mixing of levels, includ­ing both purely syntactic tags (such as Declarative Yes-No Question) and a.ective tags (such as Ap­preciation).)</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "12">3.2 Content.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "13">The content of an utterance is also encoded in all four systems, and the tagsets on this level are the most domain-speci.c. Butow et al cite seven con­tent categories: Treatment, Diagnosis, Prognosis, History, Other medical matters, Social matters.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "14">Ford et al, with 15 content codes, and PMG, with 38, are the most fully developed.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "15">Both include Medical (further distinguished by PMG, with four categories for diagnosis and two for prog­nosis), Treatment, Psychological, Social, Lifestyle, &amp;c. PMG are particularly detailed in their cat­egories for psychological and emotional issues, shading into the a.ect level: Concerns, Feelings, Emotions, Religion, &amp;c. Again, this is what one would expect, given that their reason for carry­ing out the analysis is to assess the health pro­fessional’s success in getting the patient to talk about exactly these issues.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "16">Both Ford and PMG also include the opening and closing of the interview under this heading, where it sits oddly.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "17">A separate level of commu­nication management, as in DAMSL, would ac­commodate these and the open/ closed/ directive question distinction currently made in the Form tagsets, clarifying all three.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "18">3.3 Pragmatics.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "19">As noted above, the Form classes used in the four coding schemes express more pragmatic than syn­tactic information.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "20">Ong et al’s “instrumental clus­ters and categories” (Directions, Question-ask­ing, Information-giving, Counselling) can be con­sidered pragmatic.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "21">So can PMG’s “Function” codes: eliciting, checking, acknowledgement (psy­chological, general, cognitions); reassurance, ne­gotiation, information giving.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "22">These are similar to some of the Dialogue Act labels used in NLP work: Stolcke et al’s (2000) agreement, response acknowledgement, summarize, or VERBMOBIL’s suggest, con.rm, clarify (Jekat et al 1995).</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "23">3.4 A.ect Cognitive a.ect -the psychological force, for a patient, of an utterance or a complete dialogue ­is the focus of interest in oncology and thus the most highly developed area.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "24">Ford et al pick out eight of their “modes” as a.ective, including the expression of irritation, gratitude, apology, and concern.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "25">Ong et al rate both doctor and patient, by cod­ing their utterances, on .ve distinct “global a.ect” scales: Anger/ irritation, Anxiety/ nervousness, Dominance/ assertiveness, Interest/ engagement, Friendliness/ warmth.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "26">Their “a.ective clusters and categories” comprise (with subheadings) so­cial behaviour, verbal attentiveness, showing con­cern, and negative talk.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "27">PMG do not represent a.ect as a separate pa­rameter, as such.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "28">Their function codes include a.ective functions such as Empathy and Reassur­ance.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "29">Many of their content codes can also repre­sent a.ect, as noted above.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "30">Topics such as Con­cerns, Feelings about health care, Religion / spiri­tual issues can be addressed at any level from sim­ply factual to deeply emotional, blurring the pic­ture: this would be clari.ed if the a.ect level were explicitly factored out.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "31">The most direct represen­tation of a.ective level comes in the two codes Psychological explicit and Psychological implicit.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "32">Each utterance in a dialogue can be given several content codes, commonly including one of these two, as seen in the sample dialogue below.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "33">Cognitive a.ect has barely been touched on by NLP research in dialogue tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "34">It is clearly more subtle and di.cult than syntactic, seman­tic, or pragmatic analysis, and also less signi.cant in instructional or service dialogues than in the highly charged, life-critical domain of cancer care.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "35">It is, however, an important aspect of dialogue and speaker modelling, and of the design of appropri­ate responses.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "36">In this area, NLP could learn some valuable lessons from oncology.</S>

	<SECTION title="An example. " number = "4">
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "1">Here is a brief typical example from a PMG anno­tated dialogue.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "2">Notice the multiple and somewhat diverse content codes, and the classi.cation of cue management (somewhat counter-intuitively attached to the cue utterance itself, not the response).</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "3">P26: I said there’s only another thing that I hope I never have to have and that’s selectron treatment.</S>

	<SECTION title="Implementations. " number = "5">
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "1">All the dialogue tagging work in oncology has been done manually.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "2">A few primitive software tools have been developed to support the tagging pro­cess and to analyse the results.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "3">Ong et al (1998) have developed a Turbo Pas­cal “computerized version” of the RIAS coding system.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "4">The advantages they claim for it give one some idea of average state of its .eld: “With this program, classi.cation of utterances can be done directly on computer.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "5">As a result, the extra step of entering paper and pencil data into the computer is omitted.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "6">Also, sequential in­formation is kept.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "7">Moreover, because the ten last classi.cations are constantly visible on the screen there is direct feedback about the ongoing conver­sation.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "8">This provides an important memory aid with respect to which utterance has to be coded next.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "9">As a consequence, the task becomes less at­tention demanding and therefore less error-prone.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "10">By giving the opportunity to save the content of the last coded utterance, an additional memory aid is provided for shorter and longer breaks.” (Ong et al 1998:400) Butow’s group have developed a “computer­based interaction analysis system” with three parts: “(i) micro level analysis coded in real time and retaining the sequence of events, (ii) event counts and (iii) macro level analysis of consulta­tion style and a.ect” (Butow et al 1995:1116).</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "11">“At the micro level the aim is to break the consul­tation down into its components and to charac­terise, count and/or time them...</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "12">At the macro level, the aim is to characterise the consulta­tion in a more holistic way, such as patient­centred vs doctor-centred, authoritarian vs a.l­iative or friendly vs hostile.” (ibid:1115) All three forms of analysis depend on counting and timing utterance-events classi.ed according to the three-dimensional model described above, although Bu-tow et al stress that they also “retain the sequence of events”.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "13">“In future analyses we will explore se­quential information e.ects” (ibid:1120).</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "14">This is evidently a signi.cant innovation in its .eld.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "15">The fundamental concept of a grammar of dialogue is simply missing from the oncology work.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "16">On the other hand, their techniques for “macro-level” analysis of dialogues may well have something to o.er, especially in the subtle areas of modelling and adapting to speakers’ attitudes and underly­ing intentions.</S>

	<SECTION title="Prospects. " number = "6">
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "1">All this work has been developed with care, in the light of experience, to serve a speci.c and unusual purpose.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "2">However, it shows no awareness of dia­logue tagging work in NLP.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "3">Both .elds can bene.t from collaboration.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "4">The author, together with Prof. Peter Maguire of PMG, has recently been granted support by CRC to develop practical software support for the PMG oncology dialogue annotators.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "5">This paper presents a preliminary analysis, part of a feasibility study for that project.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "6">An associated PhD studentship, awarded by the University of Manchester Department of Computer Science, ensures that the NLP perspective will be rep­resented and the theoretical issues addressed.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "7">We look forward to presenting more detailed analyses, and original proposals, in the future.</S>
