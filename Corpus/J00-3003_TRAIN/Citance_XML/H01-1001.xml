			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Information access to oral communication is becoming an interesting research area since recording, storing and trans­mitting large amounts of audio (and video) data is feasible today.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">While written information is often available elec­tronically (especially since it is typically entered on com­puters) oral communication is usually only documented by constructing a new document in written form such as a tran­script (court proceedings) or minutes (meetings).</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Oral com­munications are therefore a large untapped resource, espe­cially if no corresponding written documents are available and the cost of documentation using traditional techniques is considered high: Tutorial introductions by a senior sta.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">member might be worthwhile to attend by many newcomers, o.ce meetings may contain informations relevant for oth­ers and should be reproducable, informal and formal group meetings may be interesting but not fully documented.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">In essence the written form is already a reinterpretation of the original rejoinder.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Such a reinterpretation are used to • extract and condense information • add or delete information • change the meaning • cite the rejoinder • relate rejoinders to each other Reinterpretation is a time consuming, expensive and op­tional step and written documentation is combining reinter­pretation and documentation step in one 1 . If however rein­terpretation is not necessary or unwanted a system which is producing audiovisual records is superior.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">If reinterpreta­tion is wanted or needed a system using audiovisual records may be used to improve the reinterpretation by adding all audiovisual data and the option to go back to the unaltered original.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Whether reinterpretation is done or not it is cru­cial to be able to navigate e.ectively within an audiovisual document and to .nd a speci.c document..</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">1The most important exception is the literal courtroom transcript, however one could argue that even transcripts are reinterpretations since they do not contain a number of informations present in the audio channel such as emotions, hesitations, the use of slang and certain types of hetereglos­sia, accents and so forth.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">This is speci.cally true if tran­scription machines are used which restrict the transcriber to standard orthography.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">Figure 1: Information access hierarchy: Oral com­munications take place in very di.erent formats and the .rst step in the search is to determine the database (or sub-database) of the rejoinder.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">The next step is to .nd the speci.c rejoinder.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Since re­joinders can be very long the rejoinder has to seg­mented and a segment has to be selected.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">While keywords are commonly used in information ac­cess to written information the use of other indices such as style is still uncommon (but see Kessler et al.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">(1997); van Bretan et al.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">(1998)).</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Oral communication is richer than written communication since it is an interactive real time accomplishment between participants, may involve speech gestures such as the display of emotion and is situated in space and time.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">Bahktin (1986) characterizes a conversa­tion by topic, situation and style.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">Information access to oral communication can therefore make use of indices that pertain to the oral nature of the discourse (Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">2).</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">Indices other than topic (represented by keywords) increase in importance since browsing audio documents is cumber­some which makes the common interactive retrieval strategy “query, browse, reformulate” less e.ective.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">Finally the topic may not be known at all or may not be that relevant for the query formulation, for example if one just wants to be re­minded what was being discussed last time a person was met.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">Activities are suggested as an alternative index and are a description of the type of interaction.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">It is common to use “action-verbs” such as story-telling, discussing, plan­ning, informing, etc. to describe activities 2 . Items similar to activities have been shown to be directly retrievable from autobiographic memory (Herrmann, 1993) and are therefore indices that are available to participants of the conversation.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">Other indices may be very e.ective but not available: The frequency of the word “I” in the conversation, the histogram of word lengths or the histogram of pitch per participant..</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">In Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">1 the information access hierarchy is being intro­duced which allows to understand the problem of informa­tion access to oral communication at di.erent levels.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "40">In Ries (1999) we have shown that the detection of general di­ 2 The de.nition of activities such as planning may vary vastly across general dialogue genres, for example compare a military combat situation with a mother child interaction.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "41">However it is often possible to develop activities and dia­logue typologies for a speci.c dialogue genre.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "42">The related problem of general typologies of dialogues is still far from being settled and action-verbs are just one potential catego­rization (Fritz.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "43">and Hundschnur, 1994).</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "44">Figure 2: Bahktin’s characterization of dialogue: Bahktin (1986) describes a discourse along the three major properties style, situation and topic.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "45">Current information retrieval systems focus on the topical as­pect which might be crucial in written documents.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "46">Furthermore, since throughout text analysis is still a hard problem, information retrieval has mostly used keywords to characterize topic.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "47">Many features that could be extracted are therefore ignored in a tradi­tional keyword based approach.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "48">alogue genre (database level in Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "49">1) can be done with high accuracy if a number of di.erent example types have been annotated; in Ries et al.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "50">(2000) we have shown that it is hard but not impossible to distinguish activities in per­sonal phone calls (segment level in Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "51">1) . In this paper we will address activities in meetings and other types of di­alogues and show that these activities can be distinguished using certain features and a neural network based classi.er (Sec.</S>

			<S sid ="54" ssid = "54">The concept of information retrieval assessment using information theoretic measures is applied to this task (Sec.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "55">3).</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "56">Additionally we will introduce a level somewhat below the database level in Fig.</S>

			<S sid ="58" ssid = "58">4).</S>

			<S sid ="61" ssid = "1">We are interested in the detection of activities that are described by action verbs and have annotated those in two databases: meetings have been collected at Interactive Systems Labs at CMU (Waibel et al., 1998) and a subset of 8 meetings has been annotated.</S>

			<S sid ="88" ssid = "7">Hidden units have not been used since they did not yield improvements on this task.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "8">The network was trained using RPROP with momentum (Ried­ miller and Braun, 1993) and corresponds to an exponen­tial model (Nigam et al., 1999).</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "9">The momentum term can be interpreted as a Gaussian prior with zero mean on the network weights.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "10">It is the same architecture that we used previously (Ries et al., 2000) for the detection of activities on CallHome Spanish.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "11">Although some feature sets could be trained using the iterative scaling algorithm if no hidden units are being used the training times weren’t high enough to justify the use of the less .exible iterative scaling algo­rithm.</S>

			<S sid ="97" ssid = "16">The tagger uses the code by Brill (1994).</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "17">5 The model was trained to be very portable and therefore the following choices were taken: (a) the dialogue model is context-independent and (b) only the part of speech are taken as the input to the model plus the 50 most likely word/part of speech types.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "18">dominance is described as the distribution of the speaker dominance in a conversation.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "19">The distribution is rep­resented as a histogram and speaker dominance is mea­sured as the average dominance of the dialogue acts (Linell et al., 1988) of each speaker.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "20">The dialogue acts are de­tected and the dominance is a numeric value assigned for each dialogue act type.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "21">Dialogue act types that restrict the options of the conversation partners have high dominance (questions), dialogue acts that signal understanding (backchannels) carry low dominance.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "22">First author The activities used for classi.cation are those of the semi-naive coder.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "23">The “.rst author” column de­scribes the “accuracy” of the .rst author with respect to the naive coder.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "24">The detection of interactive activities works fairly well using the dominance feature on SBC which is also natu­ral since the relative dominance of speakers should describe what kind of interaction is exhibited.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "25">The dialogue act dis­tribution on the other hand works fairly well on the more homogeneous meeting database were there is a better chance to see generalizations from more speci.c dialogue based in­formation.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "26">Overall the combination of more than one feature is really important since word level, Wordnet and stylistic information, while sometimes successful, seem to be able to improve the result while they don’t provide good features by themselves.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "27">The meeting data is also more di.cult which might be due to its informal style.</S>

			<S sid ="110" ssid = "29">INFORMATION ACCESS ASSESSMENT.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "30">Assuming a probabilistic information retrieval model a query r – in our example an activity – predicts a docu­ q(r|d)q(d) ment d with the probability q(d|r)= .Let p(d, r) q(r) be the real probability mass distribution of these quanti­ties.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "31">The probability mass function q(r|d) is estimated on a separate training set by a neural network based classi­.er 6 . The quantity we are interested in is the reduction in expected coding length of the document using the neural network based detector 7:.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "32">q(D)1Eplog ˜ H(R) - Ep log q(D|R) q(R|D) The two expectations correspond exactly to the measures in Tab.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "33">5, the .rst represents the baseline, the second the one for the respective classi.er.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "34">In more standard information theoretic notation this quantity may be written as: H(R) - (Hp(R|D)+ D(p(r|d)||q(r|d))) This equivalence is not extremely useful though since the quantities in parenthesis can’t be estimated separately.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "35">For the small meeting database and SBC however no entropy reductions could be obtained.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "36">On the larger databases, on the other hand, entropy reductions could be obtained (˜ 0.5bit on the CallHome Spanish database Ries et al.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "37">(2000), ˜ 1bit for the sub-database detection problem in Sec.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "38">4).</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "39">6All quantities involving the neural net q(r|d) have been determined using a round robin approach such that network is trained on a separate training set.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "40">7Since estimating q(d) is simple we may assume that q(d) ˜ 7 p(d, r).</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "41">r Another option is to assume that the labels of one coder are part of D. If the query by the other coder is R we are in­terested in the reduction of the document entropy given the query.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "42">If we furthermore assume that H(R|D)= H(R|R&apos;) where R&apos; is the activity label embedded in D: H(D) - H(D|R)= H(R) - H(R|D)= MI(R, R&apos;) Tab.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "43">2 shows that the labels of the semi-naive coder and the .rst author only inform each other by 0.250.65 bits.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "44">How­ever, since all constraints are important to apply, it might be important to include manual annotations to be matched by a query or in a graphical presentation of the output results.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "45">Another interesting question to consider is whether the activity is correlated with the rejoinder or not.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "46">This ques­tion is important since a correlation of the activity with the rejoinder would mean that the indexing performance of ac­tivities needs to be compared to other indices that apply to rejoinders such as attendance, time and place (for results on the correlation with rejoinders see Waibel et al.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "47">(2001)).</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "48">The correlation can be measured using the mutual information between the activity and the meeting identity.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "49">The mutual information is moderate for SBC (˜ 0.67 bit) and much lower for the meetings (˜ 0.20 bit).</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "50">This also corresponds to our intuition since some of the rejoinders in SBC belong to very distinct dialogue genre while the meeting database is homogeneous.</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "51">The conclusion is that activities are useful for navigation in a rejoinder if the database is homogeneous and they might be useful for .nding conversations in a more heterogeneous database.</S>

			<S sid ="157" ssid = "8">The entropy reduction by automatically detected emotional activities is ˜ 0.3bit 8 . A similar attempt can be made for dominance (Linell et al., 1988) distributions: Dominance is easy to understand for the user of an information access system and it can be determined automatically with high accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "9">A similar classi.cation result for emotions on the utter­ance level has been obtained by just using the laughter vs. non-laughter tokens of the transcript as the input.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "10">This may indicate that (a) the index should really be the amount of laughter in the conversational segment and that (b) emo­tions might not be displayed very overtly in meetings.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "11">These results however would require a wider sampling of meeting types to be generally acceptable.</S>

			<S sid ="161" ssid = "1">It has been shown that activities can be detected and that they may be e.cient indices for access to oral communica­tion.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "2">Overall it is easy to make high level distinctions with automated methods while .negrained distinctions are even hard to make for humans – on the other hand automatic methods are still able to model some aspect of it (Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "3">3).</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "4">To obtain an reduction in entropy a relatively large database such as CallHome Spanish is required (120 dialogues).</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "5">Al­ternatives to activities might be emotional and dominance distributions that are easier to detect and that may be nat­ural to understand for users.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "6">If activities are only used for local navigation support within a rejoinder one could also visualize by displaying the dialogue act patterns for each channel on a time line.</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "7">The author has also observed that topic clusters and activ­ities are largely independent in the meeting domain result­ing in orthogonal indices.</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "8">Since activities have intuitions for naive users and they may be remembered it can be assumed that users would be able to make use of these constraints.</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "9">Ongoing work includes the use of speaker activity for dia­logue segmentation and further assessment of features for information access.</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "10">Overall the methods presented here and the ongoing work are improving the ability to index oral communication.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "11">It should be noted that some of the tech­niques presented lend themselves to implementations that don’t require (full) speech recognition: Speaker identi.ca­tion and dialogue act identi.cation may be done without an LVCSR system which would allow to lower the compu­tational requirements as well as to a more robust system.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "12">Figure 3: Detection accuracy summary: The detec­tion of high-level genre as exempli.ed by the di.er­entiation of corpora can be done with high accuracy using simple features (Ries, 1999).</S>
			<S sid ="173" ssid = "13">Similar it was fairly easy to discriminate between male and female speakers on Switchboard (Ries, 1999).</S>
			<S sid ="174" ssid = "14">Discrimi­nating between sub-genre such as TV-show types (Sec.</S>
			<S sid ="175" ssid = "15">4) can be done with reasonable accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="176" ssid = "16">How­ever it is a lot harder to discriminate between ac­tivities within one conversation for personal phone calls (CallHome) (Ries et al., 2000) or for general rejoinders (Santa) and meetings (Sec.</S>
