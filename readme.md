# Abstract 

The rapid growth of the amount of information has prompted the emergence of many IT domains including
automatic summarization (AS). These systems are used to extract the most relevant information from
huge amounts of data.

In this repository, we are working on an AS system that focuses on multiple scientific articles summarization.
These summaries could help in organizing the huge amount of scientific production and could provide
scientific digests attached to the same subject.

In our system, we experiment the features maximization (FM) in this context. this statistical method
initially designed for machine learning provides a language-agnostic and non-parametric approach of
AS. We integrate this method with traditional structures of AS systems and with a graph-based model
exploiting the spread activation algorithm.

In sum, this thesis introduce a new approach for AS based on FM and it aims to evaluate the performance
of this method in the task of producing extractive summaries, either generic summaries or query-focused
ones.
