A verb was assigned membership in an intersection class if it was listed in each of the existing classes that were combined to form the new intersection class . 
motion Figure 3 shows intersection classes involving two classes of verbs of manner of motion ( run and roll verbs ) and a class of verbs of existence ( meÂ­ under verbs ) . 
This listing of a verb in more than one class ( many verbs are in three or even four classes ) is left open to interpretation in Levin . 
In this experiment , we have tried to choose the Portuguese verb that is most closely related to the description of the English verb in the Levin class . 
What constitutes a clear sepaÂ­ ration into senses for any one verb , and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished ? 
We also examine similar classes in Portuguese , and the predictive powers of alternations in this language with respect to the same semantic components . 
WordNet does not currently provide a consistent treatment of regular sense extenÂ­ ion some are listed as separate senses , others are not mentioned at all ) .
