If M = 10 , 15 Chinese words ( i.e. , the first 19 Chinese words in Table 3 except å¶çæ¯ å·´ä½äº å©å æ®å©æ³ have their correct English translations at rank one position . 
must precede the pinyin syllable mapped to e2 . Our method differs from ( Knight and Graehl , 1998 ) and ( AlOnaizan and Knight , 2002b in that our method does not generate candidates but For the transliteration model , we use a modified only estimatesP ( e | c ) for candidates e appear model of ( Knight and Graehl , 1998 ) and ( Al ing in the English corpus . 
In this paper , we proposed a new method to mine new word translations from comparable corpora , by combining context and transliteration information , which are complementary sources of information . 
This pronunciation is converted to source language pronunciation and then to source language word that our method estimates stead of P ( c | e ) and P ( e ) . 
We evaluated our approach on six months of Chinese and English Gigaword corpora , with encouraging results . 
Being more readily available , comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations , although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora . 
So we use the the context of c , we are likely to retrieve the context of e when we use the context of c as query C ( c ) to retrieve a documents C ( e* ) that * the query and try to retrieve the most similar best matches the
