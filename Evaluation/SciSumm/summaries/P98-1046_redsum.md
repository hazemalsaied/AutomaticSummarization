The list of members for each Levin verb class is not always complete , so to check if a particular verb belongs to a class it is better to check that the verb exhibits all the alternations that deÂ­ fine the class . 
On the other hand , the scribble verbs do form an intersection class with the perforÂ­ dance verbs , since paint and write are also in both classes , in addition to draw . 
motion Figure 3 shows intersection classes involving two classes of verbs of manner of motion ( run and roll verbs ) and a class of verbs of existence ( meÂ­ under verbs ) .

This is exemplified by the Levin cut verbs and the intersection class formed by the cut verbs and split verbs . 
This listing of a verb in more than one class ( many verbs are in three or even four classes ) is left open to interpretation in Levin . 
Some verbs can be used to describe motion of both animate and inanimate objects , and thus appear in both roll and run verb classes . 
Instead , in their use as split verb , each verb manifests an extended sense that can be paraphrased as `` separate by V-ing , '' where `` V '' is the basic meaning of
