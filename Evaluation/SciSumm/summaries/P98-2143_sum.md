We have also adapted and evaluated the approach for Polish ( 93.3 % success rate ) and for Arabic ( 95.2 % success rate ) . 
We have described a robust , knowledge-poor apÂ­ roach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger . 
Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7 % for the genre of techÂ­ finical manuals and at least in this genre , the approach appears to be more successful than other similar methods . 
`` Non-prepositional '' noun phrases A `` pure '' , `` non-prepositional '' noun phrase is given a higher preference than a noun phrase which is part of a prepositional phrase ( 0 , -1 ) . 
The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3 % in resolvÂ­ ing anaphora with critical success rate of 86.2 % ) . 
The first BaseÂ­ line Model ( Baseline Subject ) was successful in only 23.7 % of the cases , whereas the second ( Baseline Most Recent ) had a success rate of 68.4 % . 
The evaluation for Polish was based technical manuals available on the Internet ( Internet Manual , 1994 ; Java Manual 1998 ) . 
If immediate reference has not been identified , then priority is given to the Candi date with the best collocation pattern score . 
Antecedent indicators ( preferences ) play a decisive role in tracking down the antecedent from a set of possible candidates . 
Similarly to the evaluation for English , we comÂ­ pared the approaches for Polish with ( i ) a baseline models which discounts candidates on the basis of agreement in number and gender and , if there were still competing candidates , selects as the antecedent the most recent subject matching the anaphora in gender and number ( ii ) a baseline models which checks agreement in number and gender and , if there were still more than one candidates left , picks up as the antecedent the most recent noun phrase that agrees with the anaphora
