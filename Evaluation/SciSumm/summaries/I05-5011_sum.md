For each domain , phrases which contain the same keyword are gathered to build a set of phrases ( Step 3 ) . 
This research was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency as part of the Translingual Information Detection , Extraction and Summarization ( TIDES ) program , under Grant N66001001-18917 from the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center , San Diego , and by the National Science Foundation under Grant IIS00325657 . 
In total 13,976 phrases are assigned to sets of phrases , and the accuracy on our evaluation data ranges from 65 to 99 % , depending on the domain and the size of the sets . 
Keyword detection error Even if a keyword consists of a single word , there are words which are not desirable as keywords for a domain . 
Extract NE instance pairs with contexts First , we extract NE pair instances with their context from the corpus . 
Link phrases based on instance pairs Using NE instance pairs as a clue , we find links between sets of phrases . 
We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus . 
If the expression is longer or complicated ( like âA buys Bâ and âAâs purchase of Bâ ) , it is called paraphrase i.e . a set of phrases which express the same thing or event .
