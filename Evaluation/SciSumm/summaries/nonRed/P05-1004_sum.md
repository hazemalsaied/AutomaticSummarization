They have kindly supplied us with the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set and one cross-validation run of the WORDNET 1.6 test set . 
This work has been supported by a Commonwealth scholarship , Sydney University Travelling Scholarship and Australian Research Council Discovery Project DP0453131 . 
We would like to thank Massi Ciaramita for supplying his original data for these experiments and answering our queries , and to Stephen Clark and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback and corrections . 
One solution would be to take the intersection between vectors across words for each superdense i.e . to find the common contexts that these words appear in ) . 
The LDC has recently released the English Gigaword corpus which includes most of the corpora listed above . 
Each extracted synonym votes for its one or more super senses that appear in WORDNET 1.6 . 
Each synonym votes for each of its super senses from WORDNET 1.6 using the similarity score from our synonym extractor . 
For the noun hierarchy , there are 25 lex-files and a file containing the top level nodes in the hierarchy called Tops . 
The most frequent super senses in both test sets were person , attribute and act . 
Otherwise , it is a verb and passes 3 and 4 are repeated to attach subjects and objects . 
This application of semantic similarity demonstrates that an unsupervised methods can outperform supervised methods for some NLP tasks if enough data is available . 
The WORD- NET 1.6 test sets consists of several cross-validation sets of 755 nouns randomly selected from the BLLIP training sets used by Ciaramita and Johnson (
