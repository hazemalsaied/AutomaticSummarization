Table 1 above shows the number of verbs in each class at the end of this process . 
We chose hierarchical clustering because it may be possible to find coherent clusters of verbs even when there are not exactly good clusters , where is the number of classes . 
( See Table 3 for the number of features in the Ling and Seed sets . ) 
In addition to approximating the syntactic frames themselves , we also want to capture regularities in the mapping of arguments to particular slots . 
Currently , our only such feature is an extension of the animate feature of Merlo and Stevenson ( 2001 ) . 
We instead proposed a Semi-supervised methods ins which a seed sets of Verb is chosen for training a supervised classifiers , from
