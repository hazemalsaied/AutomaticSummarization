The results for these feature sets in clustering are given in the second sub column Ling ) under each of the , , and measures in Table 2 . 
We chose hierarchical clustering because it may be possible to find coherent clusters of verbs even when there are not exactly good clusters , where is the number of classes . 
7 5 0 Table 1 : Verb classes ( see Section 3.1 ) , their Levin class numbers , and the number of experimental verbs in each ( see Section 3.2 ) . 
In addition to approximating the syntactic frames themselves , we also want to capture regularities in the mapping of arguments to particular slots . 
We instead proposed a semi-supervised method in which a seed set of verbs is chosen for training a supervised classifier , from which the useful features are extracted for use in clustering . 
We have previously shown that a broad set of 220 noisy features performs well in supervised verb classification ( Joanis and Stevenson , 2003 ) . 
The birds sang in the trees./The trees sang with birds.These activity verbs both have an Agent subject in the in transitive , but differ in the prepositional alternations they allow .
