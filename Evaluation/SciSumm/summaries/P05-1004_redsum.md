They have kindly supplied us with the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set and one cross-validation run of the WORDNET 1.6 test set . 
This work has been supported by a Commonwealth scholarship , Sydney University Travelling Scholarship and Australian Research Council Discovery Project DP0453131 . 
Our development experiments are performed on the WORDNET 1.6 test set with one final run on the WORD- NET 1.7.1 test set . 
The WORD- NET 1.6 test set consists of several cross-validation sets of 755 nouns randomly selected from the BLLIP training set used by Ciaramita and Johnson ( 2003 ) . 
We would like to thank Massi Ciaramita for supplying his original data for these experiments and answering our queries , and to Stephen Clark and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback and corrections . 
They use the common nouns that have been added to WORDNET 1.7.1 since WORDNET 1.6 and compare this evaluation with a standard cross-validation approach that uses a small percentage of the words from their WORDNET 1.6 training set for evaluation . 
The WORDNET 1.7.1 test set consists of 744 previously unseen nouns , the majority of which ( over 90 % ) have only one sense . 
The LDC has recently released the English Gigaword corpus which includes most of the corpora listed above . 
The corpus consists of the British National corpus ( BNC ) , the Reuters corpus Volume 1 ( RCV1 ) , and most of the linguistic Data Consortiumâs news text collected
