Using the CRFs approaches , we prove that it outperformed the character- based method using the CRF approaches . 
We also successfully employed the confidence measure to make a confidence-dependent word segmentation . 
Under the scheme , each character of a word is labeled as âBâ if it is the first character of a multiple-character word , or âOâ if the character functions as an independent word , or âIâ otherwise For example , â ( whole ) ( Beijing city ) â is labeled as â ( whole ) /O ( north ) /B ( capital ) /I ( city ) /Iâ . 
Even with the use of confidence measure , the word- based IOB tagging still outperformed the character-based IOB tagging .
