They have kindly supplied us with the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set and one cross-validation run of the WORDNET 1.6 test set . 
This work has been supported by a Commonwealth scholarship , Sydney University Travelling Scholarship and Australian Research Council Discovery Project DP0453131 . 
We would like to thank Massi Ciaramita for supplying his original data for these experiments and answering our queries , and to Stephen Clark and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback and corrections . 
The LDC has recently released the English Gigaword corpus which includes most of the corpora listed above . 
Each synonym votes for each of its super senses from WORDNET 1.6 using the similarity score from our synonym extractor . 
For the noun hierarchy , there are 25 lex-files and a file containing the top level nodes in the hierarchy called Tops . 
There are many parameters to consider : â¢ how many extracted synonyms to use ; â¢ how to weight each synonyms vote ; â¢ whether unreliable synonyms should be filtered out ; â¢ how to deal with polygamous synonyms . 
The most frequent super senses in both test sets were person , attribute and act . 
In the current system , we must compare a word against the entire vocabulary ( over 500 000 headwords ) , which is much less efficient than a comparison against only 26 superdense context vectors . 
This applications of Semantic Similarity demonstrates that an
