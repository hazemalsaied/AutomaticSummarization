<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Two current approaches to English verb classiÂ­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntacÂ­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning preÂ­ serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The explanation given is that cut describes a series of actions diÂ­ rected at achieving the goal of separating some object into pieces.</a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.</a>

<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The split verbs (cut, draw, kick, knock, push, rip, roll, shove, slip, split, etc.) do not obviously form a homogeneous semanÂ­ tic class.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The adÂ­ junction of the apart adverb adds a change of state semantic component with respect to the object which is not present otherwise.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>It is exactly those verbs that are triple-listed in the split/push/carry intersective class (which have force exertion as a semantic component) that can take the conative.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>However, other intersective classes, such as the split/push/carry class, are no more conÂ­ sistent with WordNet than the original Levin classes.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>However, other intersective classes, such as the split/push/carry class, are no more conÂ­ sistent with WordNet than the original Levin classes.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>However, apart can also be used with other classes of verbs, including many verbs of motion.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>motion Figure 3 shows intersective classes involving two classes of verbs of manner of motion (run and roll verbs) and a class of verbs of existence (meÂ­ ander verbs).</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Roll and run verbs have semanÂ­ tic components describing a manner of motion that typically, though not necessarily, involves change of location.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>For these verbs, we have the inÂ­ duced action alternation by using the light verb fazer (make) before the verb, as in Maria fez o barco flutuar (Mary floated the boat).</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Given the incompleteness of the list of members of Levin classes, each verb must be examined to see whether it exhibits all the alÂ­ ternations of a class.</a>
