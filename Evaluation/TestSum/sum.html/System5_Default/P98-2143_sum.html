<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our work is a continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaphÂ­ ora resolution.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semanÂ­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for realÂ­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowlÂ­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semanÂ­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for realÂ­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowlÂ­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÂ­ maining candidates (see next section).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We regard a noun phrase as definite if the head noun is modified by a definite article, or by demonstrative or possesÂ­ sive pronouns.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>1We use the simple heuristics that the given information is the first noun phrase in a non-imperative sentence.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Lexically reiterated items include reÂ­ peated synonymous noun phrases which may often be preceded by definite articles or demonstratives.</a>

<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>For this purpose we have drawn up a compreÂ­ hensive list of all such cases; to our knowledge, no other computational treatment of pronominal anaphora resoluÂ­ tion has addressed the problem of "agreement excepÂ­ tions".</a>
