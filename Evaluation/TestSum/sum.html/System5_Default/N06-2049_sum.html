<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We defined a cutoff value for each feature type and selected the features with occurrence counts over the cutoff.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A forward-backward algorithm was used in the training and viterbi algorithm was used in the decoding.</a>
