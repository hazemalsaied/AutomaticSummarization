<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, in the CC-domain, 96 keywords are found which have TF/ITF scores above a threshold; some of them are shown in Figure 3.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In the CC-domain, there are 32 sets of phrases which contain more than 2 phrases.</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Although this is not a precise criterion, most cases we evaluated were relatively clear-cut.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Evaluation within a set The evaluation of paraphrases within a set of phrases which share a keyword is illustrated in Figure 4.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We will return to these issues in the discussion section.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This result suggests the benefit of using the automatic discovery method.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>They cluster NE instance pairs based on the words in the contexts using a bag- of-words method.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.</a>
