<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We focus here on extending the applicability of unsupervised methods, as in (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), to the lexical semantic classification of verbs.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Although our motivation is verb class discovery, we perform our experiments on English, for which we have an accepted classification to serve as a gold standard (Levin, 1993).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Like others, we have assumed lexical semantic classes of verbs as defined in Levin (1993) (hereafter Levin), which have served as a gold standard in computational linguistics research (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Kipper et al., 2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002).</a>

<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>However, it gives important information about the quality of a clustering The other measures being equal, a clustering with a higher value indicates tighter and more separated clusters, suggesting stronger inherent patterns in the data.</a>

<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Following Joanis and Stevenson (2003), for each class, we systematically identified the subset of features 4 These results differ slightly from those reported in Joanis and Stevenson (2003), because of our slight changes in verb sets, discussed in Section 3.2.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>We might also ask, would any subset of verbs do as well?</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>We have explored manual, unsupervised, and semi- supervised methods for feature selection in a clustering approach for verb class discovery.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Furthermore, we might question the clustering approach itself, in the context of verb class discovery.</a></body>
