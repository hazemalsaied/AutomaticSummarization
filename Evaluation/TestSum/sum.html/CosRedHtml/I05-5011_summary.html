<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger , the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue . </a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As a later reï¬nement , Sekine ( 2005 ) makes a similar attempt at using distributional similarity over named entity pairs in order to produce a list of fully lexical phrasal paraphrases for specific concepts represented by keywords . </a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In this paper , we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus . </a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>However , those methods need initial seeds , so the relation between entities has to be known in advance . </a>

<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>We agree with Sekine ( 2005 ) who claims that several different methods are required to discover a wider variety of paraphrases . </a>
