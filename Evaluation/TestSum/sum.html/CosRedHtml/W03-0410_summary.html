<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We have previously shown that a broad set of 220 noisy features performs well in supervised verb classification ( Joanis and Stevenson , 2003 ) . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Here we briefly describe the features that comprise our feature space , and refer the interested reader to Joanis and Stevenson ( 2003 ) for details . </a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We then describe our clustering methodology , the measures we use to evaluate a clustering , and our experimental results . </a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>For example , the accuracy measure ( Stevenson and Joanis 2003 ; Korhonen , Krymolowski , and Marx 2003 ) evaluates whether a verb is assigned to a correct cluster with respect to the gold standard class of the majority of cluster members . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In recent work , Stevenson and Joanis ( 2003 ) compared their supervised method for verb classification with supervised and unsupervised techniques . </a>

<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>We use , the mean of the silhouette measure from Matlab , which measures how distant a data point is from other clusters . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Because we make the simplifying assumption of a single correct classification for each verb , we also removed any verb : that was deemed excessively polygamous that belonged to another class under consideration in our study ; or for which the class did not correspond to the main sense . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>We focus here on extending the applicability of unsupervised methods , as in ( Schulte im Walde and Brew , 2002 ; Stevenson and Merlo , 1999 ) , to the lexical semantic classification of verbs . </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Here we briefly describe the features that comprise our feature space , and refer the interested reader to Joanis and Stevenson ( 2003 ) for details . </a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Our second measure , the adjusted Rand measure used by Schulte im Walde ( 2003 ) , instead gives a measure of how consistent the given clustering is overall with respect to the gold standard classification . </a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>However , a general feature space means that most features will be irrelevant to any given verb discrimination task . </a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches have been successful as well , but have tended to be more restrictive , in relying on human filtering of the results ( Riloff and Schmelzenbach , 1998 ) , on the hand- selection of features ( Stevenson and Merlo , 1999 ) , or on the use of an extensive grammar ( Schulte im Walde and Brew , 2002 ) . </a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Because we make the simplifying assumption of a single correct classification for each verb , we also removed any verb : that was deemed excessively polygamous that belonged to another class under consideration in our study ; or for which the class did not correspond to the main sense . </a>

<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>However , it gives important information about the quality of a clustering : The other measures being equal , a clustering with a higher value indicates tighter and more separated clusters , suggesting stronger inherent patterns in the data . </a>
