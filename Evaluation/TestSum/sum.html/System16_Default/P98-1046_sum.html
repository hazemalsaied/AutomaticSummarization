<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>However, the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computaÂ­ tional lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods, although attempts are being made (Pustejovsky, 1991), (Copestake and SanÂ­ filippo, 1993), (Lowe et al., 1997), (Dorr, 1997).</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.</a>

<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Two current approaches to English verb classiÂ­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntacÂ­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning preÂ­ serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).</a>
