<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper , we propose a new approach for the task of mining new word translations from comparable corpora , by combining both context and transliteration information . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If a word e in English is indeed the translation of a word c in Chinese , then we would expect e to be ranked very high in both lists in general . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The work of ( Fung and Yee , 1998 ; Rapp , 1995 ; Rapp , 1999 ) noted that if an English word e is the translation of a Chinese word c , then the contexts of the two words are similar . </a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>elected as follows : For each occurrence of c , we set a window of size 50 characters centered at c. We discarded all the Chinese words in the context that were not in the dictionary we used . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>On the other hand , using our method of combining both sources of information and setting M = â , 19 Chinese words ( i.e. , the first 22 Chinese words in Table 3 except å·´ä½äº å©å æ®å©æ³ have their correct English translations at rank one position . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Being more readily available , comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations , although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>While we have only tested our method on Chinese-English comparable corpora , our method is general and applicable to other language pairs . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For a Chinese source word occurring within a half- month period p , we looked for its English translation candidate words occurring in news documents in the same period p. 5.3 Translation candidates . </a>
