<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations, although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora.</a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Finally, the English candidate word with the smallest average rank position and that appears within the top M positions of both ranked lists is the chosen English translation (as described in Section 2).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The work that is most similar to ours is the recent research of (Huang et al., 2004).</a>
