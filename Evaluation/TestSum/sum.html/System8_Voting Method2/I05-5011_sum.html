<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.</a>

<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>In this subsection, we will report the results of the experiment, in terms of the number of words, phrases or clusters.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically.</a>

<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system.</a>
