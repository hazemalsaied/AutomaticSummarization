<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Starting from a DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem, we present a novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language in order to achieve an eÃÂÃÂcient search algorithm.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task (GermanEnglish, 8000-word vocabulary), which is a limited-domain spoken-language task.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The model is often further restricted so that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word (Brown et al., 1993; Ney et al., 2000).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The alignment model uses two kinds of parameters alignment probabilities p(aj jajÃá¹ÃÂÃÂÃÂ1; I; J), where the probability of alignment aj for position j depends on the previous alignment position ajÃá¹ÃÂÃÂÃÂ1 (Ney et al., 2000) and lexicon probabilities p(fj jeaj ).</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>When aligning the words in parallel texts (for language pairs like SpanishEnglish, French-English, ItalianGerman,...), we typically observe a strong localization effect.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In many cases, there is an even stronger restriction over large portions of the source string, the alignment is monotone.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The inverted alignment probability p(bijbiÃá¹ÃÂÃÂÃÂ1; I; J) and the lexicon probability p(fbi jei) are obtained by relative frequency estimates from the Viterbi alignment path after the final training iteration.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In order to handle the necessary word reordering as an optimization problem within our dynamic programming approach, we describe a solution to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) which is based on dynamic programming (Held, Karp, 1962).</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The algorithm works due to the fact that not all permutations of cities have to be considered explicitly.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The advantage is that we can recombine search hypotheses by dynamic programming.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>For ÃÂÃÂ = 1, a new target language word is generated using the trigram language model p(eje0; e00).</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The complexity of the algorithm is O(E3 J2 2J), where E is the size of the target language vocabulary.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The complexity of the algorithm is O(E3 J2 2J), where E is the size of the target language vocabulary.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The complexity of the algorithm is O(E3 J2 2J), where E is the size of the target language vocabulary.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>In German, the verbgroup usually consists of a left and a right verbal brace, whereas in English the words of the verbgroup usually form a sequence of consecutive words.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>When translating the sentence monotonically from left to right, the translation of the German finite verb 'kann', which is the left verbal brace in this case, is postponed until the German noun phrase 'mein Kollege' is translated, which is the subject of the sentence.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>A position is presented by the word at that position.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>During the search process, a partial hypothesis is extended by choosing a source sentence position, which has not been aligned with a target sentence position yet.</a></body>
