<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>On the other hand, in a translation system one probably wants to treat this string as a single dictionary word since it has a conventional and somewhat unpredictable translation into English.</a>

<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>There are thus some very good reasons why segmentation into words is an important task.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>A minimal requirement for building a Chinese word segmenter is obviously a dictionary; furthermore, as has been argued persuasively by Fung and Wu (1994), one will perform much better at segmenting text by using a dictionary constructed with text of the same genre as the text to be segmented.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>For novel texts, no lexicon that consists simply of a list of word entries will ever be entirely satisfactory, since the list will inevitably omit many constructions that should be considered words.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Among these are words derived by various productive processes, including 1.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>In this paper we present a stochastic finite-state model for segmenting Chinese text into words, both words found in a (static) lexicon as well as words derived via the above-mentioned productive processes.</a>

<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>This latter evaluation compares the performance of the system with that of several human judges since, as we shall show, even people do not agree on a single correct way to segment a text.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>The most accurate characterization of Chinese writing is that it is morphosyllabic (DeFrancis 1984) each hanzi represents one morpheme lexically and semantically, and one syllable phonologiÃÂÃÂ­ cally.</a>

<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>Statistical methods seem particularly applicable to the problem of unknown-word identification, especially for constructions like names, where the linguistic constraints are minimal, and where one therefore wants to know not only that a particular seÃÂÃÂ­ quence of hanzi might be a name, but that it is likely to be a name with some probabilÃÂÃÂ­ ity.</a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>Following Sproat and Shih (1990), performance for Chinese segmentation systems is generally reported in terms of the dual measures of precision and recalP It is fairly standard to report precision and recall scores in the mid to high 90% range.</a>

<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50>Indeed, as we shall show in Section 5, even human judges differ when presented with the task of segmenting a text into words, so a definition of the criteria used to determine that a given segmentation is correct is crucial before one can interpret such measures.</a>
