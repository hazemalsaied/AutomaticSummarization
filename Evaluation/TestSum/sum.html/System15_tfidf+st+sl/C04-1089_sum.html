<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As such, the bilingual lexicon of a machine translation system has to be constantly updated with these new word translations.</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper, we present a new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>But parallel corpora are scarce resources, especially for uncommon lan guage pairs.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations, although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora.</a>
