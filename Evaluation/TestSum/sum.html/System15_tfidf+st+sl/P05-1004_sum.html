<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is a significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001).</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Lexicographers cannot possibly keep pace with language evolution sense distinctions are continually made and merged, words are coined or become obsolete, and technical terms migrate into the vernacular.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or semiautomatic methods for the creation and maintenance of lexical-semantic resources.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Lex-files form a set of coarse-grained sense distinctions within WORDNET.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Supersense tagging is also interesting for many applications that use shallow semantics, e.g. information extraction and question answering.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The other measure they found to be successful was the entropy of the conditional distribution of surrounding words given the noun.</a>
