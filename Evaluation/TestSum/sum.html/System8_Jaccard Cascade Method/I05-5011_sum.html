<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>There has been a lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Also, in Information Extraction (IE), in which the system tries to extract elements of some events (e.g. date and company names of a corporate merger event), several event instances from different news articles have to be aligned even if these are expressed differently.</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.</a>

<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>One possibility is to use n-grams based on mutual information.</a>
