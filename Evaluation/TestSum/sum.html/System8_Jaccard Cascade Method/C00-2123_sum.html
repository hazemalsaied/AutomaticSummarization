<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language.</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The alignment model uses two kinds of parameters alignment probabilities p(aj jajô1; I; J), where the probability of alignment aj for position j depends on the previous alignment position ajô1 (Ney et al., 2000) and lexicon probabilities p(fj jeaj ).</a>

<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>To explicitly handle the word reordering between words in source and target language, we use the concept of the so-called inverted alignments as given in (Ney et al., 2000).</a>

<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>For each source word f, the list of its possible translations e is sorted according to p(fje) puni(e), where puni(e) is the unigram probability of the English word e. It is suÃcient to consider only the best 50 words.</a>
