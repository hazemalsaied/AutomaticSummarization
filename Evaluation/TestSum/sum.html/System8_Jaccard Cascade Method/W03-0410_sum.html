<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We find that the unsupervised method we tried cannot be consistently applied to our data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A number of supervised learning approaches have extracted such information about verbs from corpora, including their argument roles (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), selectional preferences (Resnik, 1996), and lexical semantic classification (i.e., grouping verbs according to their argument structure properties) (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Lapata and Brew, 1999; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Joanis and Stevenson, 2003).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We focus here on extending the applicability of unsupervised methods, as in (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), to the lexical semantic classification of verbs.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We have previously shown that a broad set of 220 noisy features performs well in supervised verb classification (Joanis and Stevenson, 2003).</a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>However, a general feature space means that most features will be irrelevant to any given verb discrimination task.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In this paper, we report results on several feature selection approaches to the problem manual selection (based on linguistic knowledge), unsupervised selection (based on an entropy measure among the features, Dash et al., 1997), and a semi- supervised approach (in which seed verbs are used to train a supervised learner, from which we extract the useful features).</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Although our motivation is verb class discovery, we perform our experiments on English, for which we have an accepted classification to serve as a gold standard (Levin, 1993).</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Here we briefly describe the features that comprise our feature space, and refer the interested reader to Joanis and Stevenson (2003) for details.</a>

<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>We use the same classes and example verbs as in the supervised experiments of Joanis and Stevenson (2003) to enable a comparison between the performance of the unsupervised and supervised methods.</a>

<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>We started with a list of all the verbs in the given classes from Levin, removing any verb that did not occur at least 100 times in our corpus (the BNC, described below).</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Of these verbs, 20 from each class were randomly selected to use as training data for our supervised experiments in Joanis and Stevenson (2003).</a>

<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Then accuracy has the standard definition2 2 is equivalent to the weighted mean precision of the clusters, weighted according to cluster size.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Following Joanis and Stevenson (2003), for each class, we systematically identified the subset of features 4 These results differ slightly from those reported in Joanis and Stevenson (2003), because of our slight changes in verb sets, discussed in Section 3.2.</a></body>
