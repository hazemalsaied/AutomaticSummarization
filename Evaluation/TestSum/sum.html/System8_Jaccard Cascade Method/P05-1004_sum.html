<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only a very small degree of overlap.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every 8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNETâs hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.</a>

<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Our implementation of SEXTANT uses a maximum entropy POS tagger designed to be very efficient, tagging at around 100 000 words per second (Curran and Clark, 2003), trained on the entire Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994).</a></body>
