<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996).</a>

<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntacÂ­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning preÂ­ serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).</a>

<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Whereas high level semantic relations (synÂ­ onym, hypernym) are represented directly in WordNet, they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes, as with the cut/split class.</a>
