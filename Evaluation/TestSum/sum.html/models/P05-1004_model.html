<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Supersense tagging assigns unknown nouns one of 26 broad semantic categories used by lexicographers to organise their manual insertion into WORDNET.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Some specialist topics are better covered in WORD- NET than others, e.g. dog has finer-grained distinctions than cat and worm although this does not reflect finer distinctions in reality; limited coverage of infrequent words and senses.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNETâ€™s hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) implement a super- sense tagger based on the multi-class perceptron classifier (Crammer and Singer, 2001), which uses the standard collocation, spelling and syntactic features common in WSD and named entity recognition systems.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Similarity Vector-space models of similarity are based on the distributional hypothesis that similar words appear in similar contexts.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our approach uses voting across the known supersenses of automatically extracted synonyms, to select a super- sense for the unknown nouns.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Each synonym votes for each of its supersenses from WORDNET 1.6 using the similarity score from our synonym extractor. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Such a corpus is needed to acquire reliable contextual information for the often very rare nouns we are attempting to supersense tag.</a></body>
