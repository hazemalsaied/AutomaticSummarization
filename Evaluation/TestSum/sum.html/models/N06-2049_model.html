<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In addition, the latter can be used to balance out-of-vocabulary rates and in-vocabulary rates.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It is composed of three parts: a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For a character-based IOB tagger, there is only one possibility of re-segmentation.3917</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A confidence measure threshold, t, was defined for making a decision based on the value.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We used the data provided by Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections. </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>For the dictionary-based approach, we extracted a word list from the training data as the vocabulary.798</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Comparing Table 1 and 2, we found the CRF-modeled IOB tagging yielded better segmentation than the dictionary- based approach.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>However, the R-iv rates were getting worse in return for higher R-oov rates.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation.</a></body>
