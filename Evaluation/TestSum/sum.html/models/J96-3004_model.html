<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A Stochastic Finite-State Word-Segmentation Algorithm for Chinese</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>An initial step of any textÂ­ analysis task is the tokenization of the input into words.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Most languages that use Roman, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, or Semitic scripts, and many that use Indian-derived scripts, mark orthographic word boundaries; however, languages written in a Chinese-derived writÂ­ ing system, including Chinese and Japanese, as well as Indian-derived writing systems of languages like Thai, do not delimit orthographic words.1 Put another way, written Chinese simply lacks orthographic words.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In Chinese text, individual characters of the script, to which we shall refer by their traditional name of hanzi,Z are written one after another with no intervening spaces;</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus, if one wants to segment words-for any purpose-from Chinese sentences, one faces a more difficult task than one does in English since one cannot use spacing as a guide.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Making the reasonable assumption that similar information is relevant for solving these problems in Chinese, it follows that a prerequisite for intonation-boundary assignment and prominence assignment is word segmentation.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A minimal requirement for building a Chinese word segmenter is obviously a dictionary; furthermore, as has been argued persuasively by Fung and Wu (1994), one will perform much better at segmenting text by using a dictionary constructed with text of the same genre as the text to be segmented.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this paper we present a stochastic finite-state model for segmenting Chinese text into words</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>There is a sizable literature on Chinese word segmentation: recent reviews include Wang, Su, and Mo (1990) and Wu and Tseng (1993).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Roughly speaking, previous work can be divided into three categories, namely purely statistical approaches, purely lexiÂ­ cal rule-based approaches, and approaches that combine lexical information with staÂ­ tistical information.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The present proposal falls into the last group.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Purely statistical approaches have not been very popular, and so far as we are aware earlier work by Sproat and Shih (1990) is the only published instance of such an approach.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In that work, mutual information was used to decide whether to group adjacent hanzi into two-hanzi words.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Mutual information was shown to be useful in the segmentation task given that one does not have a dictionary.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The most popular approach to dealing with seg­ mentation ambiguities is the maximum matching method, possibly augmented with further heuristics.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>This method, one instance of which we term the &quot;greedy algorithm&quot; in our evaluation of our own system in Section 5, involves starting at the beginning (or end) of the sentence, finding the longest word starting (ending) at that point, and then repeating the process starting at the next (previous) hanzi until the end (begin­ ning) of the sentence is reached.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The simplest version of the maximum matching algorithm effectively deals with ambiguity by ignoring it, since the method is guaranteed to produce only one segmentation.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Methods for expanding the dictionary include, of course, morphological rules, rules for segmenting personal names, as well as numeral sequences, expressions for dates, and so forth (Chen and Liu 1992; Wang, Li, and Chang 1992; Chang and Chen 1993; Nie, Jin, and Hannan 1994).</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Following Sproat and Shih (1990), performance for Chinese segmentation systems is generally reported in terms of the dual measures of precision and recal</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Besides the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a correct segmentation for a given Chinese sentence, there is the more general issue that the test corpora used in these evaluations differ from system to system, so meaningful comparison between systems is rendered even more difficult.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Chinese word segmentation can be viewed as a stochastic transduction problem.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>More formally, we start by representing the dictionary D as a Weighted Finite State TransÂ­ ducer (WFST) (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994).</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>This FSA I can be segmented into words by composing Id(I) with D*, to form the WFST shown in Figure 2(c), then selecting the best path through this WFST to produce the WFST in Figure 2(d).</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>This WFST represents the segmentation of the text into the words AB and CD, word boundaries being marked by arcs mapping between f and part-of-speech labels.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Word frequencies are estimated by a re-estimation procedure that involves apply­ ing the segmentation algorithm presented here to a corpus of 20 million words,8 using 8 Our training corpus was drawn from a larger corpus of mixed-genre text consisting mostly of.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>newspaper material, but also including kungfu fiction, Buddhist tracts, and scientific material.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>This larger corpus was kindly provided to us by United Informatics Inc.,</S</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Foreign names are usually transliterated using hanzi whose sequential pronunciation mimics the source language pronunciation of the name.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Fortunately, there are only a few hundred hanzi that are particularly common in transliterations; indeed, the commonest ones, such as E. bal, m er3, and iij al are often clear indicators that a sequence of hanzi containing them is foreign: even a name like !:i*m xia4mi3-er3 &apos;Shamir,&apos; which is a legal Chi­ nese personal name, retains a foreign flavor because of liM.	</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>As a first step towards modeling transliterated names, we have collected all hanzi occurring more than once in the roughly 750 foreign names in our dictionary, and we estimate the probabil­ ity of occurrence of each hanzi in a transliteration (pTN(hanzi;)) using the maximum likelihood estimate.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Previous reports on Chinese segmentation have invariably cited performance either in terms of a single percent-correct score, or else a single precision-recall pair.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>The problem with these styles of evaluation is that, as we shall demonstrate, even human judges do not agree perfectly on how to segment a given text.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Thus, rather than give a single evaluative score, we prefer to compare the performance of our method with the judgments of several human subjects.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>A greedy algorithm (or maximum-matching algorithm), GR: proceed through the sentence, taking the longest match with a dictionary entry at each point.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>The average agreement among the human judges is .76, and the average agreement between ST and the humans is .75, or about 99% of the interhuman agreement.15</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>The performance was 80.99% recall and 61.83% precision.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>In this paper we have argued that Chinese word segmentation can be modeled efÂ­ fectively using weighted finite-state transducers.</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>In this paper we have argued that Chinese word segmentation can be modeled efÂ­ fectively using weighted finite-state transducers.</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>This architecture provides a uniform framework in which it is easy to incorporate not only listed dictionary entries but also morphological derivatives, and models for personal names and foreign names in transliteration.</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>The major problem for our segÂ­ menter, as for all segmenters, remains the problem of unknown words (see Fung and Wu [1994]).</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>We have provided methods for handling certain classes of unknown words, and models for other classes could be provided, as we have noted.</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>However, there will remain a large number of words that are not readily adduced to any producÂ­ tive pattern and that would simply have to be added to the dictionary.</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>The method reported in this paper makes use solely of unigram probabilities, and is therefore a zeroeth-order model: the cost of a particular segmentation is estimated as the sum of the costs of the individual words in the segmentation.</a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>However, as we have noted, nothing inherent in the approach precludes incorporating higher-order constraints, provided they can be effectively modeled within a finite-state framework.</a>
