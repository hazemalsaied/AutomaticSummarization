<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The character-based Ã¢â¬ÅIOBÃ¢â¬? tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as Ã¢â¬ËBÃ¢â¬â¢ if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or Ã¢â¬ËOÃ¢â¬â¢ if the character functions as an independent word, or Ã¢â¬ËIÃ¢â¬â¢ otherwise.Ã¢â¬? For example, Ã¢â¬? (whole) (Beijing city)Ã¢â¬? is labeled as Ã¢â¬? (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/IÃ¢â¬?.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Taking the same example mentioned above, Ã¢â¬Å (whole) (Beijing city)Ã¢â¬? is labeled as Ã¢â¬? (whole)/O (Beijing)/B (city)/IÃ¢â¬? in the subword-based tagging, where Ã¢â¬? (Beijing)/BÃ¢â¬? is labeled as one unit.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We will give a detailed description of this approach in Section 2.</a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In addition, we found a clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach It yields a very low in-vocabulary (IV) rate (R-iv) in return for a higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate (R-oov).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In this work we propose a confidence measure approach to lessen the weakness.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Section 4 describes current state- of-the-art methods for Chinese word segmentation, with which our results were compared.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>There are several steps to train a subword-based IOB tag- ger.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>We chose all the single characters and the top multi- character words as a lexicon subset for the IOB tagging.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>For example, Ã¢â¬Å (Beijing-city)Ã¢â¬? can be segmented as Ã¢â¬Å (Beijing-city)/O,Ã¢â¬? or Ã¢â¬Å (Beijing)/B (city)/I,Ã¢â¬? or Ã¢â¬? (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/I.Ã¢â¬? In this work we used forward maximal match (FMM) for disambiguation.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>0 means the current word; Ã¢Ëâ1, Ã¢Ëâ2, the first or second word to the left; 1, 2, the first or second word to the right.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>0 means the current word; Ã¢Ëâ1, Ã¢Ëâ2, the first or second word to the left; 1, 2, the first or second word to the right.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>We defined a cutoff value for each feature type and selected the features with occurrence counts over the cutoff.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>However, neither was perfect.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>A confidence measure threshold, t, was defined for making a decision based on the value.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>For the two extreme cases, t = 0 is the case of the IOB tagging while t = 1 is that of the dictionary-based approach.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>We used the data provided by Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections.</a>
