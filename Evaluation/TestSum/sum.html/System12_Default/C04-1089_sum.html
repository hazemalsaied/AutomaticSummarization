<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The work of (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) noted that if an English word e is the translation of a Chinese word c , then the contexts of the two words are similar.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This happened for example when a Chinese word was a non-English person name.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We evaluated our method on each of the 12 half- month periods.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The results when we set M = 10 are shown in Table 1.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>So we estimate that English translations are present in the English part of the corpus for Table 2.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>So we estimate that English translations are present in the English part of the corpus for Table 2.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As mentioned earlier, for the month of Dec 1995, there are altogether 43 Chinese words that have their translations in the English part of the corpus.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>So we estimate that recall (for M = 10) is approximately 115 / 362 = 31.8% . pruning.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Rank of correct translation for period Dec 01 Ã¢â¬â Dec 15 and Dec 16 Ã¢â¬â Dec 31.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>rankÃ¢â¬â¢ is the context rank, Ã¢â¬ËTrans.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Ã¢â¬ËcommÃ¢â¬â¢ means the correct translation is a word appearing in the dictionary we used or is a stop word.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>As shown in Table 3, using just context information alone, 10 Chinese words (the first 10) have their correct English translations at rank one position.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>And using just transliteration information alone, 9 Chinese words have their correct English translations at rank one position.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used only the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>They combined the two sources of information by weighting the two individual scores, whereas we made use of the average rank for combination.</a>
