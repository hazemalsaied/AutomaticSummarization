<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For example , we can easily imagine that the number of paraphrases for âA buys Bâ is enormous and it is not possible to create a comprehensive inventory by hand . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Up to now , most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge ( or IE patterns ) by hand and for specific tasks . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger , the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue . </a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>One of the difficulties in Natural Language Processing is the fact that there are many ways to express the same thing or event . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>As a later reï¬nement , Sekine ( 2005 ) makes a similar attempt at using distributional similarity over named entity pairs in order to produce a list of fully lexical phrasal paraphrases for specific concepts represented by keywords . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The basic strategy is , for a given pair of entity types , to start with some examples , like several famous book title and author pairs ; and find expressions which contains those names ; then using the found expressions , find more author and book title pairs . </a>

<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>In this paper , we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus . </a>

<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>However , those methods need initial seeds , so the relation between entities has to be known in advance . </a>

<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>We agree with Sekine ( 2005 ) who claims that several different methods are required to discover a wider variety of paraphrases . </a>
