<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, we can easily imagine that the number of paraphrases for âA buys Bâ is enormous and it is not possible to create a comprehensive inventory by hand.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.</a>

<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Here a set is represented by the keyword and the number in parentheses indicates the number of shared NE pair instances.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Evaluation within a set The evaluation of paraphrases within a set of phrases which share a keyword is illustrated in Figure 4.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>For each set, the phrases with bracketed frequencies are considered not paraphrases in the set.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>This result suggests the benefit of using the automatic discovery method.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].</a>

<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>The discovered paraphrases can be a big help to reduce human labor and create a more comprehensive pattern set.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system.</a>
