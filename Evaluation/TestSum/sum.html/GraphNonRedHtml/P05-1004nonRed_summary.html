<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Carmita and Johnson ( 2003 ) call this superdense tagging and describe a multi-class perception tagger , which uses WORDNETâs hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the sunset glosses . </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our evaluation will use exactly the same test sets as Ciaramita and Johnson ( 2003 ) . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Carmita and Johnson ( 2003 ) propose a very natural evaluation for superdense tagging : inserting the extra common nouns that have been added to a new version of WORDNET . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Bur- gun and Bodenreider ( 2001 ) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only a very small degree of overlap . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A disadvantage of this similarity approach is that it requires full synonym extraction , which compares the unknown word against a large number of words when , in S Y S T E M W N 1.6 W N 1.7 .1 Cia ra mit a an d Joh nso n bas eli ne 2 1 % 2 8 % Cia ra mit a an d Joh nso n per cep tro n 5 3 % 5 3 % Si mil art y bas ed res ult s 6 8 % 6 3 % Table 6 : Summary of superdense tagging accuracies fact , we want to calculate the similarity to a small number of super senses . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This technique is similar to Hearst and SchuÂ¨ tze ( 1993 ) and Widdows ( 2003 ) . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Broad semantic classification is currently used by lexicographers to or- anise the manual insertion of words into WORDNET , and is an experimental precursor to automatically inserting words directly into the WORDNET hierarchy . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our application of semantic similarity to superdense tagging follows earlier work by Hearst and SchuÂ¨ tze ( 1993 ) and Widdows ( 2003 ) . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Carmita and Johnson ( 2003 ) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by super senses . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our results significantly outperform Ciaramita and Johnson ( 2003 ) on both test sets even though our system is unsupervised . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Does every superdense of each extracted synonym get the whole weight of that synonym or is it distributed evenly between the super senses like Resnik ( 1995 ) ? </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Superdense tagging is also interesting for many applications that use shallow semantics , e.g . information extraction and question answering . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>A considerable amount of research addresses structurally and statistically manipulating the hierarchy of WORD- NET and the construction of new word nets using the concept structure from English . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>For lexical FreeNet , Beefer- man ( 1998 ) adds over 350 000 collocation pairs ( trigger pairs ) extracted from a 160 million words corpus of broadcast news using mutual information . </a></body>
