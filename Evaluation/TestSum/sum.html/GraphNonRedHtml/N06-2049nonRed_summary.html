<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The character-based âIOBâ tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently ( Xue and Shen , 2003 ; Peng and McCallum , 2004 ; Tseng et al. , 2005 ) . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The segmentation results using CRF tagging are shown in Table 2 , where the upper numbers of each slot were produced by the character-based approach while the lower numbers were of the subword-based . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>However , the R-ivs were very high . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>By way of the confidence measure we combined results from the dictionary-based and the IOB-tagging-based and as a result , we could achieve the optimal performance . </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Later , this approach was implemented by the CRF-based method ( Peng and McCallum , 2004 ) , which was proved to achieve better results than the maximum entropy approach because it can solve the label bias problem ( Lafferty et al. , 2001 ) . </a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>For AS corpus , âAdam Smithâ are two words in the training but become a one- word in the test , âAdamSmithâ . </a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>In addition , we found a clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach : It yields a very low in-vocabulary ( IV ) rate ( R-iv ) in return for a higher out-of-vocabulary ( OOV ) rate ( R-oov ) . </a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>After the dictionary- based word segmentation , the words are re-segmented into sub words by FMM before being fed to IOB tagging . </a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>We defined a cutoff value for each feature type and selected the features with occurrence counts over the cutoff . </a>

<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>We downloaded and used the package âCRF++â from the site âhttp //www.chasen.org/Ëtaku/software.â According to the CRFs , the probability of an IOB tag sequence , T = t0 t1 Â· Â· Â· tM , given the word sequence , W = w0 w1 Â· Â· Â· wM , is defined by p ( T |W ) = and current observation ti simultaneously ; gk ( ti , W ) , the epigram feature functions because they trigger only current observation ti . Î»k and Âµk are the model parameters corresponding to feature functions fk and gk respectively . </a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Tri- gram LMs were generated using the SRI LM toolkit for disambiguation . </a>
