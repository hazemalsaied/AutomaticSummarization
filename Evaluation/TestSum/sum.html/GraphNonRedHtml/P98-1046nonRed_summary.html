<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>It is not clear how much WordNet sunsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes , and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy ( Dorr and Jones , 1996 ) , ( Jones and Onyshkevych , 1997 ) , ( Dorr , 1997 ) . </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible ( Jones et al. , 1994 ) , ( Nomura et al. , 1994 ) , ( Saint-Dizier , 1996 ) . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Of course , some Levin classes , such as braid ( bob , braid , brush , clip , cold cream comb , condition , crimp , crop , curl , etc . ) are clearly not intended to be synonymous , which at least partly explains the lack of overlap beÂ­ tween Levin and WordNet . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If only one or two verbs were shared between two classes , we assumed this might be due to hoÂ­ mo phony an idiosyncrasy involving individual verbs rather than a systematic relationship inÂ­ voling coherent sets of verbs . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class memberÂ­ ship . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntacÂ­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning preÂ­ serving ( diathesis alternations ) ( Levin , 1993 ) . </a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Intersection Levin sets partition these classes according to more coÂ­ coherent subsets of features ( force , forestations separation , in effect highlighting a lattice of semantic features that determine the sense of a verb . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>â¢ Although kick is not listed as a verb of exerting force , it displays all the alternations that define this class . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>isolate semantic components Some of the large Levin classes comprise verbs that exhibit a wide range of possible semantic components , and could be divided into smaller subclasses . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Although the Levin classes that make up an intersection class may have conflicting alternaÂ­ sons e.g. , verbs of exerting force can take the donative alternation , while carry verbs can not ) , this does not invalidate the semantic regularity of the intersection class . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Figure 2 : Intersective class formed from Levin carry , pushily and split verbs- verbs in ( ) are not listed by Levin in all the intersecting classes but participate in all the alternations The intersection between the pushily verbs of exerting force , the carry verbs and the split verbs illustrates how the force semantic compoÂ­ net of a verb can also be used to extend its meaning so that one can infer a causation of accompanied motion . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>WordNet is an onÂ­ line lexical database of English that currently contains approximately 120,000 sets of noun , verb , adjective , and adverb synonyms , each repÂ­ resenting a lexical concept . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Figure 1 : Algorithm for identifying relevant semantic-class intersections We then reclassified the verbs in the database as follows . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>We expect these cross-linguistic features to be useful for capturing translation generalizations between languages as discussed in the literaÂ­ pure Palmer and Rosenzweig , 1996 ) , ( CopesÂ­ take and Sanfilippo , 1993 ) , ( Dorr , 1997 ) . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>intersection class Is such that a verb v E Is iff v E c1 n ... n en , and there is no S ' = { d1 , ..â¢ c } such that S C S ' and v E ci n ... n dm ( subset criterion ) . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Levin verb classes are based on an underlying latÂ­ tic of partial semantic descriptions , which are manifested indirectly in diathesis alternations . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>It would be straightÂ­ forward to augment it with pointers indicating which senses are basic to a class of verbs and which can be generated automatically , and inÂ­ clue corresponding syntactic information . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Two current approaches to English verb classiÂ­ fictions are WordNet ( Miller et al. , 1990 ) and Levin classes ( Levin , 1993 ) . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>{ verb of exerting force ; no separation imÂ­ plied , but causation of accompanied motion possible ) 5 . </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>However , the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computaÂ­ tonal lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods , although attempts are being made ( Pustejovsky , 1991 ) , ( Copestake and SanÂ­ Filippo 1993 ) , ( Lowe et al. , 1997 ) , ( Dorr , 1997 ) . </a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The critical point is that , while the verb 's meaning can be extended to either `` attempted '' action or directed motion , these two extensions can not co-occur - they are mutually exclusive . </a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Instead , in their use as split verbs , each verb manifests an extended sense that can be paraphrased as `` separate by V-ing , '' where `` V '' is the basic meaning of that verb ( Levin , 1993 ) . </a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>TAGs have also been applied to PorÂ­ Portuguese in previous work , resulting in a small Portuguese grammar ( Kipper , 1994 ) . </a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Investigating regular sense extensions based on intersective Levin classes</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes , interÂ­ section Levin classes , as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts . </a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Whereas each WordNet sunset is hierarchical ing to only one aspect ( e.g. , Result , in the case of cut ) , Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features , without designating one as primary . </a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Most verbs have more than one translation into Portuguese , so we chose the translation that best described the meaning or that had the same type of arguments as described in Levin 's verb classes . </a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Whereas high level semantic relations ( synÂ­ onyx hypergamy are represented directly in WordNet , they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes , as with the splitting class . </a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Even though the Levin verb classes are defined by their syntactic behavior , many reflect semanÂ­ tic distinctions made by WordNet , a classificaÂ­ son hierarchy defined in terms of purely seÂ­ antic word relations ( synonyms , hypergamy etc . ) . </a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>( verb of exerting force , no separation or causation of accompanied motion implied ) 3 . </a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Given the incompleteness of the list of members of Levin classes , each verb must be examined to see whether it exhibits all the alÂ­ alternation of a class . </a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>A verb was assigned membership in an intersection class if it was listed in each of the existing classes that were combined to form the new intersection class . </a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>2.1 Ambiguities in Levin classes . </a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>The sets of syntactic frames associated with a particular Levin class are not intended to be arbitrary , and they are supposed to reflect unÂ­ underlying semantic components that constrain alÂ­ losable arguments . </a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>These fringe split verbs appear in several other interÂ­ section classes that highlight the force aspect of their meaning . </a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>Levin classes are supposed to provide specific sets of syntactic frames that are associated with the individual classes . </a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>We have presented a refinement of Levin classes , intersection classes , and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses . </a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>The fact that the split sense for these verbs does not appear explicitly in WordNet is not surprising since it is only an extended sense of the verbs , and separation is inferred only when the verb occurs with an appropriate adjunct , such as apart . </a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>As can be seen in Table 2 the alternations for the Portuguese translations of the verbs in this intersection class indicate that they share simiÂ­ lar properties with the English verbs , including the causative . </a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>We have made a preliminary study of the PorÂ­ Portuguese translation of the carry verb class . </a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>What constitutes a clear sepaÂ­ ration into senses for any one verb , and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished ? </a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>This filter alÂ­ lowed us to reject the potential intersection classes that would have resulted from combining the reÂ­ move verb with the scribble verb , for example . </a></body>
