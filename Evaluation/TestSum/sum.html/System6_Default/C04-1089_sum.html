<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1> Comparable corpora such as news documents of the same period from different news agencies are readily available.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In this paper, we present a new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> But parallel corpora are scarce resources, especially for uncommon lan guage pairs.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> In this paper, we propose a new approach for the task of mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining both context and transliteration information.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> The work of (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) noted that if an English word e is the translation of a Chinese word c , then the contexts of the two words are similar.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> The work of (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) noted that if an English word e is the translation of a Chinese word c , then the contexts of the two words are similar.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> The work of (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) noted that if an English word e is the translation of a Chinese word c , then the contexts of the two words are similar.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>  t c t ! t The candidate ei that is ranked the highest according to the average rank is taken to be the cor where t is a term in the corpus, ct is the number rect translation and is output.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> The corpus of the period Jul to Dec 1995 was used to come up with new Chinese words c for translation into English.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used only the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> Koehn and Knight (2002) attempted to combine multiple clues, including similar context and spelling.</a></body>
