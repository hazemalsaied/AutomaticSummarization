<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1> Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The character-based IOB tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> We will give a detailed description of this approach in Section 2.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> We will give a detailed description of this approach in Section 2.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (CRF) for the IOB tagging, yielded very high R-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> This approach will be described in Section 2.2.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> Section 3 presents our experimental results.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> It is composed of three parts a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16> We defined a cutoff value for each feature type and selected the features with occurrence counts over the cutoff.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17> In this section we introduce a confidence measure approach to combine the two results.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18> We used the data provided by Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19> For the dictionary-based approach, we extracted a word list from the training data as the vocabulary.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20> Tri- gram LMs were generated using the SRI LM toolkit for disambiguation.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21> The effect of the confidence measure is shown in Table 3, where we used  = 0.7 and confidence threshold t = 0.8.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22> Even with the use of confidence measure, the word- based IOB tagging still outperformed the character-based IOB tagging.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23> It was first used in Chinese word segmentation by (Xue and Shen, 2003), where maximum entropy methods were used.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24> In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25> Using the CRFs approaches, we prove that it outperformed the character- based method using the CRF approaches.</a></body>
