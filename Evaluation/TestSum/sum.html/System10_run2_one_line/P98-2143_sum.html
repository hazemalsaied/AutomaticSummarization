<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If this does not help, the candidate with the higher score for indicating verbs is preferred.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Whilst some of the indicators are more genre-specific (term prefer? ence) and others are less genre-specific ("immediate reference"), the majority appear to be genre? independent.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Definiteness Definite noun phrases in previous sentences are more likely antecedents of pronominal anaphors than indefinite ones (definite noun phrases score 0 and indefinite ones are penalised by -1).</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Definiteness Definite noun phrases in previous sentences are more likely antecedents of pronominal anaphors than indefinite ones (definite noun phrases score 0 and indefinite ones are penalised by -1).</a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>1We use the simple heuristics that the given information is the first noun phrase in a non-imperative sentence.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Empirical evidence sug? gests that because of the salience of the noun phrases which follow them, the verbs listed above are particularly good indicators.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Lexical reiteration Lexically reiterated items are likely candidates for antecedent (a NP scores 2 if is repeated within the same paragraph twice or more, 1 if repeated once and 0 if not).</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Look for noun phrases3 only to the left of the anaphor4 2.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>3.2 Evaluation B. We carried out a second evaluation of the approach on a different set of sample texts from the genre of technical manuals (47-page Portable Style-Writer User's Guide (Stylewriter 1994).</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>This measure (Mitkov 1998b) applies only to anaphors "ambiguous" from the point of view of number and gender (i.e. to those "tough" anaphors which, after activating the gender and number filters, still have more than one candidate for antecedent) and is indicative of the performance of the antecedent indicators.</a>
