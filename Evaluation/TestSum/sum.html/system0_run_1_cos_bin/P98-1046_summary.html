<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Of course , some Levin classes , such as braid ( bob , braid , brush , clip , cold cream comb , condition , crimp , crop , curl , etc . ) are clearly not intended to be synonymous , which at least partly explains the lack of overlap beÂ­ tween Levin and WordNet . </a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This is an obvious shortcoming of the current implementation of intersecÂ­ tie classes , and might affect the choice of 3 as a relevance cutoff in later implementations . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>WordNet is an onÂ­ line lexical database of English that currently contains approximately 120,000 sets of noun , verb , adjective , and adverb synonyms , each repÂ­ resenting a lexical concept . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class memberÂ­ ship . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If only one or two verbs were shared between two classes , we assumed this might be due to hoÂ­ mo phony an idiosyncrasy involving individual verbs rather than a systematic relationship inÂ­ voling coherent sets of verbs . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Levin classes are supposed to provide specific sets of syntactic frames that are associated with the individual classes . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However , other intersection classes , such as the split/push/carry class , are no more conÂ­ consistent with WordNet than the original Levin classes . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>3.1 Using intersection Levin classes to . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This distinction appears in the second-order Levin classes as membership vs. nonmemberÂ­ ship in the intersection class with split . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Most verbs have more than one translation into Portuguese , so we chose the translation that best described the meaning or that had the same type of arguments as described in Levin 's verb classes . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Given the incompleteness of the list of members of Levin classes , each verb must be examined to see whether it exhibits all the alÂ­ alternation of a class . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The fact that the split sense for these verbs does not appear explicitly in WordNet is not surprising since it is only an extended sense of the verbs , and separation is inferred only when the verb occurs with an appropriate adjunct , such as apart . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Instead , in their use as split verbs , each verb manifests an extended sense that can be paraphrased as `` separate by V-ing , '' where `` V '' is the basic meaning of that verb ( Levin , 1993 ) . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>isolate semantic components Some of the large Levin classes comprise verbs that exhibit a wide range of possible semantic components , and could be divided into smaller subclasses . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>We think that many cases of ambiguÃÂ­ ous classification of the lexical entry for a verb can be addressed with the notion of intersection sets introduced by Dang et al . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Figure 1 : Algorithm for identifying relevant semantic-class intersections We then reclassified the verbs in the database as follows . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>\tVe think that many cases of amÃÂ­ ambiguous classification of verb types can be adÃÂ­ dressed with the notion of intersect sets inÃÂ­ produced by ( Dang ct a ! . , 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>This is exemplified by the Levin cut verbs and the intersection class formed by the cut verbs and split verbs . </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Current approaches to English classificaÂ­ tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limitaÂ­ tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>For inÂ­ stance , carry verbs are described as not taking the donative *The mother carried at the baby , and yet many of the verbs in the carry class { push , pull , tug , shove , kick ) are also listed in the pushily class , which does take the conaÂ­ tie . </a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>LevinÃ¢â¬â¢s ( 1993 ) seminal study on diathesis alternations and verb semantic classes has recently influenced work in dictionary creation ( Dorr 1997 ; Dang et al . 1998 ; Dorr and Jones 1996 ) </a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>These subclasses correspond very well to the English subclasses created by the intersection class . </a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Two current approaches to English verb classiÂ­ fictions are WordNet ( Miller et al. , 1990 ) and Levin classes ( Levin , 1993 ) . </a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>We present a refinement of Levin classes, intersecÃÂ­ tive sets, which are a more fine-grained clasÃÂ­ sification and have more coherent sets of synÃÂ­ tactic frames and associated semantic compoÃÂ­ nents.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Classifications which aim to capture the close relation between the syntax and semantics of verbs have attracted a considerable research interest in both linguistics and computational linguistics ( e.g . </a>

<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>The difficulty of achieving adequate handÂ­ crafted semantic representations has limited the field of natural language processing to applicaÂ­ sons that can be contained within well-defined domains . </a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>The only escape from this limÂ­ imitation will be through the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisiÂ­ son . </a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>However , the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computaÂ­ tonal lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods , although attempts are being made ( Pustejovsky , 1991 ) , ( Copestake and SanÂ­ Filippo 1993 ) , ( Lowe et al. , 1997 ) , ( Dorr , 1997 ) . </a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>They are interpretable as verbs of splitting or separating only in particular synÂ­ tactic frames ( I pulled the twig and the branch apart , I pulled the twig off { of ) the branch , but not *I pulled the twig and the branch ) . </a>

<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>2.1 Ambiguities in Levin classes . </a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>It is not clear how much WordNet sunsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes , and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy ( Dorr and Jones , 1996 ) , ( Jones and Onyshkevych , 1997 ) , ( Dorr , 1997 ) . </a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>Most of these verbs take the same alternations as in English and , by virtue of these alternations , achieve the same regular sense extensions . </a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>We have also examined a mapping between the English verbs that we have discussed and their Portuguese translations , which have sevÂ­ era of the same properties as the corresponding verbs in English . </a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>In this experiment , we have tried to choose the Portuguese verb that is most closely related to the description of the English verb in the Levin class . </a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Words and sunsets are interrelated by means of lexical and semantic-conceptual links , respecÂ­ lively . </a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>( verb of exerting force , no separation or causation of accompanied motion implied ) 3 . </a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>This might be approxiÂ­ mated by automatically extracting the syntacÂ­ tic frames in which the verb occurs in corpus data , rather than manual analysis of each verb , as was done in this study . </a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>One of the most controversial areas has to do with polygamy . </a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>Whereas high level semantic relations ( synÂ­ onyx hypergamy are represented directly in WordNet , they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes , as with the splitting class . </a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>However , it would be useful for the WordNet senses to have access to the detailed syntactic information that the Levin classes contain , and it would be equally useful to have more guidance as to when membership in a Levin class does in fact indicate shared semanÂ­ tic components . </a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>Current approaches to English classificaÂ­ son Levin classes and WordNet , have limitaÂ­ sons in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes . </a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>Does it indicate that more than one sense of the verb is involved , or is one sense primary , and the alternations for that class should take precedence over the alternations for the other classes in which the verb is listed ? </a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>We have presented a refinement of Levin classes , intersection classes , and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses . </a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49>We augmented the existing database of Levin semantic classes with a set of intersection classes , which were created by grouping toÂ­ ether subsets of existing classes with overÂ­ lapping members . </a>
<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50>In this paper we specifically address questions of polygamy with respect to verbs , and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunct of particular syntactic phrases . </a>
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51>For these verbs , we have the inÂ­ duce action alternation by using the light verb faze make ) before the verb , as in Maria fez o Marco ( Mary floated the boat ) . </a>
<a name="52">[52]</a> <a href="#52" id=52>As a verb of exerting force , push can appear in the donative son which emphasizes its force semantic comÂ­ potent and ability to express an `` attempted '' action where any result that might be associÂ­ ated- with the verb ( e.g. , motion ) is not necÂ­ necessarily achieved ; as a carry verb ( used with a goal or directional phrase ) , push can not take the donative , which would conflict with the core meaning of the carry verb class ( i.e. , causation of motion ) . </a>
<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53>What constitutes a clear sepaÂ­ ration into senses for any one verb , and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished ? </a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54>It would be straightÂ­ forward to augment it with pointers indicating which senses are basic to a class of verbs and which can be generated automatically , and inÂ­ clue corresponding syntactic information . </a>
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55>We also plan to experiment with different classification schemes for verb semantics such as WordNet ( Miller et al. , 1990 ) and intersection Levin classes ( Dang et al. , 1998 ) . </a></body>
