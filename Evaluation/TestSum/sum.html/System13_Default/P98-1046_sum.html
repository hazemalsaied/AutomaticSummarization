<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>What constitutes a clear sepaÂ­ ration into senses for any one verb, and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished?</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Two current approaches to English verb classiÂ­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntacÂ­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning preÂ­ serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr, 1997).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The sole member of this intersection is the verb draw.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The adÂ­ junction of the apart adverb adds a change of state semantic component with respect to the object which is not present otherwise.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This is exemplified by the Levin cut verbs and the intersective class formed by the cut verbs and split verbs.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This is exemplified by the Levin cut verbs and the intersective class formed by the cut verbs and split verbs.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Whereas high level semantic relations (synÂ­ onym, hypernym) are represented directly in WordNet, they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes, as with the cut/split class.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>However, other intersective classes, such as the split/push/carry class, are no more conÂ­ sistent with WordNet than the original Levin classes.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>However, other intersective classes, such as the split/push/carry class, are no more conÂ­ sistent with WordNet than the original Levin classes.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>However, apart can also be used with other classes of verbs, including many verbs of motion.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Some manner of motion verbs allow a transitive alternation in addition to the basic inÂ­ transitive.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Some manner of motion verbs allow a transitive alternation in addition to the basic inÂ­ transitive.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>These verbs are listed in the intersective classes with meander verbs of existence.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>These verbs are listed in the intersective classes with meander verbs of existence.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Most of these verbs take the same alternations as in English and, by virtue of these alternations, achieve the same regular sense extensions.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>In this experiment, we have tried to choose the Portuguese verb that is most closely related to the description of the English verb in the Levin class.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>We expect these cross-linguistic features to be useful for capturing translation generalizations between languages as discussed in the literaÂ­ ture (Palmer and Rosenzweig, 1996), (CopesÂ­ take and Sanfilippo, 1993), (Dorr, 1997).</a>
