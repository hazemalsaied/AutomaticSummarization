<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There has been a lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>There has been a lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As we shall see, most of the linked sets are paraphrases.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If the same pair of NE instances is used with different phrases, these phrases are likely to be paraphrases.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In this subsection, we will report the results of the experiment, in terms of the number of words, phrases or clusters.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We will describe the evaluation of such clusters in the next subsection.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Evaluation within a set The evaluation of paraphrases within a set of phrases which share a keyword is illustrated in Figure 4.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The results, along with the total number of phrases, are shown in Table 1.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This result suggests the benefit of using the automatic discovery method.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Evaluation results for links</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>There has also been work using a bootstrap- ping approach [Brin 98; Agichtein and Gravano 00; Ravichandran and Hovy 02].</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Also, the method of using keywords rules out phrases which donât contain popular words in the domain.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Also, the method of using keywords rules out phrases which donât contain popular words in the domain.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Applications The discovered paraphrases have multiple applications.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.</a>
