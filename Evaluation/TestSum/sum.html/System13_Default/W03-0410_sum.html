<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The first subcolumn (Full) under each of the three clustering evaluation measures in Table 2 shows the results using the full set of features (i.e., no feature selection).</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Many feature sets performed very well, and some far outperformed our best results using other feature selection methods.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Each clustering experiment used the full set of 20 verbs per class; i.e., seed verbs were included, following our proposed model of guided verb class discovery.5 The results using these feature sets are shown in the third subcolumn (Seed) under our three evaluation measures in Table 2.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>However, not just any small set of features is adequate.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>To answer this, we ran experiments using 50 different randomly selected seed verb sets for each class.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Furthermore, we might question the clustering approach itself, in the context of verb class discovery.</a></body>
