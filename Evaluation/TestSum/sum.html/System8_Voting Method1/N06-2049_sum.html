<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.</a>
