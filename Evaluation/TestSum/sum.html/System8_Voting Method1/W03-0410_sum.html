<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>In this paper, we report results on several feature selection approaches to the problem manual selection (based on linguistic knowledge), unsupervised selection (based on an entropy measure among the features, Dash et al., 1997), and a semi- supervised approach (in which seed verbs are used to train a supervised learner, from which we extract the useful features).</a>

<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Each clustering experiment used the full set of 20 verbs per class; i.e., seed verbs were included, following our proposed model of guided verb class discovery.5 The results using these feature sets are shown in the third subcolumn (Seed) under our three evaluation measures in Table 2.</a></body>
