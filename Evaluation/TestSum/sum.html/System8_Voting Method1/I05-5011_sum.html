<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Also, in Information Extraction (IE), in which the system tries to extract elements of some events (e.g. date and company names of a corporate merger event), several event instances from different news articles have to be aligned even if these are expressed differently.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>For example, we can easily imagine that the number of paraphrases for âA buys Bâ is enormous and it is not possible to create a comprehensive inventory by hand.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [Sekine et al. 2004].</a>

<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>As can be seen in the example, the first two phrases have a different order of NE names from the last two, so we can determine that the last two phrases represent a reversed relation.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].</a>

<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>The discovered paraphrases can be a big help to reduce human labor and create a more comprehensive pattern set.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically.</a></body>
