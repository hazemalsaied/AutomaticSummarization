<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÂ­ maining candidates (see next section).</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>those which agree in gender and numberS with the pronominal anaphor and group them as a set of potential candidates</a>

<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the apÂ­ proach and to explore if I how far it is superior over the baseline models for anaphora resolution, we also tested the sample text on (i) a Baseline Model which checks agreement in number and gender and, where more than one candidate remains, picks as anteceÂ­ dent the most recent subject matching the gender and number of the anaphor (ii) a Baseline Model which picks as antecedent the most recent noun phrase that matches the gender and number of the anaphor.</a>

<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The relaÂ­ tively low figures for the majority of indicators should not be regarded as a surprise firstly, we should bear in mind that in most cases a candidate was picked (or rejected) as an antecedent on the baÂ­ sis of applying a number of different indicators and secondly, that most anaphors had a relatively high number of candidates for antecedent.</a>

<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>It would be fair to say that even though the results show superiority of our approach on the training data used (the genre of technical manuals), they cannot be generalised automatically for other genres or unrestricted texts and for a more accurate picture, further extensive tests are necessary.</a>

<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Similarly to the evaluation for English, we comÂ­ pared the approach for Polish with (i) a Baseline Model which discounts candidates on the basis of agreement in number and gender and, if there were still competing candidates, selects as the antecedent the most recent subject matching the anaphor in gender and number (ii) a Baseline Model which checks agreement in number and gender and, if there were still more than one candidate left, picks up as the antecedent the most recent noun phrase that agrees with the anaphor.</a>
