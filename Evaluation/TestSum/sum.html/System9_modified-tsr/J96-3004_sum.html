<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Finally, quite a few hanzi are homographs, meaning that they may be pronounced in several different ways, and in extreme cases apparently represent different morphemes The prenominal modifiÂ­ cation marker eg deO is presumably a different morpheme from the second morpheme of Â§eg mu4di4, even though they are written the same way.4 The second point, which will be relevant in the discussion of personal names in Section 4.4, relates to the internal structure of hanzi.</a>
