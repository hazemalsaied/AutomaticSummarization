<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We are given a source string fJ 1 = f1fj fJ of length J, which is to be translated into a target string eI 1 = e1eieI of length I. Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability ^eI 1 = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1jfJ 1 )g = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1) Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1)g  (1) The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language.</a>
