<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Rather than trying to separate a set of new verbs into coherent clusters, we suggest that it may be useful to perform a nearest-neighbour type of classification using a seed set, asking for each new verb âis it like these or not?â In some ways our current clustering task is too easy, because all of the verbs are from one of the target classes.</a></body>
