While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired.
Our word segmentation process is illustrated in Fig.

In the third step, we used the CRFs approach to train the IOB tagger (Lafferty et al., 2001) on the training data.
The types of unigram features used in our experiments included the following types w0 , wâ1 , w1 , wâ2 , w2 , w0 wâ1 , w0 w1 , wâ1 w1 , wâ2 wâ1 , w2 w0 where w stands for word.
In this section we introduce a confidence measure approach to combine the two results.
If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used.
Since this work was to evaluate the proposed subword-based IOB tagging, we carried out the closed test only.

It was first used in Chinese word segmentation by (Xue and Shen, 2003), where maximum entropy methods were used.
We could yield a better results than those shown in Table 4 using such information.
In this work we used it more delicately.
In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation.
Using the CRFs approaches, we prove that it outperformed the character- based method using the CRF approaches.
