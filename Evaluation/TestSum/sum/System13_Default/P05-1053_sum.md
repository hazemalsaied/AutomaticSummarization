This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking.

We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance.
For example, we want to determine whether a person is at a location, based on the evidence in the context.
This paper focuses on the ACE RDC task and employs diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet (Miller 1990) and Name List can be used in the feature-based framework.
Zelenko et al (2003) proposed extracting relations by computing kernel functions between parse trees.
Culotta et al (2004) extended this work to estimate kernel functions between augmented dependency trees and achieved 63.2 F-measure in relation detection and 45.8 F-measure in relation detection and classification on the 5 ACE relation types.
It achieves 52.8 F- measure on the 24 ACE relation subtypes.
Compared with Kambhatla (2004), we separately incorporate the base phrase chunking information, which contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a supervised machine learning technique motivated by the statistical learning theory (Vapnik 1998).

Moreover, we only apply the simple linear kernel, although other kernels can peform better.

The semantic relation is determined between two mentions.
For each pair of mentions3, we compute various lexical, syntactic and semantic features.

Normally, the above overlap features are too general to be effective alone.
This category of features includes information about the words, part-of-speeches and phrase labels of the words on which the mentions are dependent in the dependency tree derived from the syntactic full parse tree.
This category of features concerns about the information inherent only in the full parse tree.
Semantic information from various resources, such as WordNet, is used to classify important words into different semantic lists according to their indicating relationships.
â¢ SC1ET2 combination of the entity type of M2 and the semantic class of M1 when the first mention triggers a personal social subtype.
In this paper, we only model explicit relations because of poor inter-annotator agreement in the annotation of implicit relations and their limited number.
Table 2 also measures the contributions of different features by gradually increasing the feature set.

This may be due to the fact that most of relations in the ACE corpus are quite local.
While short-distance relations dominate and can be resolved by above simple features, the dependency tree and parse tree features can only take effect in the remaining much less long-distance relations.
The tree kernels developed in Culotta et al (2004) are yet to be effective on the ACE RDC task.

In this paper, we have presented a feature-based approach for relation extraction where diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge are employed.
This may be due to three reasons First, most of relations defined in ACE have two mentions being close to each other.

Therefore, it would be interesting to see how imperfect EDT affects the performance in relation extraction.
