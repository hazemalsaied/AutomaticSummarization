In this paper, we present a new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information.
Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).
Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).

We fully implemented our method and tested it on ChineseEnglish comparable corpora.
We translated Chinese words into English.
We translated Chinese words into English.
If an English word e is the translation of a Chinese word c , they will have similar contexts.
Since we are using comparable corpora, it is possible that the translation of a new word does not exist in the target corpus.

We used a ChineseEnglish dictionary which contained about 10,000 entries for translating the words in the context.
Our method is not able to find 43 (329 + 205) Ã 4499 = 362words in all 12 pe these translations.
And using just transliteration information alone, 9 Chinese words have their correct English translations at rank one position.
Hence, our method of using both sources of information outperforms using either information source alone.
As pointed out earlier, most previous research only considers either transliteration or context information in determining the translation of a source language word w, but not both sources of information.
The work that is most similar to ours is the recent research of (Huang et al., 2004).
