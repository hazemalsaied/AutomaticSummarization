However, to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense.
Our work is a continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaphÂ­ ora resolution.
It is also an example of how anaphors in a specific genre can be resolved quite successfully without any sophisticated linguistic knowledge or even without parsing.
The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÂ­ maining candidates (see next section).
Antecedent indicators (preferences) play a decisive role in tracking down the antecedent from a set of possible candidates.
Press iti again.
Immediate reference In technical manuals the "immediate reference" clue can often be useful in identifying the antecedent.
As already mentioned, each of the antecedent inÂ­ dicators assigns a score with a value {-1, 0, 1, 2}.
The algorithm for pronoun resolution can be deÂ­ scribed informally as follows 1.

Evaluation.

A case where the system failed was when the anaphor and the antecedent were in the same senÂ­ tence and where preference was given to a candidate in the preceding sentence.
The results from experiment 1 and experiment 2 can be summarised in the following (statistically) slightly more representative figures.
The reason is that both our approach and Breck Baldwin's approach share common principles (both are knowledge-poor and use a POS tagger to provide the input) and therefore a comparison would be appropriate.
This result is comparable with the results described in (Baldwin 1997).
For the training data from the genre of technical manuals, it was rule 5 (see Baldwin 1997) which was most frequently used (39% of the cases, 100% success), followed by rule 8 (33% of the cases, 33% success), rule 7 (11%, 100%), rule I (9%, 100%) and rule 3 (7.4%, 100%).

For the time being, we are using the same scores for Polish.
Our preference-based approach showed clear suÂ­ periority over both baseline models.

We have described a robust, knowledge-poor apÂ­ proach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger.
We have also adapted and evaluated the approach for Polish (93.3 % success rate) and for Arabic (95.2% success rate).
