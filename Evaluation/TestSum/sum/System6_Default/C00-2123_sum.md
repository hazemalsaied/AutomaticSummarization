 The model is often further restricted so that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word (Brown et al., 1993; Ney et al., 2000).

 This approach is compared to another reordering scheme presented in (Berger et al., 1996).
 To explicitly handle the word reordering between words in source and target language, we use the concept of the so-called inverted alignments as given in (Ney et al., 2000).

 For a trigram language model, the partial hypotheses are of the form (e0; e; C; j).
 A position is presented by the word at that position.
 Covering the first uncovered position in the source sentence, we use the language model probability p(ej$; $).
 The proof is given in (Tillmann, 2000).
 Restrictions We compare our new approach with the word reordering used in the IBM translation approach (Berger et al., 1996).

 For each source word f, the list of its possible translations e is sorted according to p(fje) puni(e), where puni(e) is the unigram probability of the English word e. It is sucient to consider only the best 50 words.
 Translation errors are reported in terms of multireference word error rate (mWER) and subjective sentence error rate (SSER).

 In this paper, we have presented a new, ecient DP-based search procedure for statistical machine translation.
