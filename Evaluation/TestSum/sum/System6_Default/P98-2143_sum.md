 Input is checked against agreement and for a number of antecedent indicators.
 Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent.
 Evaluation reports a success rate of 89.7% which is better than the suc cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data.
 Our work is a continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaph ora resolution.
 It is also an example of how anaphors in a specific genre can be resolved quite successfully without any sophisticated linguistic knowledge or even without parsing.
 Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).
 It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as "antecedent indicators").
 The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the re maining candidates (see next section).
 The antecedent indicators have been identi fied empirically and are related to salience (definiteness, givenness, indicating verbs, lexical reiteration, section heading preference, "non prepositional" noun phrases), to structural matches (collocation, immediate reference), to referential distance or to preference of terms.
 Example Insert the cassettei into the VCR making sure iti is suitable for the length of recording.
 The collocation preference here is restricted to the patterns "noun phrase (pronoun), verb" and "verb, noun phrase (pronoun)".
 Immediate reference In technical manuals the "immediate reference" clue can often be useful in identifying the antecedent.
 This preference can be viewed as a modification of the collocation preference.
 There might be cases where one or more of the antecedent indicators do not "point" to the correct antecedent.

 For practical reasons, the approach presented does not incorporate syntactic and semantic information (other than a list of domain terms) and it is not real istic to expect its performance to be as good as an approach which makes use of syntactic and semantic knowledge in terms of constraints and preferences.
 The lack of syntactic information, for instance, means giving up c-cornmand constraints and subject preference (or on other occasions object preference, see Mitkov I995) which could be used in center tracking.
 There were 71 pronouns in the 140 page technical manual; 7 of the pronouns were non-anaphoric and 16 exophoric.
 From this example we can also see that our knowledge-poor approach successfully tackles cases in which the anaphor and the antecedent have not only different syntactic functions but also different semantic roles.
 Usually knowledge-based ap proaches have difficulties in such a situation because they use preferences such as "syntactic parallelism" or "semantic parallelism".
 Our robust approach does not use these because it has no information about the syntactic structure of the sentence or about the syn tactic function/semantic role of each individual word.
 The evaluation carried out was manual to ensure that no added error was gen erated (e.g. due to possible wrong sentence/clause detection or POS tagging).
 This measure (Mitkov 1998b) applies only to anaphors "ambiguous" from the point of view of number and gender (i.e. to those "tough" anaphors which, after activating the gender and number filters, still have more than one candidate for antecedent) and is indicative of the performance of the antecedent indicators.

 The reason is that both our approach and Breck Baldwin's approach share common principles (both are knowledge-poor and use a POS tagger to provide the input) and therefore a comparison would be appropriate.
