Mining New Word Translations from Comparable Corpora
 Comparable corpora such as news documents of the same period from different news agencies are readily available.
 In this paper, we present a new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information.
 But parallel corpora are scarce resources, especially for uncommon lan guage pairs.
 Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).

 On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.
 In this paper, we propose a new approach for the task of mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining both context and transliteration information.
 The work of (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) noted that if an English word e is the translation of a Chinese word c , then the contexts of the two words are similar.

  t c t ! t The candidate ei that is ranked the highest according to the average rank is taken to be the cor where t is a term in the corpus, ct is the number rect translation and is output.
 The corpus of the period Jul to Dec 1995 was used to come up with new Chinese words c for translation into English.
 On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used only the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.
 Koehn and Knight (2002) attempted to combine multiple clues, including similar context and spelling.
