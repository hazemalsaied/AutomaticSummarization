The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is a significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.
Supersense tagging assigns unknown nouns one of 26 broad semantic categories used by lexicographers to organise their manual insertion into WORDNET.

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present a tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.
Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only a very small degree of overlap.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNETâs hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) implement a super- sense tagger based on the multi-class perceptron classifier (Crammer and Singer, 2001), which uses the standard collocation, spelling and syntactic features common in WSD and named entity recognition systems.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) propose a very natural evaluation for supersense tagging inserting the extra common nouns that have been added to a new version of WORDNET.

Our evaluation will use exactly the same test sets as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).
This is not surprising since these concrete words tend to have very fewer other senses, well constrained contexts and a relatively high frequency.
