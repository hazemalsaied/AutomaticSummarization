We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.

Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.
For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.
In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.
We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.

Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword.
In this subsection, we will report the results of the experiment, in terms of the number of words, phrases or clusters.
buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.
There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.
One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].
Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].
Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.
Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically.

While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system.
