It is also an example of how anaphors in a specific genre can be resolved quite successfully without any sophisticated linguistic knowledge or even without parsing.
Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).
With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semanÂ­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for realÂ­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowlÂ­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.

It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as "antecedent indicators").
The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÂ­ maining candidates (see next section).

tial candidate and assign scores; the candidate with the highest aggregate score is proposed as 3A sentence splitter would already have segmented the text into sentences, a POS tagger would already have determined the parts of speech and a simple phrasal grammar would already have detected the noun phrases 4In this project we do not treat cataphora; non-anaphoric "it" occurring in constructions such as "It is important", "It is necessary" is eliminated by a "referential filter" 5Note that this restriction may not always apply in lanÂ­ guages other than English (e.g. German); on the other hand, there are certain collective nouns in English which do not agree in number with their antecedents (e.g. "government", "team", "parliament" etc. can be referred to by "they"; equally some plural nouns (e.g. "data") can be referred to by "it") and are exempted from the agreeÂ­ ment test.
For practical reasons, the approach presented does not incorporate syntactic and semantic information (other than a list of domain terms) and it is not realÂ­ istic to expect its performance to be as good as an approach which makes use of syntactic and semantic knowledge in terms of constraints and preferences.
The lack of syntactic information, for instance, means giving up c-cornmand constraints and subject preference (or on other occasions object preference, see Mitkov I995) which could be used in center tracking.

Lack of semantic knowledge rules out the use of verb seÂ­ mantics and semantic parallelism.
In fact, our evaluation shows that the reÂ­ sults are comparable to syntax-based methods (Lappin & Leass I994).
3.1 Evaluation A. Our first evaluation exercise (Mitkov & Stys 1997) was based on a random sample text from a technical manual in English (Minolta 1994).
3.1 Evaluation A. Our first evaluation exercise (Mitkov & Stys 1997) was based on a random sample text from a technical manual in English (Minolta 1994).
The aggregate score for "the drawer" is 7 (definiteness 1 + givenness 0 + term preference 1 + indicating verbs I + lexical reiteration 0 + section heading 0 + collocation 0 + referential distance 2 + non-prepositional noun phrase 0 + immediate referÂ­ ence 2 = 7), whereas aggregate score for the most recent matching noun phrase ("the lit paper port LED") is 4 (definiteness 1 + givenness 0 + term preference I + indicating verbs 0 + lexical reiteraÂ­ tion 0 + section heading 0 + collocation 0 + referenÂ­ tial distance 2 + non-prepositional noun phrase 0 + immediate reference 0 = 4).
The evaluation carried out was manual to ensure that no added error was genÂ­ erated (e.g. due to possible wrong sentence/clause detection or POS tagging).
Note that "Baseline subject" can be assessed both in terms of recall and precision because this "version" is not robust in the event of no subject being available, it is not able to propose an antecedent (the manual guide used as evaluation text contained many imÂ­ perative zero-subject sentences).
This measure (Mitkov 1998b) applies only to anaphors "ambiguous" from the point of view of number and gender (i.e. to those "tough" anaphors which, after activating the gender and number filters, still have more than one candidate for antecedent) and is indicative of the performance of the antecedent indicators.

A case where the system failed was when the anaphor and the antecedent were in the same senÂ­ tence and where preference was given to a candidate in the preceding sentence.

The reason is that both our approach and Breck Baldwin's approach share common principles (both are knowledge-poor and use a POS tagger to provide the input) and therefore a comparison would be appropriate.
Given that our approach is robust and returns anÂ­ tecedent for each pronoun, in order to make the comparison as fair as possible, we used CogNIAC's "resolve all" version by simulating it manually on the same training data used in evaluation B above.
This result is comparable with the results described in (Baldwin 1997).
For the training data from the genre of technical manuals, it was rule 5 (see Baldwin 1997) which was most frequently used (39% of the cases, 100% success), followed by rule 8 (33% of the cases, 33% success), rule 7 (11%, 100%), rule I (9%, 100%) and rule 3 (7.4%, 100%).
The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolvÂ­ ing anaphors (with critical success rate of 86.2%).
Similarly to the evaluation for English, we comÂ­ pared the approach for Polish with (i) a Baseline Model which discounts candidates on the basis of agreement in number and gender and, if there were still competing candidates, selects as the antecedent the most recent subject matching the anaphor in gender and number (ii) a Baseline Model which checks agreement in number and gender and, if there were still more than one candidate left, picks up as the antecedent the most recent noun phrase that agrees with the anaphor.
