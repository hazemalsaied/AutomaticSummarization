Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation
We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.

By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.
The character-based âIOBâ tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).

In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (CRF) for the IOB tagging, yielded very high R-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.

In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method.
It is composed of three parts a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging.
First, we extracted a word list from the training data sorted in decreasing order by their counts in the training 193 Proceedings of the Human Language Technology Conference of the North American Chapter of the ACL, pages 193â196, New York, June 2006.

We used the data provided by Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections.
The upper numbers are of the character- based and the lower ones, the subword-based.

In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation.
