We see verb classes as the key to making genÂ­ eralizations about regular extensions of meanÂ­ ing.
We present a refinement of Levin classes, intersecÂ­ tive sets, which are a more fine-grained clasÂ­ sification and have more coherent sets of synÂ­ tactic frames and associated semantic compoÂ­ nents.

We also have begun to exÂ­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties.
However, the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computaÂ­ tional lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods, although attempts are being made (Pustejovsky, 1991), (Copestake and SanÂ­ filippo, 1993), (Lowe et al., 1997), (Dorr, 1997).
We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.

Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996).
However, we have found interesting parÂ­ allels in how Portuguese and English treat regÂ­ ular sense extensions.

Two current approaches to English verb classiÂ­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).

A synset (syn onym set) contains, besides all the word forms that can refer to a given concept, a definitional gloss and - in most cases - an example sentence.
Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntacÂ­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning preÂ­ serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).
The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class memberÂ­ ship.

Levin classes are supposed to provide specific sets of syntactic frames that are associated with the individual classes.
It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr, 1997).

A verb was assigned membership in an intersective class if it was listed in each of the existing classes that were combined to form the new intersective class.

Whereas high level semantic relations (synÂ­ onym, hypernym) are represented directly in WordNet, they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes, as with the cut/split class.
Verbs in the slide/roll/run intersecÂ­ tion are also allowed to appear in the dative alternation (Carla slid the book to Dale, Carla slid Dale the book), in which the sense of change of location is extended to change of possession.When used intransitively with a path prepo sitional phrase, some of the manner of motion verbs can take on a sense of pseudo-motional existence, in which the subject does not actuÂ­ ally move, but has a shape that could describe a path for the verb (e.g., The stream twists through the valley).
Whereas each WordNet synset is hierarchicalized accordÂ­ ing to only one aspect (e.g., Result, in the case of cut), Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features, without designating one as primary.
This might be approxiÂ­ mated by automatically extracting the syntacÂ­ tic frames in which the verb occurs in corpus data, rather than manual analysis of each verb, as was done in this study.
In pursuing this goal, we are currently implementÂ­ ing features for motion verbs in the English Tree-Adjoining Grammar, TAG (Bleam et al., 1998).
