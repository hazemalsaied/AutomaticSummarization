Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).
With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semanÂ­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for realÂ­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowlÂ­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.

The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÂ­ maining candidates (see next section).
If this does not help, the candidate with the higher score for indicating verbs is preferred.
Immediate reference In technical manuals the "immediate reference" clue can often be useful in identifying the antecedent.

For practical reasons, the approach presented does not incorporate syntactic and semantic information (other than a list of domain terms) and it is not realÂ­ istic to expect its performance to be as good as an approach which makes use of syntactic and semantic knowledge in terms of constraints and preferences.
There were 71 pronouns in the 140 page technical manual; 7 of the pronouns were non-anaphoric and 16 exophoric.
The success rate of the "Baseline Subject" was 29.2%, whereas the success rate of "Baseline Most Recent NP" was 62.5%.
The reason is that both our approach and Breck Baldwin's approach share common principles (both are knowledge-poor and use a POS tagger to provide the input) and therefore a comparison would be appropriate.
Our evaluaÂ­ tion, based on 63 examples (anaphors) from a techÂ­ nical manual (Sony 1992), indicates a success rate of 95.2% (and critical success rate 89.3 %).
We have described a robust, knowledge-poor apÂ­ proach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger.
