The relation extraction task was formulated at the 7th Message Understanding Conference (MUC7 1998) and is starting to be addressed more and more within the natural language processing and machine learning communities.

Compared with Kambhatla (2004), we separately incorporate the base phrase chunking information, which contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect.
We also show how semantic information like WordNet and Name List can be equipped to further improve the performance.
Therefore, we must extend SVMs to multi-class (e.g. K) such as the ACE RDC task.
For each pair of mentions3, we compute various lexical, syntactic and semantic features.

In this paper, we only model explicit relations because of poor inter-annotator agreement in the annotation of implicit relations and their limited number.

â¢ Chunking features are very useful.
This is largely due to incorporation of two semantic resources, i.e. the country name list and the personal relative trigger word list.
It also shows that feature-based methods dramatically outperform kernel methods.
The tree kernels developed in Culotta et al (2004) are yet to be effective on the ACE RDC task.
