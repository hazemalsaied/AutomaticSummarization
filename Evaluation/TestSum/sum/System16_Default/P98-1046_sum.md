However, the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computaÂ­ tional lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods, although attempts are being made (Pustejovsky, 1991), (Copestake and SanÂ­ filippo, 1993), (Lowe et al., 1997), (Dorr, 1997).
We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.

Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996).

Two current approaches to English verb classiÂ­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).
Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntacÂ­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning preÂ­ serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).
The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class memberÂ­ ship.

2.1 Ambiguities in Levin classes.
This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.
If only one or two verbs were shared between two classes, we assumed this might be due to hoÂ­ mophony, an idiosyncrasy involving individual verbs rather than a systematic relationship inÂ­ volving coherent sets of verbs.
