Our approach uses word-to-word dependencies between source and target words.

The model is often further restricted so that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word (Brown et al., 1993; Ney et al., 2000).

We use a solution to this problem similar to the one presented in (Och et al., 1999), where target words are joined during training.
An extended lexicon model is defined, and its likelihood is compared to a baseline lexicon model, which takes only single-word dependencies into account.
Restrictions Quasi-monotone Search The above search space is still too large to allow the translation of a medium length input sentence.
