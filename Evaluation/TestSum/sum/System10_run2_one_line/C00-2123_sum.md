We are given a source string fJ 1 = f1fj fJ of length J, which is to be translated into a target string eI 1 = e1eieI of length I. Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability ^eI 1 = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1jfJ 1 )g = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1) Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1)g  (1) The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language.

For the translation model Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1), we go on the assumption that each source word is aligned to exactly one target word.

The baseline alignment model does not permit that a source word is aligned to two or more target words, e.g. for the translation direction from German toEnglish, the German compound noun 'Zahnarztter min' causes problems, because it must be translated by the two target words dentist's appointment.

An extended lexicon model is defined, and its likelihood is compared to a baseline lexicon model, which takes only single-word dependencies into account.
e0; e are the last two target words, C is a coverage set for the already covered source positions and j is the last position visited.

Restrictions Quasi-monotone Search The above search space is still too large to allow the translation of a medium length input sentence.
On the other hand, only very restricted reorderings are necessary, e.g. for the translation direction from Table 2 Coverage set hypothesis extensions for the IBM reordering.
