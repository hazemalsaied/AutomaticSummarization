Our work is a continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaphÂ­ ora resolution.
With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semanÂ­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for realÂ­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowlÂ­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.
With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semanÂ­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for realÂ­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowlÂ­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.
The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÂ­ maining candidates (see next section).
We regard a noun phrase as definite if the head noun is modified by a definite article, or by demonstrative or possesÂ­ sive pronouns.
1We use the simple heuristics that the given information is the first noun phrase in a non-imperative sentence.
Lexically reiterated items include reÂ­ peated synonymous noun phrases which may often be preceded by definite articles or demonstratives.
This preference can be explained in terms of saliÂ­ ence from the point of view of the centering theory.
The collocation preference here is restricted to the patterns "noun phrase (pronoun), verb" and "verb, noun phrase (pronoun)".

To turn on the printer, press the Power buttoni and hold iti down for a moment.
As already mentioned, each of the antecedent inÂ­ dicators assigns a score with a value {-1, 0, 1, 2}.
There might be cases where one or more of the antecedent indicators do not "point" to the correct antecedent.

For inÂ­ stance, in the sentence "Insert the cassette into the VCRi making sure iti is turned on", the indicator "non-prepositional noun phrases" would penalise the correct antecedent.
For this purpose we have drawn up a compreÂ­ hensive list of all such cases; to our knowledge, no other computational treatment of pronominal anaphora resoluÂ­ tion has addressed the problem of "agreement excepÂ­ tions".

If collocational pattern suggests a tie or does not hold, select the candidate with higher score for indicating verbs.
The resolution of anaphors was carried out with a sucÂ­ cess rate of 95.8%.

The approach being robust (an attempt is made to resolve each anaphor and a proÂ­ posed antecedent is returned), this figure represents both "precision" and "recall" if we use the MUC terminology.

The success rate of the "Baseline Subject" was 29.2%, whereas the success rate of "Baseline Most Recent NP" was 62.5%.
As far as the typical failure cases are concerned, we anticipate the knowledge-poor approach to have difficulties with sentences which have a more comÂ­ plex syntactic structure.

The evaluation carried out was manual to ensure that no added error was genÂ­ erated (e.g. due to possible wrong sentence/clause detection or POS tagging).
The evaluation indicated 83.6% success rate.

A case where the system failed was when the anaphor and the antecedent were in the same senÂ­ tence and where preference was given to a candidate in the preceding sentence.

tive evaluation of Breck Baldwin's CogNIAC We felt appropriate to extend the evaluation of our approach by comparing it to Breck Baldwin's CogÂ­ NIAC (Baldwin 1997) approach which features "high precision coreference with limited knowledge and linguistics resources".

CogNIAC successfully resolved the pronouns in 75% of the cases.
For the training data from the genre of technical manuals, it was rule 5 (see Baldwin 1997) which was most frequently used (39% of the cases, 100% success), followed by rule 8 (33% of the cases, 33% success), rule 7 (11%, 100%), rule I (9%, 100%) and rule 3 (7.4%, 100%).
We used the robust approach as a basis for develÂ­ oping a genre-specific reference resolution approach in Polish.
The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolvÂ­ ing anaphors (with critical success rate of 86.2%).

Our preference-based approach showed clear suÂ­ periority over both baseline models.
Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7% for the genre of techÂ­ nical manuals and at least in this genre, the approach appears to be more successful than other similar methods.
