Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task.
We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.

We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.

For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.
Also, in Information Extraction (IE), in which the system tries to extract elements of some events (e.g. date and company names of a corporate merger event), several event instances from different news articles have to be aligned even if these are expressed differently.
For example, we can easily imagine that the number of paraphrases for âA buys Bâ is enormous and it is not possible to create a comprehensive inventory by hand.
In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.
We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.

As can be seen in the example, the first two phrases have a different order of NE names from the last two, so we can determine that the last two phrases represent a reversed relation.
buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.
One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].
Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].

Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.
The discovered paraphrases can be a big help to reduce human labor and create a more comprehensive pattern set.
Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically.
