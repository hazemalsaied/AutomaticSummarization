Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement.

Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information contributes to most of the performance inprovement from syntactic aspect while additional full parsing information does not contribute much, largely due to the fact that most of relations defined in ACE corpus are within a very short distance.
We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet (Miller 1990) and Name List can be used in the feature-based framework.

Complicated relation extraction tasks may also impose a big challenge to the modeling approach used by Miller et al (2000) which integrates various tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, template element extraction and relation extraction, in a single model.
Compared with Kambhatla (2004), we separately incorporate the base phrase chunking information, which contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect.
Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that our system outperforms Kambhatla (2004) by about 3 F-measure on extracting 24 ACE relation subtypes.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a supervised machine learning technique motivated by the statistical learning theory (Vapnik 1998).
Moreover, we only apply the simple linear kernel, although other kernels can peform better.

In addition, we distinguish the argument order of the two mentions (M1 for the first mention and M2 for the second mention), e.g. M1-Parent- Of-M2 vs. M2-Parent-Of-M1.
For example, in the case where the noun phrase âthe former CEO of McDonaldâ has the head annotation of âCEOâ and the extent annotation of âthe former CEO of McDonaldâ, we only consider âthe former CEOâ in this paper.
This feature concerns about the entity type of both the mentions, which can be PERSON, ORGANIZATION, FACILITY, LOCATION and GeoPolitical Entity or GPE â¢ ET12 combination of mention entity types 4.3 Mention Level.
In this paper, we separate the features of base phrase chunking from those of full parsing.
In this paper, we separate the features of base phrase chunking from those of full parsing.
Here, the base phrase chunks are derived from full parse trees using the Perl script5 written by Sabine Buchholz from Tilburg University and the Collinsâ parser (Collins 1999) is employed for full parsing.
Similar to word features, three categories of phrase heads are considered 1) the phrase heads in between are also classified into three bins the first phrase head in between, the last phrase head in between and other phrase heads in between; 2) the phrase heads before M1 are classified into two bins the first phrase head before and the second phrase head before; 3) the phrase heads after M2 are classified into two bins the first phrase head after and the second phrase head after.
This category of features includes information about the words, part-of-speeches and phrase labels of the words on which the mentions are dependent in the dependency tree derived from the syntactic full parse tree.
Semantic information from various resources, such as WordNet, is used to classify important words into different semantic lists according to their indicating relationships.
This paper uses the ACE corpus provided by LDC to train and evaluate our feature-based relation extraction system.
In this paper, we only model explicit relations because of poor inter-annotator agreement in the annotation of implicit relations and their limited number.

It shows that our system achieves best performance of 63.1%/49.5%/ 55.5 in precision/recall/F-measure when combining diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features.
Table 2 also measures the contributions of different features by gradually increasing the feature set.

Instead of exploring the full parse tree information directly as previous related work, we incorporate the base phrase chunking information performance improvement from syntactic aspect while further incorporation of the parse tree and dependence tree information only slightly improves the performance.
Second, it is well known that full parsing is always prone to long-distance parsing errors although the Collinsâ parser used in our system achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
Besides, we also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance.
The effective incorporation of diverse features enables our system outperform previously best- reported systems on the ACE corpus.
Evaluation on the ACE RDC task shows that our approach of combining various kinds of evidence can scale better to problems, where we have a lot of relation types with a relatively small amount of annotated data.
