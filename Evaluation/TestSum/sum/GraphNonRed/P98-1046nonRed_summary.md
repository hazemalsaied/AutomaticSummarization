It is not clear how much WordNet sunsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes , and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy ( Dorr and Jones , 1996 ) , ( Jones and Onyshkevych , 1997 ) , ( Dorr , 1997 ) . 
Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible ( Jones et al. , 1994 ) , ( Nomura et al. , 1994 ) , ( Saint-Dizier , 1996 ) . 
Of course , some Levin classes , such as braid ( bob , braid , brush , clip , cold cream comb , condition , crimp , crop , curl , etc . ) are clearly not intended to be synonymous , which at least partly explains the lack of overlap beÂ­ tween Levin and WordNet . 
If only one or two verbs were shared between two classes , we assumed this might be due to hoÂ­ mo phony an idiosyncrasy involving individual verbs rather than a systematic relationship inÂ­ voling coherent sets of verbs . 
The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose . 
The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class memberÂ­ ship . 
Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntacÂ­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning preÂ­ serving ( diathesis alternations ) ( Levin , 1993 ) . 
3.1 Using intersection Levin classes to . 
Intersection Levin sets partition these classes according to more coÂ­ coherent subsets of features ( force , forestations separation , in effect highlighting a lattice of semantic features that determine the sense of a verb . 
â¢ Although kick is not listed as a verb of exerting force , it displays all the alternations that define this class . 
isolate semantic components Some of the large Levin classes comprise verbs that exhibit a wide range of possible semantic components , and could be divided into smaller subclasses . 
Although the Levin classes that make up an intersection class may have conflicting alternaÂ­ sons e.g. , verbs of exerting force can take the donative alternation , while carry verbs can not ) , this does not invalidate the semantic regularity of the intersection class . 
Figure 2 : Intersective class formed from Levin carry , pushily and split verbs- verbs in ( ) are not listed by Levin in all the intersecting classes but participate in all the alternations The intersection between the pushily verbs of exerting force , the carry verbs and the split verbs illustrates how the force semantic compoÂ­ net of a verb can also be used to extend its meaning so that one can infer a causation of accompanied motion . 
WordNet is an onÂ­ line lexical database of English that currently contains approximately 120,000 sets of noun , verb , adjective , and adverb synonyms , each repÂ­ resenting a lexical concept . 
Figure 1 : Algorithm for identifying relevant semantic-class intersections We then reclassified the verbs in the database as follows . 
We expect these cross-linguistic features to be useful for capturing translation generalizations between languages as discussed in the literaÂ­ pure Palmer and Rosenzweig , 1996 ) , ( CopesÂ­ take and Sanfilippo , 1993 ) , ( Dorr , 1997 ) . 
intersection class Is such that a verb v E Is iff v E c1 n ... n en , and there is no S ' = { d1 , ..â¢ c } such that S C S ' and v E ci n ... n dm ( subset criterion ) . 
Levin verb classes are based on an underlying latÂ­ tic of partial semantic descriptions , which are manifested indirectly in diathesis alternations . 
It would be straightÂ­ forward to augment it with pointers indicating which senses are basic to a class of verbs and which can be generated automatically , and inÂ­ clue corresponding syntactic information . 
Two current approaches to English verb classiÂ­ fictions are WordNet ( Miller et al. , 1990 ) and Levin classes ( Levin , 1993 ) . 
{ verb of exerting force ; no separation imÂ­ plied , but causation of accompanied motion possible ) 5 . 
However , the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computaÂ­ tonal lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods , although attempts are being made ( Pustejovsky , 1991 ) , ( Copestake and SanÂ­ Filippo 1993 ) , ( Lowe et al. , 1997 ) , ( Dorr , 1997 ) . 
The critical point is that , while the verb 's meaning can be extended to either `` attempted '' action or directed motion , these two extensions can not co-occur - they are mutually exclusive . 
Instead , in their use as split verbs , each verb manifests an extended sense that can be paraphrased as `` separate by V-ing , '' where `` V '' is the basic meaning of that verb ( Levin , 1993 ) . 
TAGs have also been applied to PorÂ­ Portuguese in previous work , resulting in a small Portuguese grammar ( Kipper , 1994 ) . 
Investigating regular sense extensions based on intersective Levin classes
We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes , interÂ­ section Levin classes , as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts . 
Whereas each WordNet sunset is hierarchical ing to only one aspect ( e.g. , Result , in the case of cut ) , Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features , without designating one as primary . 
Most verbs have more than one translation into Portuguese , so we chose the translation that best described the meaning or that had the same type of arguments as described in Levin 's verb classes . 
Whereas high level semantic relations ( synÂ­ onyx hypergamy are represented directly in WordNet , they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes , as with the splitting class . 
Even though the Levin verb classes are defined by their syntactic behavior , many reflect semanÂ­ tic distinctions made by WordNet , a classificaÂ­ son hierarchy defined in terms of purely seÂ­ antic word relations ( synonyms , hypergamy etc . ) . 
( verb of exerting force , no separation or causation of accompanied motion implied ) 3 . 
Given the incompleteness of the list of members of Levin classes , each verb must be examined to see whether it exhibits all the alÂ­ alternation of a class . 
A verb was assigned membership in an intersection class if it was listed in each of the existing classes that were combined to form the new intersection class . 
2.1 Ambiguities in Levin classes . 
The sets of syntactic frames associated with a particular Levin class are not intended to be arbitrary , and they are supposed to reflect unÂ­ underlying semantic components that constrain alÂ­ losable arguments . 
These fringe split verbs appear in several other interÂ­ section classes that highlight the force aspect of their meaning . 
Levin classes are supposed to provide specific sets of syntactic frames that are associated with the individual classes . 
We have presented a refinement of Levin classes , intersection classes , and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses . 
The fact that the split sense for these verbs does not appear explicitly in WordNet is not surprising since it is only an extended sense of the verbs , and separation is inferred only when the verb occurs with an appropriate adjunct , such as apart . 
As can be seen in Table 2 the alternations for the Portuguese translations of the verbs in this intersection class indicate that they share simiÂ­ lar properties with the English verbs , including the causative . 
We have made a preliminary study of the PorÂ­ Portuguese translation of the carry verb class . 
What constitutes a clear sepaÂ­ ration into senses for any one verb , and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished ? 
This filter alÂ­ lowed us to reject the potential intersection classes that would have resulted from combining the reÂ­ move verb with the scribble verb , for example .
