It achieves 52.8 F- measure on the 24 ACE relation subtypes.
Tree kernel-based approaches proposed by Zelenko et al (2003) and Culotta et al (2004) are able to explore the implicit feature space without much feature engineering.
Yet further research work is still expected to make it effective with complicated relation extraction tasks such as the one defined in ACE.

This paper will further explore the feature-based approach with a systematic study on the extensive incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic information.
Moreover, we only apply the simple linear kernel, although other kernels can peform better.
In this paper, we separate the features of base phrase chunking from those of full parsing.
