A search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented.
We are given a source string fJ 1 = f1fj fJ of length J, which is to be translated into a target string eI 1 = e1eieI of length I. Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability ^eI 1 = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1jfJ 1 )g = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1) Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1)g  (1) The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language.

Our approach uses word-to-word dependencies between source and target words.
In Section 4, we present the performance measures used and give translation results on the Verbmobil task.
In this section, we brie y review our translation approach.
For the translation model Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1), we go on the assumption that each source word is aligned to exactly one target word.
