Input is checked against agreement and for a number of antecedent indicators.
However, to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense.
Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).
1We use the simple heuristics that the given information is the first noun phrase in a non-imperative sentence.
This measure (Mitkov 1998b) applies only to anaphors "ambiguous" from the point of view of number and gender (i.e. to those "tough" anaphors which, after activating the gender and number filters, still have more than one candidate for antecedent) and is indicative of the performance of the antecedent indicators.
