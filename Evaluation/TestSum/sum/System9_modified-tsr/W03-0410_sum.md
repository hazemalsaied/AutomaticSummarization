A number of supervised learning approaches have extracted such information about verbs from corpora, including their argument roles (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), selectional preferences (Resnik, 1996), and lexical semantic classification (i.e., grouping verbs according to their argument structure properties) (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Lapata and Brew, 1999; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Joanis and Stevenson, 2003).

Unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches have been successful as well, but have tended to be more restrictive, in relying on human filtering of the results (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998), on the hand- selection of features (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), or on the use of an extensive grammar (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002).
Such classes group together verbs that share both a common semantics (such as transfer of possession or change of state), and a set of syntactic frames for expressing the arguments of the verb (Levin, 1993; FrameNet, 2003).

In this paper, we report results on several feature selection approaches to the problem manual selection (based on linguistic knowledge), unsupervised selection (based on an entropy measure among the features, Dash et al., 1997), and a semi- supervised approach (in which seed verbs are used to train a supervised learner, from which we extract the useful features).
Like others, we have assumed lexical semantic classes of verbs as defined in Levin (1993) (hereafter Levin), which have served as a gold standard in computational linguistics research (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Kipper et al., 2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002).

We used the chunker (partial parser) of Abney (1991) to preprocess the corpus, which (noisily) determines the NP subject and direct object of a verb, as well as the PPs potentially associated with it.

(1997) propose an unsupervised method to rank a set of features according to their ability to organize the data in space, based on an entropy measure they devise.
However, in many aspects of computational linguistics, it has been found that a small amount of labelled data contains sufficient information to allow us to go beyond the limits of completely unsupervised approaches.
