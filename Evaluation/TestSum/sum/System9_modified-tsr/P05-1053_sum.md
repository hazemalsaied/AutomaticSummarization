According to the scope of the NIST Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program, current research in IE has three main objectives Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT), Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC), and Event Detection and Characterization (EDC).

Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information contributes to most of the performance inprovement from syntactic aspect while additional full parsing information does not contribute much, largely due to the fact that most of relations defined in ACE corpus are within a very short distance.

Since a pronominal mention (especially neutral pronoun such as âitâ and âitsâ) contains little information about the sense of the mention, the co- reference chain is used to decide its sense.

Although tree kernel-based approaches facilitate the exploration of the implicit feature space with the parse tree structure, yet the current technologies are expected to be further advanced to be effective for relatively complicated relation extraction tasks such as the one defined in ACE where 5 types and 24 subtypes need to be extracted.
