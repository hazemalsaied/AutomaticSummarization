In particular, our experiment was conducted on comparable corpora that are not very closely related and as such, most of the Chinese words have no translations of times term t occurs in the query Q , n = ât ct is the total number of terms in query Q . For ranking purpose, the first fraction n!
So we estimate that English translations are present in the English part of the corpus for Table 2.

To investigate the effect of the two individual sources of information (context and transliteration), we checked how many translations could be found using only one source of information (i.e., context alone or transliteration alone), on those Chinese words that have translations in the English part of the comparable corpus.

On the other hand, using our method of combining both sources of information and setting M = â, 19 Chinese words (i.e., the first 22 Chinese words in Table 3 except å·´ä½äº,å©å,æ®å©æ³) have their correct English translations at rank one position.
