One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledgeÃÂÃÂ­ based system, however, is that it is a very labourÃÂÃÂ­ intensive and time-consuming task.

For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell & Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria & Stallard 1989; Lappin & McCord 1990; Lappin & Leass 1994; Mitkov 1994; Rich & LuperFoy 1988; Sidner 1979; Webber 1979).

Several proposals have already addressed the anaphora resolution problem by deliberately limiting the extent to which they rely on domain and/or linÃÂÃÂ­ guistic knowledge (Baldwin 1997; Dagan & ltai 1990; Kennedy & Boguraev 1996; Mitkov 1998; Nasukawa 1994; Williams et al. 1996).

Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).

With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semanÃÂÃÂ­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for realÃÂÃÂ­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowlÃÂÃÂ­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.

It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as "antecedent indicators").

Antecedent indicators (preferences) play a decisive role in tracking down the antecedent from a set of possible candidates.
Antecedent indicators (preferences) play a decisive role in tracking down the antecedent from a set of possible candidates.
Candidates are assigned a score (-1, 0, 1 or 2) for each indicator; the candidate with the highest aggregate score is proposed as the anteÃÂÃÂ­ cedent.
Definiteness Definite noun phrases in previous sentences are more likely antecedents of pronominal anaphors than indefinite ones (definite noun phrases score 0 and indefinite ones are penalised by -1).
The new information, or rheme, provides some information about the theme.
Lexically reiterated items include reÃÂÃÂ­ peated synonymous noun phrases which may often be preceded by definite articles or demonstratives.
Immediate reference In technical manuals the "immediate reference" clue can often be useful in identifying the antecedent.
Referential distance In complex sentences, noun phrases in the previous clause2 are the best candidate for the antecedent of an anaphor in the subsequent clause, followed by noun phrases in the previous sentence, then by nouns situated 2 sentences further back and finally nouns 3 sentences further back (2, 1, 0, -1).
As already mentioned, each of the antecedent inÃÂÃÂ­ dicators assigns a score with a value {-1, 0, 1, 2}.
We should point out that the antecedent indicators are preferences and not absolute factors.

For practical reasons, the approach presented does not incorporate syntactic and semantic information (other than a list of domain terms) and it is not realÃÂÃÂ­ istic to expect its performance to be as good as an approach which makes use of syntactic and semantic knowledge in terms of constraints and preferences.

Lack of semantic knowledge rules out the use of verb seÃÂÃÂ­ mantics and semantic parallelism.

In fact, our evaluation shows that the reÃÂÃÂ­ sults are comparable to syntax-based methods (Lappin & Leass I994).

The resolution of anaphors was carried out with a sucÃÂÃÂ­ cess rate of 95.8%.
The success rate of the "Baseline Subject" was 29.2%, whereas the success rate of "Baseline Most Recent NP" was 62.5%.
From this example we can also see that our knowledge-poor approach successfully tackles cases in which the anaphor and theÃÂÃ¡á¹Â antecedent have not only different syntactic functions but also different semantic roles.

As far as the typical failure cases are concerned, we anticipate the knowledge-poor approach to have difficulties with sentences which have a more comÃÂÃÂ­ plex syntactic structure.
3.2 Evaluation B. We carried out a second evaluation of the approach on a different set of sample texts from the genre of technical manuals (47-page Portable Style-Writer User's Guide (Stylewriter 1994).
3.2 Evaluation B. We carried out a second evaluation of the approach on a different set of sample texts from the genre of technical manuals (47-page Portable Style-Writer User's Guide (Stylewriter 1994).
The evaluation carried out was manual to ensure that no added error was genÃÂÃÂ­ erated (e.g. due to possible wrong sentence/clause detection or POS tagging).
Another reason for doing it by hand is to ensure a fair comparison with Breck Baldwin's method, which not being available to us, had to be hand-simulated (see 3.3).
In the second experiment we evaluated the apÃÂÃÂ­ proach from the point of view also of its "critical success rate".
A case where the system failed was when the anaphor and the antecedent were in the same senÃÂÃÂ­ tence and where preference was given to a candidate in the preceding sentence.
tive evaluation of Breck Baldwin's CogNIAC We felt appropriate to extend the evaluation of our approach by comparing it to Breck Baldwin's CogÃÂÃÂ­ NIAC (Baldwin 1997) approach which features "high precision coreference with limited knowledge and linguistics resources".
The reason is that both our approach and Breck Baldwin's approach share common principles (both are knowledge-poor and use a POS tagger to provide the input) and therefore a comparison would be appropriate.
Given that our approach is robust and returns anÃÂÃÂ­ tecedent for each pronoun, in order to make the comparison as fair as possible, we used CogNIAC's "resolve all" version by simulating it manually on the same training data used in evaluation B above.
For the time being, we are using the same scores for Polish.
The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolvÃÂÃÂ­ ing anaphors (with critical success rate of 86.2%).
We have described a robust, knowledge-poor apÃÂÃÂ­ proach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger.
Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7% for the genre of techÃÂÃÂ­ nical manuals and at least in this genre, the approach appears to be more successful than other similar methods.
