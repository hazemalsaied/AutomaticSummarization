Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.

We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.

For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userÃá¸ÃÂÃÂs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userÃá¸ÃÂÃÂs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.
Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.

In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.
We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.

After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue.
We use a simple TF/IDF method to measure the topicality of words.
The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [Sekine et al. 2004].

Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword.
As can be seen in the example, the first two phrases have a different order of NE names from the last two, so we can determine that the last two phrases represent a reversed relation.
In this subsection, we will report the results of the experiment, in terms of the number of words, phrases or clusters.
Here a set is represented by the keyword and the number in parentheses indicates the number of shared NE pair instances.
buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.

The similar explanation applies to the link to the Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂstakeÃá¸ÃÂÃÂ set.
One possibility is to use n-grams based on mutual information.
Using structural information As was explained in the results section, we extracted examples like Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂSmith estimates LotusÃá¸ÃÂÃÂ, from a sentence like Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂMr.
Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically.
