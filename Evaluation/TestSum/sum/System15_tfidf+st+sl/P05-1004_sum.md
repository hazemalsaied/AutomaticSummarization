The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is a significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.
Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001).

In particular, WORDNET (Fellbaum, 1998) has significantly influenced research in NLP.

Lexicographers cannot possibly keep pace with language evolution sense distinctions are continually made and merged, words are coined or become obsolete, and technical terms migrate into the vernacular.
These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or semiautomatic methods for the creation and maintenance of lexical-semantic resources.
Lex-files form a set of coarse-grained sense distinctions within WORDNET.
Supersense tagging is also interesting for many applications that use shallow semantics, e.g. information extraction and question answering.
The other measure they found to be successful was the entropy of the conditional distribution of surrounding words given the noun.

Our approach uses voting across the known supersenses of automatically extracted synonyms, to select a super- sense for the unknown nouns.
