Of course , some Levin classes , such as braid ( bob , braid , brush , clip , cold cream comb , condition , crimp , crop , curl , etc . ) are clearly not intended to be synonymous , which at least partly explains the lack of overlap beÂ­ tween Levin and WordNet . 
If only one or two verbs were shared between two classes , we assumed this might be due to hoÂ­ mo phony an idiosyncrasy involving individual verbs rather than a systematic relationship inÂ­ voling coherent sets of verbs .

Although the Levin classes that make up an intersection class may have conflicting alternaÂ­ sons e.g. , verbs of exerting force can take the donative alternation , while carry verbs can not ) , this does not invalidate the semantic regularity of the intersection class . 
isolate semantic components Some of the large Levin classes comprise verbs that exhibit a wide range of possible semantic components , and could be divided into smaller subclasses .

Figure 2 : Intersective class formed from Levin carry , pushily and split verbs- verbs in ( ) are not listed by Levin in all the intersecting classes but participate in all the alternations The intersection between the pushily verbs of exerting force , the carry verbs and the split verbs illustrates how the force semantic compoÂ­ net of a verb can also be used to extend its meaning so that one can infer a causation of accompanied motion . 
It would be straightÂ­ forward to augment it with pointers indicating which senses are basic to a class of verbs and which can be generated automatically , and inÂ­ clue corresponding syntactic information .

{ verb of exerting force ; no separation imÂ­ plied , but causation of accompanied motion possible ) 5 . 
However , the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computaÂ­ tonal lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods , although attempts are being made ( Pustejovsky , 1991 ) , ( Copestake and SanÂ­ Filippo 1993 ) , ( Lowe et al. , 1997 ) , ( Dorr , 1997 ) . 
The critical point is that , while the verb 's meaning can be extended to either `` attempted '' action or directed motion , these two extensions can not co-occur - they are mutually exclusive .

TAGs have also been applied to PorÂ­ Portuguese in previous work , resulting in a small Portuguese grammar ( Kipper , 1994 ) .

Even though the Levin verb classes are defined by their syntactic behavior , many reflect semanÂ­ tic distinctions made by WordNet , a classificaÂ­ son hierarchy defined in terms of purely seÂ­ antic word relations ( synonyms , hypergamy etc . ) . 
( verb of exerting force , no separation or causation of accompanied motion implied ) 3 . 
Whereas each WordNet sunset is hierarchical ing to only one aspect ( e.g. , Result , in the case of cut ) , Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features , without designating one as primary . 
A verb was assigned membership in an intersection class if it was listed in each of the existing classes that were combined to form the new intersection class .

The fact that the split sense for these verbs does not appear explicitly in WordNet is not surprising since it is only an extended sense of the verbs , and separation is inferred only when the verb occurs with an appropriate adjunct , such as apart . 
Most verbs have more than one translation into Portuguese , so we chose the translation that best described the meaning or that had the same type of arguments as described in Levin 's verb classes .

This filter alÂ­ lowed us to reject the potential intersection classes that would have resulted from combining the reÂ­ move verb with the scribble verb , for example .
