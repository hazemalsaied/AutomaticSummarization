In this paper , we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus .

There has also been work using a bootstrap- ping approach [ Brin 98 ; Agichtein and Gravano 00 ; Ravichandran and Hovy 02 ] . 
Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger , the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kind of cue .

We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities ( NEs ) , as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications . 
Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [ Sekine et al . 2004 ] .

Overview of the method 2.2 Step by Step Algorithm . 
Recently , this topic has been getting more attention , as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004 , driven by the needs of various NLP applications . 
It is not easy to make a clear definition of paraphrase . 
buy - acquire ( 5 ) buy - agree ( 2 ) buy - purchase ( 5 ) buy - acquisition ( 7 ) buy - pay ( 2 ) * buy - buyout ( 3 ) buy - bid ( 2 ) acquire - purchase ( 2 ) acquire - acquisition ( 2 ) acquire - pay ( 2 ) * purchase - acquisition ( 4 ) purchase - stake ( 2 ) * acquisition - stake ( 2 ) * unit - subsidiary ( 2 ) unit - parent ( 5 ) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct .

In order to create an IE system for a new domain , one has to spend a long time to create the knowledge .

There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora .
