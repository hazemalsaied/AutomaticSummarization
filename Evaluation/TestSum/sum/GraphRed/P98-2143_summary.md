In fact , our evaluation shows that the reÂ­ cults are comparable to syntax-based methods ( Lappin & Leass I994 ) . 
Several proposals have already addressed the anaphora resolution problem by deliberately limiting the extent to which they rely on domain Andros linguistic knowledge ( Baldwin 1997 ; Dagan & ital 1990 ; Kennedy & Boguraev 1996 ; Mitkov 1998 ; Nasukawa 1994 ; Williams et al . 1996 ) . 
We have described a robust , knowledge-poor apÂ­ roach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger .

This measure ( Mitkov 1998b applies only to anaphora ambiguous '' from the point of view of number and gender ( i.e . to those `` tough '' anaphora , after activating the gender and number filters , still have more than one candidate for antecedent ) and is indicative of the performance of the antecedent indicators .

Finally , our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English , but also for other languages ( in our case Polish and Arabic ) . 
The approach works as follows : it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger , identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphora within a distance of 2 sentences , checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphora and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÂ­ raining candidates ( see next section ) . 
However , to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense .

For the most part , anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods ( Carbonell & Brown 1988 ; Carter 1987 ; Hobbs 1978 ; Ingria & Stallard 1989 ; Lappin & McCord 1990 ; Lappin & Leass 1994 ; Mitkov 1994 ; Rich & LuperFoy 1988 ; Sidner 1979 ; Webber 1979 ) . 
Givenness Noun phrases in previous sentences representing the `` given information '' ( theme ) 1 are deemed good candidates for antecedents and score I ( candidates not representing the theme score 0 ) .

3.3 Comparison to similar approaches : comparaÂ­ . 
We have recently adapted the approach for AraÂ­ bic as well ( Mitkov & Belguith 1998 ) . 
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the apÂ­ roach and to explore if I how far it is superior over the baseline models for anaphora resolution , we also tested the sample text on ( i ) a Baseline Model which checks agreement in number and gender and , where more than one candidate remains , picks as anteceÂ­ dent the most recent subject matching the gender and number of the anaphora ii ) a Baseline Model which picks as antecedent the most recent noun phrase that matches the gender and number of the anaphora 
It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger , plus simple noun phrase rules ( sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most ) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences ( referred to hereafter as `` antecedent indicators '' ) . 
Look for noun phrases 3 only to the left of the anaphor 4 2 . 
As expected , some of the preferences had to be modified in order to fit with specific features of Polish ( Mitkov & Stys 1997 ) . 
3.1 Evaluation A . Our first evaluation exercise ( Mitkov & Stys 1997 ) was based on a random sample text from a technical manual in English ( Minolta 1994 ) . 
Finally , our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English , but also for other languages ( in our case Polish and Arabic ) . 
It is also an example of how anaphora in a specific genre can be resolved quite successfully without any sophisticated linguistic knowledge or even without parsing .

While various alternatives have been proposed , making use of e.g . neural networks , a situation seÂ­ antics framework , or the principles of reasoning with uncertainty ( e.g . Connoly et al . 1994 ; Mitkov 1995 ; Tin & Akman 1995 ) , there is still a strong need for the development of robust and effective strategies to meet the demands of practical NLP systems , and to enhance further the automatic proÂ­ cussing of growing language resources .

In the following we shall outline some the indicators used and shall illustrate them by exÂ­ ample . 
For the most part , anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods ( Carbonell & Brown 1988 ; Carter 1987 ; Hobbs 1978 ; Ingria & Stallard 1989 ; Lappin & McCord 1990 ; Lappin & Leass 1994 ; Mitkov 1994 ; Rich & LuperFoy 1988 ; Sidner 1979 ; Webber 1979 ) . 
CogNIAC successfully resolved the pronouns in 75 % of the cases .

For practical reasons , the approach presented does not incorporate syntactic and semantic information ( other than a list of domain terms ) and it is not realÂ­ is tic to expect its performance to be as good as an approach which makes use of syntactic and semantic knowledge in terms of constraints and preferences . 
In a coherent text ( Firbas 1992 ) , the given or known information , or theme , usually appears first , and thus forms a coÂ­ referential link with the preceding text .

Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7 % for the genre of techÂ­ finical manuals and at least in this genre , the approach appears to be more successful than other similar methods . 
Similarly to the evaluation for English , we comÂ­ pared the approach for Polish with ( i ) a Baseline Model which discounts candidates on the basis of agreement in number and gender and , if there were still competing candidates , selects as the antecedent the most recent subject matching the anaphora in gender and number ( ii ) a Baseline Model which checks agreement in number and gender and , if there were still more than one candidate left , picks up as the antecedent the most recent noun phrase that agrees with the anaphora . 
The algorithm for pronoun resolution can be deÂ­ scribed informally as follows : 1 . 
Our evaluaÂ­ son based on 63 examples ( anaphora from a techÂ­ finical manual ( Sony 1992 ) , indicates a success rate of 95.2 % ( and critical success rate 89.3 % ) .

The noun phrase with the highest aggregate score is proposed as antecedent ; in the rare event of a tie , priority is given to the candidate with the higher score for imÂ­ mediate reference . 
The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3 % in resolvÂ­ ing anaphora with critical success rate of 86.2 % ) .

We regard a noun phrase as definite if the head noun is modified by a definite article , or by demonstrative or possesÂ­ give pronouns . 
If we regard as `` discriminative power '' of each antecedent indicator the ratio `` number of successful antecedent identifications when this indicator was applied '' / '' number of applications of this indicator '' ( for the non-prepositional noun phrase and definiteÂ­ less being penalizing indicators , this figure is calcuÂ­ lated as the ratio `` number of unsuccessful anteceÂ­ dent identifications '' / '' number of applications '' ) , the immediate reference emerges as the most discrimiÂ­ native indicator ( 100 % ) , followed by nonÂ­ prepositional noun phrase ( 92.2 % ) , collocation ( 90.9 % ) , section heading ( 61.9 % ) , lexical reiteration ( 58.5 % ) , givenness ( 49.3 % ) , term preference ( 35.7 % ) and referential distance ( 34.4 % ) .

The reason is that both our approach and Breck Baldwin 's approach share common principles ( both are knowledge-poor and use a POS tagger to provide the input ) and therefore a comparison would be appropriate . 
For the most part , anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods ( Carbonell & Brown 1988 ; Carter 1987 ; Hobbs 1978 ; Ingria & Stallard 1989 ; Lappin & McCord 1990 ; Lappin & Leass 1994 ; Mitkov 1994 ; Rich & LuperFoy 1988 ; Sidner 1979 ; Webber 1979 ) .

ital candidate and assign scores ; the candidate with the highest aggregate score is proposed as 3A sentence splitter would already have segmented the text into sentences , a POS tagger would already have determined the parts of speech and a simple phrasal grammar would already have detected the noun phrases 4In this project we do not treat anaphora non-anaphoric `` it '' occurring in constructions such as `` It is important '' , `` It is necessary '' is eliminated by a `` referential filter '' 5Note that this restriction may not always apply in lanÂ­ gages other than English ( e.g . German ) ; on the other hand , there are certain collective nouns in English which do not agree in number with their antecedents ( e.g . `` government '' , `` team '' , `` parliament '' etc . can be referred to by `` they '' ; equally some plural nouns ( e.g . `` data '' ) can be referred to by `` it '' ) and are exempted from the agreeÂ­ met test .

3.1 Evaluation A . Our first evaluation exercise ( Mitkov & Stys 1997 ) was based on a random sample text from a technical manual in English ( Minolta 1994 ) . 
The lack of syntactic information , for instance , means giving up c-cornmand constraints and subject preference ( or on other occasions object preference , see Mitkov I995 ) which could be used in center tracking . 
This rule is ignored if there are no definite articles , possessive or demonstrative proÂ­ nouns in the paragraph ( this exception is taken into account because some English user 's guides tend to omit articles ) . 
It is also an example of how anaphora in a specific genre can be resolved quite successfully without any sophisticated linguistic knowledge or even without parsing .
