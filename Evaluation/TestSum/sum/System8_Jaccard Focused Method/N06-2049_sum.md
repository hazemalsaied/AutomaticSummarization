We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.
The character-based âIOBâ tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).
We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.
In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.
In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (CRF) for the IOB tagging, yielded very high R-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.

In the third step, we used the CRFs approach to train the IOB tagger (Lafferty et al., 2001) on the training data.
We defined a cutoff value for each feature type and selected the features with occurrence counts over the cutoff.
Since this work was to evaluate the proposed subword-based IOB tagging, we carried out the closed test only.
using the FMM, and then labeled with âIOBâ tags by the CRFs.
