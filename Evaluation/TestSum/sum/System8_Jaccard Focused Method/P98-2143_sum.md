Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent.
Evaluation reports a success rate of 89.7% which is better than the sucÂ­ cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data.
For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell & Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria & Stallard 1989; Lappin & McCord 1990; Lappin & Leass 1994; Mitkov 1994; Rich & LuperFoy 1988; Sidner 1979; Webber 1979).

However, to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense.
While various alternatives have been proposed, making use of e.g. neural networks, a situation seÂ­ mantics framework, or the principles of reasoning with uncertainty (e.g. Connoly et al. 1994; Mitkov 1995; Tin & Akman 1995), there is still a strong need for the development of robust and effective strategies to meet the demands of practical NLP systems, and to enhance further the automatic proÂ­ cessing of growing language resources.

It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as "antecedent indicators").
The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÂ­ maining candidates (see next section).

The algorithm for pronoun resolution can be deÂ­ scribed informally as follows 1.
For practical reasons, the approach presented does not incorporate syntactic and semantic information (other than a list of domain terms) and it is not realÂ­ istic to expect its performance to be as good as an approach which makes use of syntactic and semantic knowledge in terms of constraints and preferences.
The lack of syntactic information, for instance, means giving up c-cornmand constraints and subject preference (or on other occasions object preference, see Mitkov I995) which could be used in center tracking.

In particular, this strategy can often override incorrect decisions linked with strong centering preference (Mitkov & Belguith I998) or syntactic and semantic parallelism preferÂ­ ences (see below).
3.1 Evaluation A. Our first evaluation exercise (Mitkov & Stys 1997) was based on a random sample text from a technical manual in English (Minolta 1994).
3.1 Evaluation A. Our first evaluation exercise (Mitkov & Stys 1997) was based on a random sample text from a technical manual in English (Minolta 1994).
The success rate of the "Baseline Subject" was 29.2%, whereas the success rate of "Baseline Most Recent NP" was 62.5%.
From this example we can also see that our knowledge-poor approach successfully tackles cases in which the anaphor and theÂ· antecedent have not only different syntactic functions but also different semantic roles.
Our robust approach does not use these because it has no information about the syntactic structure of the sentence or about the synÂ­ tactic function/semantic role of each individual word.
The evaluation carried out was manual to ensure that no added error was genÂ­ erated (e.g. due to possible wrong sentence/clause detection or POS tagging).
This measure (Mitkov 1998b) applies only to anaphors "ambiguous" from the point of view of number and gender (i.e. to those "tough" anaphors which, after activating the gender and number filters, still have more than one candidate for antecedent) and is indicative of the performance of the antecedent indicators.

A case where the system failed was when the anaphor and the antecedent were in the same senÂ­ tence and where preference was given to a candidate in the preceding sentence.

The relaÂ­ tively low figures for the majority of indicators should not be regarded as a surprise firstly, we should bear in mind that in most cases a candidate was picked (or rejected) as an antecedent on the baÂ­ sis of applying a number of different indicators and secondly, that most anaphors had a relatively high number of candidates for antecedent.

The reason is that both our approach and Breck Baldwin's approach share common principles (both are knowledge-poor and use a POS tagger to provide the input) and therefore a comparison would be appropriate.

Given that our approach is robust and returns anÂ­ tecedent for each pronoun, in order to make the comparison as fair as possible, we used CogNIAC's "resolve all" version by simulating it manually on the same training data used in evaluation B above.

For the training data from the genre of technical manuals, it was rule 5 (see Baldwin 1997) which was most frequently used (39% of the cases, 100% success), followed by rule 8 (33% of the cases, 33% success), rule 7 (11%, 100%), rule I (9%, 100%) and rule 3 (7.4%, 100%).

While we acknowledge that most of the monolingual NLP approaches are not automatically transferable (with the same degree of efficiency) to other languages, it would be highly desirable if this could be done with minimal adaptaÂ­ tion.
We used the robust approach as a basis for develÂ­ oping a genre-specific reference resolution approach in Polish.
