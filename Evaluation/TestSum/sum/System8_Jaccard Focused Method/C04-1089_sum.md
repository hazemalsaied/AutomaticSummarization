In this paper, we present a new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information.
Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).
Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).
But parallel corpora are scarce resources, especially for uncommon lan guage pairs.
Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations, although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora.
Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).

For example, the work of (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002a; AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation.
On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.
â t c t ! t The candidate ei that is ranked the highest according to the average rank is taken to be the cor where t is a term in the corpus, ct is the number rect translation and is output.
For example, the work of (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002a; AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used only the pronunciation or spelling of w in translation.
On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used only the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.
They attempted to improve named entity translation by combining phonetic and semantic information.
