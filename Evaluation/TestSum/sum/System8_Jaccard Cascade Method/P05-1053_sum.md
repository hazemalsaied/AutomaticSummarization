Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement.
This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking.
We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance.
In ACE vocabulary, entities are objects, mentions are references to them, and relations are semantic relationships between entities.

Complicated relation extraction tasks may also impose a big challenge to the modeling approach used by Miller et al (2000) which integrates various tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, template element extraction and relation extraction, in a single model.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a supervised machine learning technique motivated by the statistical learning theory (Vapnik 1998).

In addition, we distinguish the argument order of the two mentions (M1 for the first mention and M2 for the second mention), e.g. M1-Parent- Of-M2 vs. M2-Parent-Of-M1.
For each pair of mentions3, we compute various lexical, syntactic and semantic features.

For example, in the case where the noun phrase âthe former CEO of McDonaldâ has the head annotation of âCEOâ and the extent annotation of âthe former CEO of McDonaldâ, we only consider âthe former CEOâ in this paper.
4.5 Base Phrase Chunking.
In this paper, we separate the features of base phrase chunking from those of full parsing.
Similar to word features, three categories of phrase heads are considered 1) the phrase heads in between are also classified into three bins the first phrase head in between, the last phrase head in between and other phrase heads in between; 2) the phrase heads before M1 are classified into two bins the first phrase head before and the second phrase head before; 3) the phrase heads after M2 are classified into two bins the first phrase head after and the second phrase head after.
The dependency tree is built by using the phrase head information returned by the Collinsâ parser and linking all the other fragments in a phrase to its head.

This category of features concerns about the information inherent only in the full parse tree.
Semantic information from various resources, such as WordNet, is used to classify important words into different semantic lists according to their indicating relationships.

Second, it is well known that full parsing is always prone to long-distance parsing errors although the Collinsâ parser used in our system achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
Besides, we also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance.
