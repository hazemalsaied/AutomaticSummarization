Technical domains, such as medicine, require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings, and a significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary.
Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only a very small degree of overlap.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every 8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNETâs hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call the noun lex-file classes supersenses.
There are 11 unique beginners in the WORDNET noun hierarchy which could also be used as supersenses.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.
Widdows (2003) uses a similar technique to insert words into the WORDNET hierarchy.

Our implementation of SEXTANT uses a maximum entropy POS tagger designed to be very efficient, tagging at around 100 000 words per second (Curran and Clark, 2003), trained on the entire Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994).
