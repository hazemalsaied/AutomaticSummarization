We see verb classes as the key to making genÂ­ eralizations about regular extensions of meanÂ­ ing.
We also have begun to exÂ­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties.
However, the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computaÂ­ tional lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods, although attempts are being made (Pustejovsky, 1991), (Copestake and SanÂ­ filippo, 1993), (Lowe et al., 1997), (Dorr, 1997).

We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.

Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996).

Two current approaches to English verb classiÂ­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).

Antonymy or semantic opposition links individual words, while the super-/subordinate relation links entire synsets.
Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntacÂ­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning preÂ­ serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).
The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class memberÂ­ ship.

Where break is concerned, the only thing speciÂ­ fied is the resulting change of state where the object becomes separated into pieces.
intersective class Is such that a verb v E Is iff v E c1 n ... n en, and there is no S' = {d1, ..â¢ ,c} such that S C S' and v E ci n ... n dm (subset criterion).
A verb was assigned membership in an intersective class if it was listed in each of the existing classes that were combined to form the new intersective class.

Whereas high level semantic relations (synÂ­ onym, hypernym) are represented directly in WordNet, they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes, as with the cut/split class.
However, apart can also be used with other classes of verbs, including many verbs of motion.
Some manner of motion verbs allow a transitive alternation in addition to the basic inÂ­ transitive.
These verbs are listed in the intersective classes with meander verbs of existence.
We expect these cross-linguistic features to be useful for capturing translation generalizations between languages as discussed in the literaÂ­ ture (Palmer and Rosenzweig, 1996), (CopesÂ­ take and Sanfilippo, 1993), (Dorr, 1997).
In pursuing this goal, we are currently implementÂ­ ing features for motion verbs in the English Tree-Adjoining Grammar, TAG (Bleam et al., 1998).
