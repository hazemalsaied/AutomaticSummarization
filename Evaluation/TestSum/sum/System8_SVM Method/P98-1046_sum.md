In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.
Current approaches to English classificaÂ­ tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limitaÂ­ tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes.
We present a refinement of Levin classes, intersecÂ­ tive sets, which are a more fine-grained clasÂ­ sification and have more coherent sets of synÂ­ tactic frames and associated semantic compoÂ­ nents.

However, the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computaÂ­ tional lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods, although attempts are being made (Pustejovsky, 1991), (Copestake and SanÂ­ filippo, 1993), (Lowe et al., 1997), (Dorr, 1997).

For inÂ­ stance, carry verbs are described as not taking the conative, *The mother carried at the baby, and yet many of the verbs in the carry class {push, pull, tug, shove, kick) are also listed in the push/pull class, which does take the conaÂ­ tive.

As a verb of exerting force, push can appear in the conative alternaÂ­ tion, which emphasizes its force semantic comÂ­ ponent and ability to express an "attempted" action where any result that might be associÂ­ ated- with the verb (e.g., motion) is not necÂ­ essarily achieved; as a carry verb (used with a goal or directional phrase), push cannot take the conative alternation, which would conflict with the core meaning of the carry verb class (i.e., causation of motion).
Verbs in the slide/roll/run intersecÂ­ tion are also allowed to appear in the dative alternation (Carla slid the book to Dale, Carla slid Dale the book), in which the sense of change of location is extended to change of possession.When used intransitively with a path prepo sitional phrase, some of the manner of motion verbs can take on a sense of pseudo-motional existence, in which the subject does not actuÂ­ ally move, but has a shape that could describe a path for the verb (e.g., The stream twists through the valley).
