Starting from a DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem, we present a novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language in order to achieve an eÃcient search algorithm.
The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task (GermanEnglish, 8000-word vocabulary), which is a limited-domain spoken-language task.
We are given a source string fJ 1 = f1fj fJ of length J, which is to be translated into a target string eI 1 = e1eieI of length I. Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability ^eI 1 = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1jfJ 1 )g = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1) Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1)g  (1) The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language.

What is important and is not expressed by the notation is the so-called coverage constraint each source position j should be 'hit' exactly once by the path of the inverted alignment bI 1 = b1bibI . Using the inverted alignments in the maximum approximation, we obtain as search criterion max I (p(JjI) max eI 1 ( I Yi=1 p(eijeiô1 iô2) max bI 1 I Yi=1 [p(bijbiô1; I; J) p(fbi jei)])) = = max I (p(JjI) max eI 1;bI 1 ( I Yi=1 p(eijeiô1 iô2) p(bijbiô1; I; J) p(fbi jei)])); where the two products over i have been merged into a single product over i. p(eijeiô1 iô2) is the trigram language model probability.
