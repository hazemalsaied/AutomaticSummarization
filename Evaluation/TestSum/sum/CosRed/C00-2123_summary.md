Word Re-ordering and DP-based Search in Statistical Machine Translation
We are given a source string fJ 1 = f1 : : : fj : : : fJ of length J , which is to be translated into a target string eI 1 = e1 : : : ei : : : eI of length I . Among all possible target strings , we will choose the string with the highest probability : ^eI 1 = arg max eI 1 fPr ( eI 1jfJ 1 ) g = arg max eI 1 fPr ( eI 1 ) Pr ( fJ 1 jeI 1 ) g : ( 1 ) The argyle operation denotes the search problem , i.e . the generation of the output sentence in the target language . 
On average , 6 reference translations per automatic translation are available . 
The computing time is given in terms of CPU time per sentence ( on a 450MHz PentiumIIIPC ) . 
For each source word f , the list of its possible translations e is sorted according to p ( fje ) pun e ) , where pun e ) is the trigram probability of the English word e. It is suÃcient to consider only the best 50 words . 
The sentence length probability p ( JjI ) is omitted without any loss in performance . 
The sentence length probability p ( JjI ) is omitted without any loss in performance . 
On average , 6 reference translations per automatic translation are available . 
We show translation results for three approaches : the monotone search ( MonS ) , where no word reordering is allowed ( Tillmann , 1997 ) , the monotone search ( QmS ) as presented in this paper and the IBM style ( IbmS ) search as described in Section 3.2 .

The word joining is done on the basis of a likelihood criterion . 
A procedural definition to restrict1In the approach described in ( Berger et al. , 1996 ) , a mor pathological analysis is carried out and word morphemes rather than full-form words are used during the search . 
For a trigram language model , the partial hypotheses are of the form ( e0 ; e ; C ; j ) .

An extended lexicon model is defined , and its likelihood is compared to a baseline lexicon model , which takes only single-word dependencies into account .
