In addition , we found a clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach : It yields a very low in-vocabulary ( IV ) rate ( R-iv ) in return for a higher out-of-vocabulary ( OOV ) rate ( R-oov ) . 
The effect of the confidence measure is shown in Table 3 , where we used Î± = 0.7 and confidence threshold t = 0.8 . 
We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation.

0 means the current word ; â1 â2 the first or second word to the left ; 1 , 2 , the first or second word to the right . 
Since it was a closed test , some information such as Arabic and Chinese number and alphabetical letters can not be used . 
It is composed of three parts : a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words , a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs , and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging . 
Detailed descriptions about sub word tagging by CRF can be found in our paper ( Zhang et al. , 2006 ) .

For the subword-based tagging , we added another 2000 most frequent multiple- character words to the lexicons for tagging . 
In this work , we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation .
