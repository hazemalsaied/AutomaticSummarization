After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger , the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue .

As a later reï¬nement , Sekine ( 2005 ) makes a similar attempt at using distributional similarity over named entity pairs in order to produce a list of fully lexical phrasal paraphrases for specific concepts represented by keywords . 
Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
In this paper , we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus .

However , those methods need initial seeds , so the relation between entities has to be known in advance .

We agree with Sekine ( 2005 ) who claims that several different methods are required to discover a wider variety of paraphrases .

Here , the term frequency ( TF ) is the frequency of a word in the bag and the inverse term frequency ( ITF ) is the inverse of the log of the frequency in the entire corpus .

For examples , in Figure 3 , we can see that the phrase in the âbuyâ acquire and purchase sets are mostly Paraphrase .
