Investigating regular sense extensions based on intersective Levin classes
This is an obvious shortcoming of the current implementation of intersecÂ­ tie classes , and might affect the choice of 3 as a relevance cutoff in later implementations . 
WordNet is an onÂ­ line lexical database of English that currently contains approximately 120,000 sets of noun , verb , adjective , and adverb synonyms , each repÂ­ resenting a lexical concept . 
The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose .

Most verbs have more than one translation into Portuguese , so we chose the translation that best described the meaning or that had the same type of arguments as described in Levin 's verb classes .

Instead , in their use as split verbs , each verb manifests an extended sense that can be paraphrased as `` separate by V-ing , '' where `` V '' is the basic meaning of that verb ( Levin , 1993 ) . 
isolate semantic components Some of the large Levin classes comprise verbs that exhibit a wide range of possible semantic components , and could be divided into smaller subclasses . 
We think that many cases of ambiguÃÂ­ ous classification of the lexical entry for a verb can be addressed with the notion of intersection sets introduced by Dang et al .

Investigating regular sense extensions based on intersective Levin classes
The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class memberÂ­ ship . 
LevinÃ¢â¬â¢s ( 1993 ) seminal study on diathesis alternations and verb semantic classes has recently influenced work in dictionary creation ( Dorr 1997 ; Dang et al . 1998 ; Dorr and Jones 1996 ) 
This distinction appears in the second-order Levin classes as membership vs. nonmemberÂ­ ship in the intersection class with split .

Investigating regular sense extensions based on intersective Levin classes
The fact that the split sense for these verbs does not appear explicitly in WordNet is not surprising since it is only an extended sense of the verbs , and separation is inferred only when the verb occurs with an appropriate adjunct , such as apart .

Investigating regular sense extensions based on intersective Levin classes
Of course , some Levin classes , such as braid ( bob , braid , brush , clip , cold cream comb , condition , crimp , crop , curl , etc . ) are clearly not intended to be synonymous , which at least partly explains the lack of overlap beÂ­ tween Levin and WordNet .

Investigating regular sense extensions based on intersective Levin classes
Whereas high level semantic relations ( synÂ­ onyx hypergamy are represented directly in WordNet , they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes , as with the splitting class . 
However , it would be useful for the WordNet senses to have access to the detailed syntactic information that the Levin classes contain , and it would be equally useful to have more guidance as to when membership in a Levin class does in fact indicate shared semanÂ­ tic components .

In this paper we specifically address questions of polygamy with respect to verbs , and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunct of particular syntactic phrases .
