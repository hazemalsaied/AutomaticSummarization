Superdense tagging is also interesting for many applications that use shallow semantics , e.g . information extraction and question answering . 
Our evaluation will use exactly the same test sets as Ciaramita and Johnson ( 2003 ) . 
Carmita and Johnson ( 2003 ) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every 8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus . 
An additional potential is to integrate automatically acquired relationships with the information found in WordNet , which seems to suffer from several serious limitations ( Curran 2005 ) , and typically overlaps to a rather limited extent with the output of automatic acquisition methods . 
Technical domains , such as medicine , require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings , and a significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary . 
This technique is similar to Hearst and SchuÂ¨ tze ( 1993 ) and Widdows ( 2003 ) . 
However , sometimes the unknown noun does not appear in our 2 billion word corpus , or at least does not appear frequently enough to provide sufficient contextual information to extract reliable synonyms . 
Superdense tagging assigns unknown nouns one of 26 broad semantic categories used by lexicographers to organize their manual insertion into WORDNET .
