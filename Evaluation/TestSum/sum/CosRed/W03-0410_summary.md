Because we make the simplifying assumption of a single correct classification for each verb , we also removed any verb : that was deemed excessively polygamous that belonged to another class under consideration in our study ; or for which the class did not correspond to the main sense . 
A number of supervised learning approaches have extracted such information about verbs from corpora , including their argument roles ( Gildea and Jurafsky , 2002 ) , selectional preferences ( Resnik , 1996 ) , and lexical semantic classification ( i.e. , grouping verbs according to their argument structure properties ) ( Dorr and Jones , 1996 ; Lapata and Brew , 1999 ; Merlo and Stevenson , 2001 ; Joanis and Stevenson , 2003 ) .

4.1 Clustering Parameters . 
All experiments reported here were run on this same final set of 20 verbs per class ( including a replication of our earlier supervised experiments ) .

We have previously shown that a broad set of 220 noisy features performs well in supervised verb classification ( Joanis and Stevenson , 2003 ) . 
Here we briefly describe the features that comprise our feature space , and refer the interested reader to Joanis and Stevenson ( 2003 ) for details .

We then describe our clustering methodology , the measures we use to evaluate a clustering , and our experimental results .

For example , the accuracy measure ( Stevenson and Joanis 2003 ; Korhonen , Krymolowski , and Marx 2003 ) evaluates whether a verb is assigned to a correct cluster with respect to the gold standard class of the majority of cluster members .

We use , the mean of the silhouette measure from Matlab , which measures how distant a data point is from other clusters . 
Because we make the simplifying assumption of a single correct classification for each verb , we also removed any verb : that was deemed excessively polygamous that belonged to another class under consideration in our study ; or for which the class did not correspond to the main sense . 
We focus here on extending the applicability of unsupervised methods , as in ( Schulte im Walde and Brew , 2002 ; Stevenson and Merlo , 1999 ) , to the lexical semantic classification of verbs . 
Here we briefly describe the features that comprise our feature space , and refer the interested reader to Joanis and Stevenson ( 2003 ) for details . 
Our second measure , the adjusted Rand measure used by Schulte im Walde ( 2003 ) , instead gives a measure of how consistent the given clustering is overall with respect to the gold standard classification . 
However , a general feature space means that most features will be irrelevant to any given verb discrimination task . 
Unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches have been successful as well , but have tended to be more restrictive , in relying on human filtering of the results ( Riloff and Schmelzenbach , 1998 ) , on the hand- selection of features ( Stevenson and Merlo , 1999 ) , or on the use of an extensive grammar ( Schulte im Walde and Brew , 2002 ) .

However , it gives important information about the quality of a clustering : The other measures being equal , a clustering with a higher value indicates tighter and more separated clusters , suggesting stronger inherent patterns in the data .
