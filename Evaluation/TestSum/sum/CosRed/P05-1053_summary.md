The relation extraction task was formulated at the 7th Message Understanding Conference ( MUC7 1998 ) and is starting to be addressed more and more within the natural language processing and machine learning communities . 
This category of features concerns about the information inherent only in the full parse tree . 
This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking.
Helenka et al ( 2003 ) proposed extracting relations by computing kernel functions between parse trees .

Chang 2004 ) approached relation classification by combining various lexical and syntactic features with bootstrapping on top of Support Vector Machines . 
This may be due to the fact that most of relations in the ACE corpus are quite local . 
Miller et al ( 2000 ) augmented syntactic full parse trees with semantic information corresponding to entities and relations , and built generative models for the augmented trees .

While short-distance relations dominate and can be resolved by simple features such as word and chunking features , the further dependency tree and parse tree features can only take effect in the remaining much less and more difficult long-distance relations .
