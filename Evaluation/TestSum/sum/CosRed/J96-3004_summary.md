Lexical-knowledge-based approaches that include statistical information generally presume that one starts with all possible segmentations of a sentence , and picks the best segmentation from the set of possible segmentations using a probabilistic or costÂ­ based scoring mechanism .

Indeed , as we shall show in Section 5 , even human judges differ when presented with the task of segmenting a text into words , so a definition of the criteria used to determine that a given segmentation is correct is crucial before one can interpret such measures .

A Brief Introduction to the Chinese Writing System Most readers will undoubtedly be at least somewhat familiar with the nature of the Chinese writing system , but there are enough common misunderstandings that it is as well to spend a few paragraphs on properties of the Chinese script that will be relevant to topics discussed in this paper . 
16 As one reviewer points out , one problem with the epigram model chosen here is that there is still a. tendency to pick a segmentation containing fewer words . 
Furthermore , even the size of the dictionary per se is less important than the appropriateness of the lexicon to a particular test corpus : as Fung and Wu ( 1994 ) have shown , one can obtain substantially better segmentation by tailoring the lexicon to the corpus to be segmented . 
It has been shown for English ( Wang and Hirschberg 1992 ; Hirschberg 1993 ; Sproat 1994 , inter aria that grammatical part of speech provides useful information for these tasks . 
There is a sizable literature on Chinese word segmentation : recent reviews include Wang , Su , and Mo ( 1990 ) and Wu and Tseng ( 1993 ) .

We will evaluate various specific aspects of the segmentation , as well as the overall segmentation perÂ­ performance .

The family name set is restricted : there are a few hundred single-hanzi family names , and about ten double-hanzi ones . 
Lexical-knowledge-based approaches that include statistical information generally presume that one starts with all possible segmentations of a sentence , and picks the best segmentation from the set of possible segmentations using a probabilistic or costÂ­ based scoring mechanism . 
Methods that allow multiple segmentations must provide criteria for choosing the best segmentation .

For eight judges , ranging k between 1 and 8 corresponded to a precision score range of 90 % to 30 % , meaning that there were relatively few words ( 30 % of those found by the automatic segmented on which all judges agreed , whereas most of the words found by the segmented such that one human judge agreed .

In this paper we present a stochastic finite-state model wherein the basic workhorse is the weighted finite-state transducer .

The average agreement among the human judges is .76 , and the average agreement between ST and the humans is .75 , or about 99 % of the inter human One can better visualize the precision-recall similarity matrix by producing from that matrix a distance matrix , computing a classical metric multidimensional scaling ( Torgerson 1958 ; Becker , Chambers , Wilks 1988 ) on that disÂ­ stance matrix , and plotting the first two most significant dimensions .

The simplest approach involves scoring the various analyses by costs based on word frequency , and picking the lowest cost path ; variants of this approach have been described in Chang , Chen , and Chen ( 1991 ) and Chang and Chen ( 1993 ) . 
In Chinese text , individual characters of the script , to which we shall refer by their traditional name of Hanni Z are written one after another with no intervening spaces ; a Chinese sentence is shown in Figure 1.3 Partly as a result of this , the notion `` word '' has never played a role in Chinese philological tradition , and the idea that Chinese lacks anyÂ­ thing analogous to words in European languages has been prevalent among Western monologists see DeFrancis ( 1984 ) . 
The three solemnization definitions in this section are essentially descriptive restatements of the corresponding constructive solemnization procedures , which in turn are realizaÃÂ­ sons of the widely followed principle of maximum tokenization ( e.g. , Liu 1986 ; Liang 1986a , 1986b ; Wang 1989 ; Jie 1989 ; Wang , Su , and Mo 1990 ; Jie , Liu , and Liang 1991a , b ; Yeh and Lee 1991 ; Webster and Kit 1992 ; Chen and Liu 1992 ; Guo 1993 ; Wu and Su 1993 ; Nie , Jin , and Hannan 1994 ; Sproat et al . 1996 ;

This is in general very difficult , given the extremely free manner in which Chinese given names are formed , and given that in these cases we lack even a family name to give the model confidence that it is identifying a name . 
The major problem for all segmentation systems remains the coverage afforded by the dictionary and the lexical rules used to augment the dictionary to deal with unseen words .

The method just described segments dictionary words , but as noted in Section 1 , there are several classes of words that should be handled that are not found in a standard dictionary . 
This is in general very difficult , given the extremely free manner in which Chinese given names are formed , and given that in these cases we lack even a family name to give the model confidence that it is identifying a name .

While the semantic aspect of radicals is by no means completely predictive , the semantic homogeneity of many classes is quite striking : for example 254 out of the 263 examples ( 97 % ) of the INSECT class listed by Wieger ( 1965 , 77376 ) denote crawling or invertebrate animals ; similarly 21 out of the 22 examples ( 95 % ) of the GHOST class ( page 808 ) denote ghosts or spirits .

This larger corpus was kindly provided to us by United Informatics Inc. , R.O.C . a set of initial estimates of the word frequencies. 9 In this re-estimation procedure only the entries in the base dictionary were used : in other words , derived words not in the base dictionary and personal and foreign names were not used .

orthographic words are thus only a starting point for further analysis and can only be regarded as a useful hint at the desired division of the sentence into words .
