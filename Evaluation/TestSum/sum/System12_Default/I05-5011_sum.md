For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userÃ¢â¬â¢s query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userÃ¢â¬â¢s question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.
Here, an NE instance pair is any pair of NEs separated by at most 4 syntactic chunks; for example, Ã¢â¬ÅIBM plans to acquire LotusÃ¢â¬?.
The data is sorted based on the frequency of the context (Ã¢â¬Åa unit ofÃ¢â¬? appeared 314 times in the corpus) and the NE pair instances appearing with that context are shown with their frequency (e.g. Ã¢â¬ÅNBCÃ¢â¬? and Ã¢â¬ÅGeneral Electric Co.Ã¢â¬? appeared 10 times with the context Ã¢â¬Åa unit ofÃ¢â¬?).

Step 3.
We then gather all phrases with the same keyword.
x EG, has agreed to be bought by H x EG, now owned by H x H to acquire EG x HÃ¢â¬â¢s agreement to buy EG Three of those phrases are actually paraphrases, but sometime there could be some noise; such as the second phrase above.

For example, in the CC-domain, 96 keywords are found which have TF/ITF scores above a threshold; some of them are shown in Figure 3.
Eight out of the thirteen errors in the high frequency phrases in the CC-domain are the phrases in Ã¢â¬ÅagreeÃ¢â¬?.
For example, from the sentence Ã¢â¬ÅMr.
The similar explanation applies to the link to the Ã¢â¬ÅstakeÃ¢â¬? set.
Instead, we focused on phrases and set the frequency threshold to 2, and so were able to utilize a lot of phrases while minimizing noise.
One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].
Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].

There has also been work using a bootstrap- ping approach [Brin 98; Agichtein and Gravano 00; Ravichandran and Hovy 02].

One possibility is to use n-grams based on mutual information.
Also, Ã¢â¬ÅagreeÃ¢â¬? in the CC-domain is not a desirable keyword.
Ã¢â¬ÅAgreeÃ¢â¬? is a subject control verb, which dominates another verb whose subject is the same as that of Ã¢â¬ÅagreeÃ¢â¬?; the latter verb is generally the one of interest for extraction.
Using structural information As was explained in the results section, we extracted examples like Ã¢â¬ÅSmith estimates LotusÃ¢â¬?, from a sentence like Ã¢â¬ÅMr.
Using structural information As was explained in the results section, we extracted examples like Ã¢â¬ÅSmith estimates LotusÃ¢â¬?, from a sentence like Ã¢â¬ÅMr.
Smith estimates Lotus will make profit this quarterÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬?.
Smith estimates Lotus will make profit this quarterÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬?.
In order to solve this problem, a parse tree is needed to understand that Ã¢â¬ÅLotusÃ¢â¬? is not the object of Ã¢â¬ÅestimatesÃ¢â¬?.
The phrases have to be the expressions of length less than 5 chunks, appear between two NEs.
Also, the method of using keywords rules out phrases which donÃ¢â¬â¢t contain popular words in the domain.
Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.
The discovered paraphrases can be a big help to reduce human labor and create a more comprehensive pattern set.
We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.
