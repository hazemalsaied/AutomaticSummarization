However, to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense.
Our work is a continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaphÃÂ­ ora resolution.

Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).

With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semanÃÂ­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for realÃÂ­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowlÃÂ­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.

The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÃÂ­ maining candidates (see next section).
The noun phrase with the highest aggregate score is proposed as antecedent; in the rare event of a tie, priority is given to the candidate with the higher score for imÃÂ­ mediate reference.

If this does not help, the candidate with the higher score for indicating verbs is preferred.

If still no choice is possible, the most recent from the remaining candiÃÂ­ dates is selected as the antecedent.
2.1 Antecedent indicators.
2.1 Antecedent indicators.
The antecedent indicators have been identiÃÂ­ fied empirically and are related to salience (definiteness, givenness, indicating verbs, lexical reiteration, section heading preference, "nonÃÂ­ prepositional" noun phrases), to structural matches (collocation, immediate reference), to referential distance or to preference of terms.

Definiteness Definite noun phrases in previous sentences are more likely antecedents of pronominal anaphors than indefinite ones (definite noun phrases score 0 and indefinite ones are penalised by -1).

We regard a noun phrase as definite if the head noun is modified by a definite article, or by demonstrative or possesÃÂ­ sive pronouns.
In a coherent text (Firbas 1992), the given or known information, or theme, usually appears first, and thus forms a coÃÂ­ referential link with the preceding text.
The new information, or rheme, provides some information about the theme.
The new information, or rheme, provides some information about the theme.
Lexical reiteration Lexically reiterated items are likely candidates for antecedent (a NP scores 2 if is repeated within the same paragraph twice or more, 1 if repeated once and 0 if not).
"Non-prepositional" noun phrases A "pure", "non-prepositional" noun phrase is given a higher preference than a noun phrase which is part of a prepositional phrase (0, -1 ).
Example Insert the cassettei into the VCR making sure iti is suitable for the length of recording.
The latter proposes the ranking "subject, direct obÃÂ­ ject, indirect object" (Brennan et al. 1987) and noun phrases which are parts of prepositional phrases are usually indirect objects.
Press iti again.
The heuristics used is that in constructions of the form "...(You) V 1 NP ... con (you) V 2 it (con (you) V3 it)", where con e {and/or/before/after...}, the noun phrase immediately after V 1 is a very likely candidate for antecedent of the pronoun "it" immeÃÂ­ diately following V2 and is therefore given preference (scores 2 and 0).
It is also quite freÃÂ­ quent with imperative constructions.
Unwrap the paperiÃ¢â¬Â¢ form iti and align itiÃ¢â¬Â¢ then load iti into the drawer.
Term preference NPs representing terms in the field are more likely to be the antecedent than NPs which are not terms (score 1 if the NP is a term and 0 if not).
As already mentioned, each of the antecedent inÃÂ­ dicators assigns a score with a value {-1, 0, 1, 2}.
For inÃÂ­ stance, in the sentence "Insert the cassette into the VCRi making sure iti is turned on", the indicator "non-prepositional noun phrases" would penalise the correct antecedent.
Select from the noun phrases identified only.
those which agree in gender and numberS with the pronominal anaphor and group them as a set of potential candidates
For this purpose we have drawn up a compreÃÂ­ hensive list of all such cases; to our knowledge, no other computational treatment of pronominal anaphora resoluÃÂ­ tion has addressed the problem of "agreement excepÃÂ­ tions".

If collocational pattern suggests a tie or does not hold, select the candidate with higher score for indicating verbs.
There were 71 pronouns in the 140 page technical manual; 7 of the pronouns were non-anaphoric and 16 exophoric.
To avoid any terminological confusion, we shall therefore use the more neutral term "success rate" while discussing the evaluation.
Example Identify the draweq by the lit paper port LED and add paper to itj.
Usually knowledge-based apÃÂ­ proaches have difficulties in such a situation because they use preferences such as "syntactic parallelism" or "semantic parallelism".
As far as the typical failure cases are concerned, we anticipate the knowledge-poor approach to have difficulties with sentences which have a more comÃÂ­ plex syntactic structure.
where "blank sheet of paper" scores only 2 as opÃÂ­ posed to the "the paper through key" which scores 6.
where "blank sheet of paper" scores only 2 as opÃÂ­ posed to the "the paper through key" which scores 6.
3.2 Evaluation B. We carried out a second evaluation of the approach on a different set of sample texts from the genre of technical manuals (47-page Portable Style-Writer User's Guide (Stylewriter 1994).
Out of 223 proÃÂ­ nouns in the text, 167 were non-anaphoric (deictic and non-anaphoric "it").
In the second experiment we evaluated the apÃÂ­ proach from the point of view also of its "critical success rate".
A case where the system failed was when the anaphor and the antecedent were in the same senÃÂ­ tence and where preference was given to a candidate in the preceding sentence.

7 % 31.
If we regard as "discriminative power" of each antecedent indicator the ratio "number of successful antecedent identifications when this indicator was applied"/"number of applications of this indicator" (for the non-prepositional noun phrase and definiteÃÂ­ ness being penalising indicators, this figure is calcuÃÂ­ lated as the ratio "number of unsuccessful anteceÃÂ­ dent identifications"/"number of applications"), the immediate reference emerges as the most discrimiÃÂ­ native indicator (100%), followed by nonÃÂ­ prepositional noun phrase (92.2%), collocation (90.9%), section heading (61.9%), lexical reiteration (58.5%), givenness (49.3%), term preference (35.7%) and referential distance (34.4%).
3.3 Comparison to similar approaches comparaÃÂ­.
tive evaluation of Breck Baldwin's CogNIAC We felt appropriate to extend the evaluation of our approach by comparing it to Breck Baldwin's CogÃÂ­ NIAC (Baldwin 1997) approach which features "high precision coreference with limited knowledge and linguistics resources".
Given that our approach is robust and returns anÃÂ­ tecedent for each pronoun, in order to make the comparison as fair as possible, we used CogNIAC's "resolve all" version by simulating it manually on the same training data used in evaluation B above.

It would be fair to say that even though the results show superiority of our approach on the training data used (the genre of technical manuals), they cannot be generalised automatically for other genres or unrestricted texts and for a more accurate picture, further extensive tests are necessary.
While we acknowledge that most of the monolingual NLP approaches are not automatically transferable (with the same degree of efficiency) to other languages, it would be highly desirable if this could be done with minimal adaptaÃÂ­ tion.
Similarly to the evaluation for English, we comÃÂ­ pared the approach for Polish with (i) a Baseline Model which discounts candidates on the basis of agreement in number and gender and, if there were still competing candidates, selects as the antecedent the most recent subject matching the anaphor in gender and number (ii) a Baseline Model which checks agreement in number and gender and, if there were still more than one candidate left, picks up as the antecedent the most recent noun phrase that agrees with the anaphor.
We have also adapted and evaluated the approach for Polish (93.3 % success rate) and for Arabic (95.2% success rate).
