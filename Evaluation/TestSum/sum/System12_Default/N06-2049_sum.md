The character-based Ã¢â¬ÅIOBÃ¢â¬? tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).
Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as Ã¢â¬ËBÃ¢â¬â¢ if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or Ã¢â¬ËOÃ¢â¬â¢ if the character functions as an independent word, or Ã¢â¬ËIÃ¢â¬â¢ otherwise.Ã¢â¬? For example, Ã¢â¬? (whole) (Beijing city)Ã¢â¬? is labeled as Ã¢â¬? (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/IÃ¢â¬?.
We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.
We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.
In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.
Taking the same example mentioned above, Ã¢â¬Å (whole) (Beijing city)Ã¢â¬? is labeled as Ã¢â¬? (whole)/O (Beijing)/B (city)/IÃ¢â¬? in the subword-based tagging, where Ã¢â¬? (Beijing)/BÃ¢â¬? is labeled as one unit.
We will give a detailed description of this approach in Section 2.

In addition, we found a clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach It yields a very low in-vocabulary (IV) rate (R-iv) in return for a higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate (R-oov).
While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired.
In this work we propose a confidence measure approach to lessen the weakness.
Section 4 describes current state- of-the-art methods for Chinese word segmentation, with which our results were compared.
There are several steps to train a subword-based IOB tag- ger.
We chose all the single characters and the top multi- character words as a lexicon subset for the IOB tagging.
For example, Ã¢â¬Å (Beijing-city)Ã¢â¬? can be segmented as Ã¢â¬Å (Beijing-city)/O,Ã¢â¬? or Ã¢â¬Å (Beijing)/B (city)/I,Ã¢â¬? or Ã¢â¬? (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/I.Ã¢â¬? In this work we used forward maximal match (FMM) for disambiguation.
0 means the current word; Ã¢Ëâ1, Ã¢Ëâ2, the first or second word to the left; 1, 2, the first or second word to the right.
0 means the current word; Ã¢Ëâ1, Ã¢Ëâ2, the first or second word to the left; 1, 2, the first or second word to the right.
We defined a cutoff value for each feature type and selected the features with occurrence counts over the cutoff.
However, neither was perfect.
A confidence measure threshold, t, was defined for making a decision based on the value.
For the two extreme cases, t = 0 is the case of the IOB tagging while t = 1 is that of the dictionary-based approach.
We used the data provided by Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections.
3.1 Effects of the Character-based and the.
subword-based tagger The main difference between the character-based and the word-based is the contents of the lexicon subset used for re-segmentation.

In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of IOB tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation.
