Robust pronoun resolution with limited knowledge
Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge.
One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledge­ based system, however, is that it is a very labour­ intensive and time-consuming task.
This paper pres­ ents a robust, knowledge-poor approach to resolving pronouns in technical manuals, which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger.
Input is checked against agreement and for a number of antecedent indicators.
Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent.
Evaluation reports a success rate of 89.7% which is better than the suc­ cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data.
In addition, preliminary experiments show that the approach can be success­ fully adapted for other languages with minimum modifications.
For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell & Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria & Stallard 1989; Lappin & McCord 1990; Lappin & Leass 1994; Mitkov 1994; Rich & LuperFoy 1988; Sidner 1979; Webber 1979).
However, to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense.
While various alternatives have been proposed, making use of e.g. neural networks, a situation se­ mantics framework, or the principles of reasoning with uncertainty (e.g. Connoly et al. 1994; Mitkov 1995; Tin & Akman 1995), there is still a strong need for the development of robust
