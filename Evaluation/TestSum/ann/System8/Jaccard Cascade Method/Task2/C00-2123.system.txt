Word Re-ordering and DP-based Search in Statistical Machine Translation
In this paper, we describe a search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT) based on dynamic programming (DP).
Starting from a DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem, we present a novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language in order to achieve an e√Ücient search algorithm.
A search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented.
The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task (GermanEnglish, 8000-word vocabulary), which is a limited-domain spoken-language task.
The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language.
We are given a source string fJ 1 = f1:::fj :::fJ of length J, which is to be translated into a target string eI 1 = e1:::ei:::eI of length I. Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability: ^eI 1 = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1jfJ 1 )g = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1) Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1)g : (1) The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language.
Pr(eI 1) is the language model of the target language, whereas Pr(fJ 1 jeI1) is the transla tion model.
Our approach uses word-to-word dependencies between source and target words.
The model is often further restricted so that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word (Brown et
