Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation
We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: subword-based tagging and confidence measure approach.
We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with dictionary-based segmentation.
In addition, the latter can be used to balance out-of-vocabulary rates and in-vocabulary rates.
By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.
Under the scheme, each character of word is labeled as ‘B’ if it is the first character of multiple-character word, or ‘O’ if the character functions as an independent word, or ‘I’ otherwise.” For example, (whole) (Beijing city)” is labeled as (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/I”.
We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.
In this work we propose subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.
Taking the same example mentioned above, (whole) (Beijing city)” is labeled as (whole)/O (Beijing)/B (city)/I” in the subword-based tagging, where (Beijing)/B” is labeled as one unit.
In addition, we found clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach: It yields very low in-vocabulary (IV) rate (R-iv) in return for higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate (R-oov).
This approach will be described in Section 2.2.
In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is
