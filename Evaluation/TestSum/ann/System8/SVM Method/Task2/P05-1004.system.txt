Supersense Tagging of Unknown Nouns using Semantic Similarity
The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.
Lexicographers cannot possibly keep pace with language evolution: sense distinctions are continually made and merged, words are coined or become obsolete, and technical terms migrate into the vernacular.
Technical domains, such as medicine, require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings, and significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary.
Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only very small degree of overlap.
Also, lexical- semantic resources suffer from: bias towards concepts and senses from particular topics.
Some specialist topics are better covered in WORD- NET than others, e.g. dog has finer-grained distinctions than cat and worm although this does not reflect finer distinctions in reality; limited coverage of infrequent words and senses.
For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere (location) is different to exo- sphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers of the earthâ€™s atmosphere.
These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or semiautomatic methods for the creation and maintenance of lexical-semantic resources.
Broad semantic classification is currently used by lexicographers to or- ganise the manual insertion of words into WORDNET, and is an experimental precursor to automatically inserting words directly into the WORDNET hierarchy.
