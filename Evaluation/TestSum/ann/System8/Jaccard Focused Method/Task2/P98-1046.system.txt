Current approaches to English classifica­ tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limita­ tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes.
We have preliminary indications that the membership of our intersective sets will be more compatible with WordNet than the orig­ inal Levin classes.
We also have begun to ex­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties.
The only escape from this lim­ itation will be through the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisi­ tion.
The difficulty of achieving adequate hand­ crafted semantic representations has limited the field of natural language processing to applica­ tions that can be contained within well-defined subdomains.

In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.
We see verb classes as the key to making gen­ eralizations about regular extensions of mean­ ing.
What constitutes clear sepa­ ration into senses for any one verb, and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished?
We base these regular extensions on fine-grained variation on Levin classes, inter­ sective Levin classes, as source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.
We present refinement of Levin classes, intersec­ tive sets, which are more fine-grained clas­ sification and have more coherent sets of
