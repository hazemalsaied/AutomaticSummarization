The first stage identifies keyword in each phrase and joins phrases with the same keyword into sets.
We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.
We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.
If the expression is word or short phrase (like “corporation” and “company”), it is called “synonym”.
There has been lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.
We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.
Also, we don’t know how many such paraphrase sets are necessary to cover even some everyday things or events.
The second stage links sets which involve the same pairs of individual NEs.
So, there is limitation that IE can only be performed for predefined task, like “corporate mergers” or “management succession”.
So, it is too costly to make IE technology “open- domain” or “on-demand” like IR or QA.
Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.
In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from large untagged corpus.
In order to create an IE system for new domain, one has to spend long time to create the knowledge.
Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
One of the difficulties in Natural Language Processing is the fact that
