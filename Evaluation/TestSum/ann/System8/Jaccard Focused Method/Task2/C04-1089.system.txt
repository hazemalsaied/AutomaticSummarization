As such, the bilingual lexicon of machine translation system has to be constantly updated with these new word translations.
Comparable corpora such as news documents of the same period from different news agencies are readily available.
In this paper, we present new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information.
We evaluated our approach on six months of Chinese and English Gigaword corpora, with encouraging results.
Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).
In order for machine translation system to translate these new words correctly, its bilingual lexicon needs to be constantly updated with new word translations.
Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).
For example, various news agencies report major world events in different languages, and such news documents form readily available source of comparable corpora.
Comparable corpora refer to texts that are not direct translation but are about the same topic.
For example, the work of (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002a; AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of in translation.
New words such as person names, organization names, technical terms, etc. appear frequently.
While we have only tested our method on Chinese-English comparable corpora, our method is general and applicable to other language pairs.
In this paper, we propose new approach for the task of mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining
