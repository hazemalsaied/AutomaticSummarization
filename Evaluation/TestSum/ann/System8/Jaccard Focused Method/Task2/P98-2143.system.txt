This paper pres­ ents robust, knowledge-poor approach to resolving pronouns in technical manuals, which operates on texts pre-processed by part-of-speech tagger.
One of the disadvantages of developing knowledge­ based system, however, is that it is very labour­ intensive and time-consuming task.
Evaluation reports success rate of 89.7% which is better than the suc­ cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data.
Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent.
However, to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense.
In addition, preliminary experiments show that the approach can be success­ fully adapted for other languages with minimum modifications.
It is also an example of how anaphors in specific genre can be resolved quite successfully without any sophisticated linguistic knowledge or even without parsing.
Our work is continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaph­ ora resolution.
Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).
Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge.
If immediate reference has not been identified, then priority is given to the candi date with the best collocation pattern score.
Candidates are assigned score (-1, 0, or 2) for each indicator; the candidate with
