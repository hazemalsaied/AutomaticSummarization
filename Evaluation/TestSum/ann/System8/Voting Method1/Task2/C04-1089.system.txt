As such, the bilingual lexicon of machine translation system has to be constantly updated with these new word translations.
Comparable corpora such as news documents of the same period from different news agencies are readily available.
Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).
In order for machine translation system to translate these new words correctly, its bilingual lexicon needs to be constantly updated with new word translations.
Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).
For example, various news agencies report major world events in different languages, and such news documents form readily available source of comparable corpora.
Comparable corpora refer to texts that are not direct translation but are about the same topic.
For example, the work of (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002a; AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of in translation.
While we have only tested our method on Chinese-English comparable corpora, our method is general and applicable to other language pairs.
We use variant of Within IR, there is new approach to document retrieval called the language modeling approach (Ponte Croft, 98).
We fully implemented our method and tested it on ChineseEnglish comparable corpora.
rank these words e1 e2 ,..., ek according to the (Q (t average of their rank positions in the two lists.
Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring
