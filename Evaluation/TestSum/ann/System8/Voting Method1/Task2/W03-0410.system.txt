We cluster verbs into lexical semantic classes, using general set of noisy features that capture syntactic and semantic properties of the verbs.
The feature set was previously shown to work well in supervised learning setting, using known English verb classes.
Learning the argument structure properties of verbs—the semantic roles they assign and their mapping to syntactic positions—is both particularly important and difficult.
We investigate various approaches to feature selection, using both unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, comparing the results to subsets of features manually chosen according to linguistic properties.
It is also necessary to consider the probable lack of sophisticated grammars or text processing tools for extracting accurate features.
By avoiding the dependence on precise feature extraction, our approach should be more portable to new languages.
However, general feature space means that most features will be irrelevant to any given verb discrimination task.
We focus here on extending the applicability of unsupervised methods, as in (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), to the lexical semantic classification of verbs.
Thus, the problem of dimensionality reduction is key issue to be addressed in verb class discovery.
The Animacy Features (76 features) Semantic properties of the arguments that fill certain roles, such as animacy or motion, are more challenging to detect automatically.
Currently, our only such feature is an extension of the animacy feature of Merlo and Stevenson (2001).
Here we describe the selection of the experimental classes and verbs, and the estimation of the feature values.
