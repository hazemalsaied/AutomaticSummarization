This paper investigates the incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using SVM.
This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking.
The EDT task entails the detection of entity mentions and chaining them together by identifying their coreference.
For example, we want to determine whether person is at location, based on the evidence in the context.
The RDC task detects and classifies implicit and explicit relations1 between entities identified by the EDT task.
We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet (Miller 1990) and Name List can be used in the feature-based framework.
Implicit relations need not have explicit supporting evidence in text, though they should be evident from reading of the document.

Finally, we present experimental setting and results in Section and conclude with some general observations in relation extraction in Section 6.
Extraction of semantic relationships between entities can be very useful for applications such as question answering, e.g. to answer the query “Who is the president of the United States?”.
Zhang (2004) approached relation classification by combining various lexical and syntactic features with bootstrapping on top of Support Vector Machines.
Miller et al (2000) augmented syntactic full parse trees with semantic information corresponding to entities and relations, and built generative models for the augmented trees.
Extracting semantic relationships between entities is
