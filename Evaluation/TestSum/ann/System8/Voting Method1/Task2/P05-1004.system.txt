The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.
Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only very small degree of overlap.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.
These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or semiautomatic methods for the creation and maintenance of lexical-semantic resources.
For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere (location) is different to exo- sphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers of the earth’s atmosphere.
Also, lexical- semantic resources suffer from: bias towards concepts and senses from particular topics.

Lexicographers cannot possibly keep pace with language evolution: sense distinctions are continually made and merged, words are coined or become obsolete, and technical terms migrate into the vernacular.
Technical domains, such as medicine, require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings, and significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary.
These topic distinctions are coarser-grained than WORDNET senses, which have been criticised for being too difficult to distinguish even for experts.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNET’s hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained
