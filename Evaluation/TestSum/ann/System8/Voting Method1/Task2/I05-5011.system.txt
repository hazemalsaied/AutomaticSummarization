We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.
If the expression is word or short phrase (like “corporation” and “company”), it is called “synonym”.
We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.
So, it is too costly to make IE technology “open- domain” or “on-demand” like IR or QA.
Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.
In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from large untagged corpus.
Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.
Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task.
The sentences in the corpus were tagged by transformation-based chunker and an NE tagger.
Next, for each pair of NE categories, we collect all the contexts and find the keywords which are topical for that NE category pair.
Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.
Finally, we find links between sets of phrases, based on the NE instance pair data (for example, different phrases which link “IBM” and “Lotus”) (Step 4).
