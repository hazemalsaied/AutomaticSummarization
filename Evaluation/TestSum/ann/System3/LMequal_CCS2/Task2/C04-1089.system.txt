In this paper, we proposed a new method to mine new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining context and transliteration information, which are complementary sources of information. 
Shao and Ng  presented a method to mine new translations from Chinese and English news documents of the same period from different news agencies, combining both transliteration and context information. 
We evaluated our approach on six months of Chinese and English Gigaword corpora, with encouraging results. 
Hybrid methods exploit that a term or a named entity can be translated in various ways across languages. 
rank translation candidates using PH and CX independently and return results with the highest average rank. 
It also made use of part-of-speech tag information, whereas our method is simpler and does not require part-of- speech tagging. 
For example, the work of  used only the pronunciation or spelling of w in translation. 
At present, the methods for OOV term translation have changed from the basic pattern based on bilingual dictionary, transliteration or parallel corpus to the intermediate pattern based on comparable corpus. 
Koehn and Knight  attempted to combine multiple clues, including similar context and spelling. 
Some recent research used comparable corpora to re-score name transliterations. 
Various correlation measures have been used: log-likelihood ratio  represented contexts using language models. 
Their contextual semantic similarity model is different from our language modeling approach to measuring context similarity. 
Evaluation E C We processed news articles for an entire year in tion of maximum bipartite matching.
