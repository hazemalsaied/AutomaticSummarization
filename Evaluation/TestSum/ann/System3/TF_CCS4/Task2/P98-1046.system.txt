We also have begun to ex­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties. 
Besides the obvious influence of WordNet, this work is very much related to Palmer&amp;apos;s VerbNet project. 
This reorganization which was facilitated by the use of inter- sective Levin classes  refined the classes to account for semantic and syntactic differences within a class 
We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses. 
In this experiment, we have tried to choose the Portuguese verb that is most closely related to the description of the English verb in the Levin class. 
This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VN lexicon which is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levinâ€™s classification, called Intersective Levin classes. 
We think that many cases of ambiguÂ­ ous classification of the lexical entry for a verb can be addressed with the notion of intersective sets introduced by Dang et al.. 
Palmer  argue that syntactic frames and verb classes are useful for developing principled classifications of verbs.
