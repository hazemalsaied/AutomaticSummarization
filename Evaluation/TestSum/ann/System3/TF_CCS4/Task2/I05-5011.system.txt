We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities, and proceed in two stages. 
Also, the method of using keywords rules out phrases which don’t contain popular words in the domain. 
It is a relatively frequent word in the domain, but it can be used in different extraction scenarios. 
As was explained in the results section, “strength” or “add” are not desirable keywords in the CC-domain. 
The first stage identifies a keyword in each phrase and joins phrases with the same keyword into sets. 
In total 13,976 phrases are assigned to sets of phrases, and the accuracy on our evaluation data ranges from 65 to 99%, depending on the domain and the size of the sets. 
The accuracies for link were 73% and 86% on two evaluated domains. 
This problem arises because our keywords consist of only one word. 
We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. 
These results are promising and there are several avenues for improving on these results. 
While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system. 
This has led to active research on broad-scale acquisition of entailment rules for predicates, e.g.. 
Many methods for automatic acquisition of rules have been suggested in recent years, ranging from distributional similarity to finding shared contexts. 
Indeed, the prominent approach for evaluating the quality of rule acquisition algorithms is by human judgment of the learned rules.
