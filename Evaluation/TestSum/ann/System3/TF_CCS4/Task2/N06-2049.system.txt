We also successfully employed the confidence measure to make a confidence-dependent word segmentation. 
Part of the work using this tool was described by.The approach was reported to achieve the highest word segmentation accuracy using the data from the second Sighan Bakeoff. 
We achieved the highest F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora. 
Our results are listed together with the best results from Bakeoff 2005 in Table 4 in terms of F-scores. 
Consequently, many strategies are proposed to balance the IV and OOV performance. 
CRF + Rule system represents a combination of CRF model and rule based model presented in Zhang et al.. 
For this purpose, our system is based on a combination of subword-based tagging method. 
In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation. 
Our main contribution is to extend the IOB tagging approach from being a character-based to a subword-based. 
Using the CRFs approaches, we prove that it outperformed the character- based method using the CRF approaches. 
After we get word-based segmentation result, we use it to revise the CRF tagging result similar to. 
We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation. 
We found a speed up both in training and test. 
Some previous work  focus on employing lexical words or subwords as tagging units. 
This approach is effective for performing desired segmentation based on usersâ€™ requirements to R-oov and R-iv.
