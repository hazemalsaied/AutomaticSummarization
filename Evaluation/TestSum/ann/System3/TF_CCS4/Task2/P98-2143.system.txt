Evaluation reports a success rate of 89.7% which is better than the suc­ cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data. 
The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolv­ ing anaphors. 
We have also adapted and evaluated the approach for Polish. 
Mitkov showed that a salience-based approach can be applied across genres and without complex syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis. 
Indeed, existing learning-based approaches to anaphor resolution have performed reasonably well using limited and shallow knowledge, Soon et al. 
This paper pres­ ents a robust, knowledge-poor approach to resolving pronouns in technical manuals, which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger. 
This module resolves third-person personal pronouns and is an adaptation of Mitkovâ€™s robust, knowledge-poor multilingual approach. 
Mitkovâ€™s knowledge-poor pronoun resolution method, for example, uses the scores from a set of antecedent indicators to rank the candidates. 
Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent. 
Early work on pronoun anaphora resolution usually uses rule-based methods, which try to mine the cues of the relation between the pronouns and its antecedents. 
As expected, some of the preferences had to be modified in order to fit with specific features of Polish. 
Whereas knowledge-based systems like  address the problem without sophisticated linguistic knowledge. 
We selected for comparative evaluation three approaches extensively cited in the literature: Kennedy and Boguraevâ€™s parser- free version of Lappin and Leassâ€™ RAP.
