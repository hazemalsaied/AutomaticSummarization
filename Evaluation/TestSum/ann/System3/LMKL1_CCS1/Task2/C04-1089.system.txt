To our knowledge, this association measure has not been used yet in translation spotting.It is computed as:. 
Various correlation measures have been used: log-likelihood ratio  represented contexts using language models. 
Their contextual semantic similarity model is different from our language modeling approach to measuring context similarity. 
We evaluated our approach on six months of Chinese and English Gigaword corpora, with encouraging results. 
Shao and Ng  presented a method to mine new translations from Chinese and English news documents of the same period from different news agencies, combining both transliteration and context information. 
In this paper, we proposed a new method to mine new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining context and transliteration information, which are complementary sources of information. 
Some recent research used comparable corpora to re-score name transliterations. 
rank translation candidates using PH and CX independently and return results with the highest average rank. 
Evaluation E C We processed news articles for an entire year in tion of maximum bipartite matching. 
Koehn and Knight  attempted to combine multiple clues, including similar context and spelling. 
They attempted to improve named entity translation by combining phonetic and semantic information. 
Hybrid methods exploit that a term or a named entity can be translated in various ways across languages. 
For example, the work of  used only the pronunciation or spelling of w in translation. 
It also made use of part-of-speech tag information, whereas our method is simpler and does not require part-of- speech tagging.
