In total 13,976 phrases are assigned to sets of phrases, and the accuracy on our evaluation data ranges from 65 to 99%, depending on the domain and the size of the sets. 
The accuracy of the sets in representing paraphrase ranged from 73% to 99%, depending on the NE categories and set sizes; the accuracy of the links for two evaluated domains was 73% and 86%. 
The accuracies for link were 73% and 86% on two evaluated domains. 
It is a relatively frequent word in the domain, but it can be used in different extraction scenarios. 
Similarly,  improved information retrieval based on pattern recognition by introducing paraphrase generation. 
We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities, and proceed in two stages. 
These results are promising and there are several avenues for improving on these results. 
This has led to active research on broad-scale acquisition of entailment rules for predicates, e.g.. 
Many methods for automatic acquisition of rules have been suggested in recent years, ranging from distributional similarity to finding shared contexts. 
After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kind of cue. 
We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. 
The first stage identifies a keyword in each phrase and joins phrases with the same keyword into sets. 
Some existing entailment acquisition algorithms can add contextual constraints to the learned rules, but most donâ€™t.
