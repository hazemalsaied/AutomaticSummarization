In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation. 
Our main contribution is to extend the IOB tagging approach from being a character-based to a subword-based. 
Using the CRFs approaches, we prove that it outperformed the character- based method using the CRF approaches. 
After we get word-based segmentation result, we use it to revise the CRF tagging result similar to. 
We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation. 
We found a speed up both in training and test. 
Consequently, many strategies are proposed to balance the IV and OOV performance. 
CRF + Rule system represents a combination of CRF model and rule based model presented in Zhang et al.. 
For this purpose, our system is based on a combination of subword-based tagging method. 
This approach is effective for performing desired segmentation based on users’ requirements to R-oov and R-iv. 
We also successfully employed the confidence measure to make a confidence-dependent word segmentation. 
Our results are listed together with the best results from Bakeoff 2005 in Table 4 in terms of F-scores. 
We achieved the highest F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora. 
We chose the three models that achieved at least one best score in the closed tests from Emerson  for comparison. 
For AS corpus, “Adam Smith” are two words in the training but become a one- word in the test, “AdamSmith”.
