We also have begun to ex­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties. 
We also plan to experiment with different classification schemes for verb semantics such as WordNet. 
Dang et al., for example, have refined the current classification by creating intersective classes for those verbs which share membership of more than one Levin class. 
We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses. 
VN is built on a refinement of the Levin classes, the intersective Levin classes, aimed at achieving more coherent classes both semantically and syntactically. 
This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VN lexicon which is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levinâ€™s classification, called Intersective Levin classes. 
Palmer  argue that syntactic frames and verb classes are useful for developing principled classifications of verbs. 
In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. 
In computational linguistics, the VerbNet project  bear relation to this work.
