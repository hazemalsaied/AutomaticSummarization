It is composed of three parts: a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging.

The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation.
Even with the use of confidence measure, the word- based IOB tagging still outperformed the character-based IOB tagging.
We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation.
We found the results in Table 3 were better than those in Table 2 and Table 1, which prove that using confidence measure approach achieved the best performance over the dictionary-based segmentation and the IOB tagging approach.
In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of IOB tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation.
Before moving to this step in Figure 1, we produced two segmentation results: the one by the dictionary-based approach and the one by the IOB tagging.
If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used.
The segmentation results using CRF tagging are shown in Table 2, where the upper numbers of each slot were produced by the character-based approach while the lower numbers were of the subword-based.
