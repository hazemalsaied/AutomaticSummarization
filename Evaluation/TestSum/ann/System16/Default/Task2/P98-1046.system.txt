motion Figure 3 shows intersective classes involving two classes of verbs of manner of motion (run and roll verbs) and a class of verbs of existence (me足 ander verbs).
Figure 2: Intersective class formed from Levin carry, push/pull and split verbs- verbs in() are not listed by Levin in all the intersecting classes but participate in all the alternations The intersection between the push/pull verbs of exerting force, the carry verbs and the split verbs illustrates how the force semantic compo足 nent of a verb can also be used to extend its meaning so that one can infer a causation of accompanied motion.
Although the Levin classes that make up an intersective class may have conflicting alterna足 tions {e.g., verbs of exerting force can take the conative alternation, while carry verbs cannot), this does not invalidate the semantic regularity of the intersective class.
This is exemplified by the Levin cut verbs and the intersective class formed by the cut verbs and split verbs.
"Meander Verbs" Figure 3: Intersections between roll and run verbs of motion and meander verbs of existence 4 Cross-linguistic verb classes.
We also investigated the Portuguese translation of some intersective classes of motion verbs.
However, apart can also be used with other classes of verbs, including many verbs of motion.
As can be seen in Table 2 the alternations for the Portuguese translations of the verbs in this intersective class indicate that they share simi足 lar properties with the English verbs, including the causative/inchoative.
These verbs are listed in the intersective classes with meander verbs of existence.
