This larger corpus was kindly provided to us by United Informatics Inc., R.O.C. a set of initial estimates of the word frequencies.9 In this re-estimation procedure only the entries in the base dictionary were used: in other words, derived words not in the base dictionary and personal and foreign names were not used.
The first probability is estimated from a name count in a text database, and the rest of the probabilities are estimated from a large list of personal names.n Note that in Chang et al.'s model the p(rule 9) is estimated as the product of the probability of finding G 1 in the first position of a two-hanzi given name and the probability of finding G2 in the second position of a two-hanzi given name, and we use essentially the same estimate here, with some modifications as described later on.
Note that hanzi that are not grouped into dictionary words (and are not identified as single­ hanzi words), or into one of the other categories of words discussed in this paper, are left unattached and tagged as unknown words.
This class-based model gives reasonable results: for six radical classes, Table 1 gives the estimated cost for an unseen hanzi in the class occurring as the second hanzi in a double GIVEN name.
G1 and G2 are hanzi, we can estimate the probability of the sequence being a name as the product of: • the probability that a word chosen randomly from a text will be a name-p(rule 1), and • the probability that the name is of the form 1hanzi-family 2hanzi-given-p(rule 2), and • the probability that the family name is the particular hanzi F1-p(rule 6), and • the probability that the given name consists of the particular hanzi G1 and G2-p(rule 9) This model is essentially the one proposed in Chang et al.
