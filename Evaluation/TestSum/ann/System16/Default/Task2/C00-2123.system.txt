During the search process, a partial hypothesis is extended by choosing a source sentence position, which has not been aligned with a target sentence position yet.
e0; e are the last two target words, C is a coverage set for the already covered source positions and j is the last position visited.
Source sentence words are aligned with hypothesized target sentence words, where the choice of a new source word, which has not been aligned with a target word yet, is restricted1.
The translation of one position in the source sentence may be postponed for up to L = 3 source positions, and the translation of up to two source positions may be anticipated for at most R = 10 source positions.
We show translation results for three approaches: the monotone search (MonS), where no word reordering is allowed (Tillmann, 1997), the quasimonotone search (QmS) as presented in this paper and the IBM style (IbmS) search as described in Section 3.2.
For Ã† = 0, no new target word is generated, while an additional source sentence position is covered.
Our new approach, which is called quasi-monotone search, processes the source sentence monotonically, while explicitly taking into account the positions of the German verbgroup.
For the translation model Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1), we go on the assumption that each source word is aligned to exactly one target word.
The restriction can be expressed in terms of the number of uncovered source sentence positions to the left of the rightmost position m in the coverage set.
