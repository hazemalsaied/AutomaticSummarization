It shows that our system achieves the performance of 84.8%/66.7%/74.7 in precision/recall/F- measure on relation detection.

Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement. ÃḃÂáẁ PTP: path of phrase labels (removing duplicates) connecting M1 and M2 in the parse tree ÃḃÂáẁ PTPH: path of phrase labels (removing duplicates) connecting M1 and M2 in the parse tree augmented with the head word of the top phrase in the path. The ACE corpus is gathered from various newspapers, newswire and broadcasts. ÃḃÂáẁ Chunking features are very useful. Here, the base phrase chunks are derived from full parse trees using the Perl script5 written by Sabine Buchholz from Tilburg University and the CollinsÃḃÂÂ parser (Collins 1999) is employed for full parsing. Moreover, we only apply the simple linear kernel, although other kernels can peform better. Although tree kernel-based approaches facilitate the exploration of the implicit feature space with the parse tree structure, yet the current technologies are expected to be further advanced to be effective for relatively complicated relation extraction tasks such as the one defined in ACE where 5 types and 24 subtypes need to be extracted. (1999). It also shows that our system achieves overall performance of 77.2%/60.7%/68.0 and 63.1%/49.5%/55.5 in precision/recall/F-measure on the 5 ACE relation types and the best-reported systems on
