Here, the base phrase chunks are derived from full parse trees using the Perl script5 written by Sabine Buchholz from Tilburg University and the CollinsÃḃÂÂ parser (Collins 1999) is employed for full parsing.

Instead of exploring the full parse tree information directly as previous related work, we incorporate the base phrase chunking information performance improvement from syntactic aspect while further incorporation of the parse tree and dependence tree information only slightly improves the performance. Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement. It shows that our system achieves the performance of 84.8%/66.7%/74.7 in precision/recall/F- measure on relation detection.
