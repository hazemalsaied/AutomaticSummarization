Curran and Moens (2002b) compared several context extraction methods and found that the shallow pipeline and grammatical relation extraction used in SEXTANT was both extremely fast and produced high-quality results. Finally, SEXTANT collapses the nn, nnprep and adj relations together into a single broad noun-modifier grammatical relation. Instead, we use vector-space similarity to retrieve a number of synonyms for each unknown common noun. We describe an unsupervised approach, based on vector-space similarity, which does not require annotated examples but significantly outperforms their tagger. We also demonstrate the use of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for calculating vector-space semantic similarity. Our approach to vector-space similarity is based on the SEXTANT system described in Grefenstette (1994). There are many parameters to consider: ÃḃÂáẁ how many extracted synonyms to use; ÃḃÂáẁ how to weight each synonymÃḃÂÂs vote; ÃḃÂáẁ whether unreliable synonyms should be filtered out; ÃḃÂáẁ how to deal with polysemous synonyms. Such a corpus is needed to acquire reliable contextual information for the often very rare nouns we are attempting to supersense tag. We have experimented with several parameters finding that the best configuration uses 50 extracted synonyms, filtered by frequency and number of contexts to increase their reliability. Here, the t-test compares the joint and product probability distributions of the headword and context: 6.3 Grammatical Relation Extraction. However, our early experiments suggest that this produces extremely large vectors which do not match well against the much smaller vectors of each unseen word. There are a number of problems our system does
