However there is no global pruning. The translation direction is from German to English. SSER: subjective sentence error rate: For a more detailed analysis, the translations are judged by a human test person. The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task (GermanEnglish, 8000-word vocabulary), which is a limited-domain spoken-language task. In this case, we have no finite-state restrictions for the search space. The resulting algorithm has a complexity of O(n!). For the error counts, a range from 0:0 to 1:0 is used. Here, the pruning threshold t0 = 10:0 is used. input: source string f1:::fj :::fJ initialization for each cardinality c = 1; 2; ; J do for each pair (C; j), where j 2 C and jCj = c do for each target word e 2 E Qe0 (e; C; j) = p(fj je) max ÃÂ;e00 j02Cnfjg fp(jjj0; J) p(ÃÂ) pÃÂ(eje0; e00) Qe00 (e0;C n fjg; j0)g words fj in the input string of length J.

The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language. We are given a source string fJ 1 = f1:::fj :::fJ of length J, which is to be translated into a target
