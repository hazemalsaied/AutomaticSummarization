Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement. It also shows that our fea 1 In ACE (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Projects/ACE),. The ACE corpus is gathered from various newspapers, newswire and broadcasts. In this paper, we separate the features of base phrase chunking from those of full parsing. (1999). Country Name List This is to differentiate the relation subtype ÃḃÂÂROLE.Citizen-OfÃḃÂÂ, which defines the relationship between a person and the country of the personÃḃÂÂs citizenship, from other subtypes, especially ÃḃÂÂROLE.ResidenceÃḃÂÂ, where defines the relationship between a person and the location in which the person lives. For example, we want to determine whether a person is at a location, based on the evidence in the context. It shows that our system achieves the performance of 84.8%/66.7%/74.7 in precision/recall/F- measure on relation detection. Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information contributes to most of the performance inprovement from syntactic aspect while additional full parsing information does not contribute much, largely due to the fact that most of relations defined in ACE corpus are within a very short distance. Although tree kernel-based approaches facilitate the exploration of the implicit feature space with the parse tree structure, yet the current technologies are expected to be further advanced to be effective for relatively complicated relation extraction tasks such as the one defined in ACE where 5 types and 24
