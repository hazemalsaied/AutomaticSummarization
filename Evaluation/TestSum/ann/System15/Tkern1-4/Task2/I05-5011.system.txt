Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task. Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically. We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications. However, there are phrases which express the same meanings even though they do not share the same keyword. For example, in the phrase ÃḃÂÂCompany-A last week purchased rival Marshalls from Company-BÃḃÂÂ, the purchased company is Marshalls, not Company-B. Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01]. However, those methods need initial seeds, so the relation between entities has to be known in advance. More examples are shown in Figure 5. There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora. For example, in the CC-domain, 96 keywords are found which have TF/ITF scores above a threshold; some of them are shown in Figure 3. So, it is too costly to make IE technology ÃḃÂÂopen- domainÃḃÂÂ or ÃḃÂÂon-demandÃḃÂÂ like IR or QA. Applications The discovered paraphrases have multiple applications. Because of this threshold, very few NE instance pairs could be used and hence the variety of phrases was also limited. We focus on phrases which connect
