Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task. We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications. However, there are phrases which express the same meanings even though they do not share the same keyword. Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically. Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01]. We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications. More examples are shown in Figure 5. For example, in the phrase ÃḃÂÂCompany-A last week purchased rival Marshalls from Company-BÃḃÂÂ, the purchased company is Marshalls, not Company-B. Our clue is the NE instance pairs. However, those methods need initial seeds, so the relation between entities has to be known in advance. We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages. Applications The discovered paraphrases have multiple applications. For example, in the CC-domain, 96 keywords are found which have TF/ITF scores above a threshold; some of them are shown in Figure 3. One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose
