The "Baseline subject" model tested on the same data scored 33.9% recall and 67.9% precision, whereas "Baseline most recent" scored 66.7%. Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7% for the genre of techÃÂ­ nical manuals and at least in this genre, the approach appears to be more successful than other similar methods. Top symptoms like "lexical reiteration" asÃÂ­ sign score "2" whereas "non-prepositional" noun phrases are given a negative score of "-1". Our evaluaÃÂ­ tion, based on 63 examples (anaphors) from a techÃÂ­ nical manual (Sony 1992), indicates a success rate of 95.2% (and critical success rate 89.3 %). Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge. There might be cases where one or more of the antecedent indicators do not "point" to the correct antecedent. The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolvÃÂ­ ing anaphors (with critical success rate of 86.2%). Our evaluation, however, suggests that much less is lost than might be feared. Candidates are assigned a score (-1, 0, 1 or 2) for each indicator; the candidate with the highest aggregate score is proposed as the anteÃÂ­ cedent. As expected, some of the preferences had to be modified in order to fit with specific features of Polish (Mitkov & Stys 1997). Also, a sequence of noun phrases with the same head counts as lexical reiteration (e.g. "toner bottle", "bottle of toner", "the bottle"). Definiteness Definite noun phrases in previous sentences are more likely antecedents of
