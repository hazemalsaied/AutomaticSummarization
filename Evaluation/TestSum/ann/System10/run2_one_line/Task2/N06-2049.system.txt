Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation
We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.
In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.
In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method.
Section 4 describes current state- of-the-art methods for Chinese word segmentation, with which our results were compared.
Our word segmentation process is illustrated in Fig.
Since this work was to evaluate the proposed subword-based IOB tagging, we carried out the closed test only.

The segmentation results using CRF tagging are shown in Table 2, where the upper numbers of each slot were produced by the character-based approach while the lower numbers were of the subword-based.
In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of IOB tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation.
We found the results in Table 3 were better than those in Table 2 and Table 1, which prove that using confidence measure approach achieved the best performance over the dictionary-based segmentation and the IOB tagging approach.
In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation.
