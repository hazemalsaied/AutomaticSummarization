(2006) were proposed.
Among these strategies, the confidence measure used to combine the results of CT and DS is a straightforward one, which is introduced in (Zhang et al., 2006a).
Thus, the bigram â€œRAIL ENQUIRIESâ€\x9d gives a misleading probability that â€œRAILâ€\x9d is followed by â€œENQUIRIESâ€\x9d irrespective of what precedes it.
If the confidence of a character is lower than the threshold, the tag of that character will be adjusted to the tag assigned by the Maximum Probability Segmentation (R. Zhang et al., 2006).

After we get word-based segmentation result, we use it to revise the CRF tagging result similar to (Zhang et al., 2006).
We chose the three models that achieved at least one best score in the closed tests from Emerson (2005), as well as the sub-word-based model of Zhang, Kikui, and Sumita (2006) for comparison.
We also successfully employed the confidence measure to make a confidence-dependent word segmentation.
The character-based “IOB” tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).
The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation.
The effect of the confidence measure is shown in Table 3, where we used α = 0.7 and confidence threshold t = 0.8.
We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation.
