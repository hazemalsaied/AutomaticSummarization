We also proposed a method to find paraphrases in the context of two Named Entity instances in a large un-annotated corpus (Sekine 05).
This sparked intensive research on unsupervised acquisition of entailment rules (and similarly paraphrases) e.g.
Consequently, sub stantial effort has been made to learn such rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008; Schoenmackers et al., 2010).
(Sekine, 2005), (CallisonBurch, 2008)), but most do not.
A number of automatically acquired inference rule/paraphrase collections are available, such as (Szpektor et al., 2004), (Sekine, 2005).
The coverage of u by v is measured bypare between these complex features of t and tl (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005).
Figure 2 shows examples of extracted NE pair instances and their contexts.
After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue.
Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task.
If the same pair of NE instances is used with different phrases, these phrases are likely to be paraphrases.
Keywords with more than one word In the evaluation, we explained that “chairman” and “vice chairman” are considered paraphrases.
For example, the two NEs “Eastern Group Plc” and “Hanson Plc” have the following contexts.
