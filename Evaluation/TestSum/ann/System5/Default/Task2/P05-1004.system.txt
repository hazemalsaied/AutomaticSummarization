There are, however, approaches to the complementary problem of determining the closest known sense for unknown words (Widdows, 2003; Curran, 2005; Burchardt et al., 2005), which can be viewed as the logical next step after unknown sense detection.
More re cently, the task of automatic supersense tagging has emerged for English (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Curran, 2005; Ciaramita and Altun, 2006; PaaÃŸ and Reichartz, 2009), as well as for Italian (Picca et al., 2008; Picca et al., 2009; Attardi et al., 2010) and Chinese (Qiu et al., 2011), languages with WordNetsmapped to English WordNet.3 In principle, we be lieve supersenses ought to apply to nouns and verbsin any language, and need not depend on the avail ability of a semantic lexicon.4 In this work we focuson the noun SSTs, summarized in figure 2 and ap plied to an Arabic sentence in figure 1.
Instead, we use vector-space similarity to retrieve a number of synonyms for each unknown common noun.
However, sometimes the unknown noun does not appear in our 2 billion word corpus, or at least does not appear frequently enough to provide sufficient contextual information to extract reliable synonyms.
He first extracts synonyms for the unknown word using vector-space similarity measures based on Latent Semantic Analysis and then searches for a location in the hierarchy nearest to these synonyms.
Further, our similarity system does not currently incorporate multi-word terms.
A disadvantage of this similarity approach is that it requires full synonym extraction, which compares the unknown word against a large number of words when, in S Y S T E M W N 1.6 W N 1.7 .1 Cia ra mit a an d Joh nso n bas eli ne 2 1 % 2 8 % Cia ra mit a an d Joh nso n per cep tro n 5 3 % 5 3 % Si mil arit y bas ed res ult s 6 8 % 6 3 % Table 6: Summary of supersense tagging accuracies fact, we want to calculate the similarity to a small number of supersenses.
