Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
Recently , this topic has been getting more attention , as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004 , driven by the needs of various NLP applications . 
For example , we can easily imagine that the number of paraphrases for âA buys Bâ is enormous and it is not possible to create a comprehensive inventory by hand . 
Up to now , most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge ( or IE patterns ) by hand and for specific tasks . 
After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger , the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue .

Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
One of the difficulties in Natural Language Processing is the fact that there are many ways to express the same thing or event . 
As a later reï¬nement , Sekine ( 2005 ) makes a similar attempt at using distributional similarity over named entity pairs in order to produce a list of fully lexical phrasal paraphrases for specific concepts represented by keywords . 
The basic strategy is , for a given pair of entity types , to start with some examples , like several famous book title and author pairs ; and find expressions which contains those names ; then using the found expressions , find more author and book title pairs .

In this paper , we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus .

However , those methods need initial seeds , so the relation between entities has to be known in advance .

We agree with Sekine ( 2005 ) who claims that several different methods are required to discover a wider variety of paraphrases .

Here , the term frequency ( TF ) is the frequency of a word in the bag and the inverse term frequency ( ITF ) is the inverse of the log of the frequency in the entire corpus . 
They contain about 200M words ( 25M , 110M , 40M and 19M words , respectively ) .

For example , we can easily imagine that the number of paraphrases for âA buys Bâ is enormous and it is not possible to create a comprehensive inventory by hand . 
For example , in Figure 3 , we can see that the phrases in the âbuyâ acquire and purchase sets are mostly paraphrases .
