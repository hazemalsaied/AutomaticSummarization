The heuristics used is that in constructions of the form "...(You) V 1 NP ... con (you) V 2 it (con (you) V3 it)", where con e {and/or/before/after...}, the noun phrase immediately after V 1 is a very likely candidate for antecedent of the pronoun "it" imme­ diately following V2 and is therefore given preference (scores 2 and 0).
When all preferences (antecedent indicators) are taken into account, however, the right antecedent is still very likely to be tracked down - in the above example, the "non-prepositional noun phrases" heuristics (penalty) would be overturned by the "collocational preference" heuristics.
The antecedent indicators have been identi­ fied empirically and are related to salience (definiteness, givenness, indicating verbs, lexical reiteration, section heading preference, "non­ prepositional" noun phrases), to structural matches (collocation, immediate reference), to referential distance or to preference of terms.
It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as "antecedent indicators").
The approach works as follows: it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the re­ maining candidates (see next section).
From this example we can also see that our knowledge-poor approach successfully tackles cases in which the anaphor and the· antecedent have not only different syntactic functions but also different semantic roles.
