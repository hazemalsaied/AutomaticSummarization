Word Re-ordering and DP-based Search in Statistical Machine Translation
In this paper, we describe search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT) based on dynamic programming (DP).
Starting from DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem, we present novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language in order to achieve an e√Ücient search algorithm.
The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task (GermanEnglish, 8000-word vocabulary), which is limited-domain spoken-language task.
The goal of machine translation is the translation of text given in some source language into target language.
Pr(eI 1) is the language model of the target language, whereas Pr(fJ jeI1) is the transla tion model.
Our approach uses word-to-word dependencies between source and target words.
The model is often further restricted so that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word (Brown et al., 1993; Ney et al., 2000).
These alignment models are similar to the concept of hidden Markov models (HMM) in speech recognition.
The alignment mapping is aj from source position to target position aj The use of this alignment model raises major problems if source word has to be aligned to several target words, e.g. when translating German compound nouns.
In Section 3, we introduce our novel concept to word reordering and DP-based search, which is especially suitable for the translation direction from German to English.
In Section 4, we present the performance measures used and give translation results on the Verbmobil task.
