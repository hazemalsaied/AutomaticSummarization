Semi-supervised Verb Class Discovery Using Noisy Features
We cluster verbs into lexical semantic classes, using general set of noisy features that capture syntactic and semantic properties of the verbs.
The feature set was previously shown to work well in supervised learning setting, using known English verb classes.
We investigate various approaches to feature selection, using both unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, comparing the results to subsets of features manually chosen according to linguistic properties.
Learning the argument structure properties of verbs—the semantic roles they assign and their mapping to syntactic positions—is both particularly important and difficult.
number of supervised learning approaches have extracted such information about verbs from corpora, including their argument roles (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), selectional preferences (Resnik, 1996), and lexical semantic classification (i.e., grouping verbs according to their argument structure properties) (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Lapata and Brew, 1999; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Joanis and Stevenson, 2003).
Unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches have been successful as well, but have tended to be more restrictive, in relying on human filtering of the results (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998), on the hand- selection of features (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), or on the use of an extensive grammar (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002).
We focus here on extending the applicability of unsupervised methods, as in (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), to the lexical semantic classification of verbs.
It is also necessary to consider the probable lack of sophisticated grammars or text processing tools for extracting accurate features.
