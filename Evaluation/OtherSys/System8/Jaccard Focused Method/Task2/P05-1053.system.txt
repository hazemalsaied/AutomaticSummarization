This paper investigates the incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using SVM.
This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking.
We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance.
In ACE vocabulary, entities are objects, mentions are references to them, and relations are semantic relationships between entities.
The EDT task entails the detection of entity mentions and chaining them together by identifying their coreference.
For example, we want to determine whether person is at location, based on the evidence in the context.
The RDC task detects and classifies implicit and explicit relations1 between entities identified by the EDT task.
Information Extraction (IE) systems are expected to identify relevant information (usually of predefined types) from text documents in certain domain and put them in structured format.
We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet (Miller 1990) and Name List can be used in the feature-based framework.
Entities can be of five types: persons, organizations, locations, facilities and geopolitical entities (GPE: geographically defined regions that indicate political boundary, e.g. countries, states, cities, etc.).
Implicit relations need not have explicit supporting evidence in text, though they should be evident from reading of the document.
This paper focuses on the ACE RDC task and employs diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using Support Vector
