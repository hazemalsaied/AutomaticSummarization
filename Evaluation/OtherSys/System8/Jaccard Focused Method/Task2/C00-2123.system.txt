In this paper, we describe search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT) based on dynamic programming (DP).
The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task (GermanEnglish, 8000-word vocabulary), which is limited-domain spoken-language task.
The goal of machine translation is the translation of text given in some source language into target language.
Pr(eI 1) is the language model of the target language, whereas Pr(fJ jeI1) is the transla tion model.
search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented.
These alignment models are similar to the concept of hidden Markov models (HMM) in speech recognition.
Word Re-ordering and DP-based Search in Statistical Machine Translation
The model is often further restricted so that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word (Brown et al., 1993; Ney et al., 2000).
In Section 4, we present the performance measures used and give translation results on the Verbmobil task.
This approach is compared to another reordering scheme presented in (Berger et al., 1996).
In Section 3, we introduce our novel concept to word reordering and DP-based search, which is especially suitable for the translation direction from German to English.
Our approach uses word-to-word dependencies between source and target words.
In Section 2, we brie review our approach to statistical machine translation.
(1), Pr(eI 1) is the language model, which is trigram language model in this case.
When aligning the words in parallel texts (for language pairs like SpanishEnglish, French-English, ItalianGerman,...), we typically observe strong localization effect.
