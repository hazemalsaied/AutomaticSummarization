We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: subword-based tagging and confidence measure approach.
In addition, the latter can be used to balance out-of-vocabulary rates and in-vocabulary rates.
By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.
We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.
If only Chinese characters are used, the subword-based IOB tagging is downgraded into character-based one.
Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation
While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, higher IV rate is also desired.
We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with dictionary-based segmentation.
By this approach we can change R-oovs and R-ivs and find an optimal tradeoff.
We will give detailed description of this approach in Section 2.
Section describes current state- of-the-art methods for Chinese word segmentation, with which our results were compared.
In this work we propose confidence measure approach to lessen the weakness.
The character-based “IOB” tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).
In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method.
Taking the same example mentioned above, (whole) (Beijing city)” is labeled as (whole)/O (Beijing)/B (city)/I” in the subword-based tagging, where
