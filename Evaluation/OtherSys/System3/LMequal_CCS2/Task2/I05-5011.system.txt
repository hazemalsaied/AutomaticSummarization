We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. 
After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kind of cue. 
Many methods for automatic acquisition of rules have been suggested in recent years, ranging from distributional similarity to finding shared contexts. 
This has led to active research on broad-scale acquisition of entailment rules for predicates, e.g.. 
While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system. 
These results are promising and there are several avenues for improving on these results. 
It is a relatively frequent word in the domain, but it can be used in different extraction scenarios. 
The first stage identifies a keyword in each phrase and joins phrases with the same keyword into sets. 
In total 13,976 phrases are assigned to sets of phrases, and the accuracy on our evaluation data ranges from 65 to 99%, depending on the domain and the size of the sets. 
The accuracy of the sets in representing paraphrase ranged from 73% to 99%, depending on the NE categories and set sizes; the accuracy of the links for two evaluated domains was 73% and 86%. 
The accuracies for link were 73% and 86% on two evaluated domains. 
We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities, and proceed in two stages.
