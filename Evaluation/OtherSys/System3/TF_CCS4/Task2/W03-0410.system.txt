We find that manual selection of a subset of features based on the known classification performs better than using a full set of noisy features, demonstrating the potential benefit of feature selection in our task. 
As successful as our seed set of features is, it still does not achieve the accuracy of a supervised learner. 
We instead proposed a semi-supervised method in which a seed set of verbs is chosen for training a supervised classifier, from which the useful features are extracted for use in clustering. 
Supervised methods for automatic verb classification have been extensively investigated. 
Table 1 shows our results and the results of Stevenson and Joanis  on T1 when employing AGG using Ward as the linkage criterion. 
In recent work, Stevenson and Joanis, which used an entropy measure to organize data into a multidimensional space. 
Our feature set is essentially a generalization of theirs, but in scaling up the feature space to be useful across English verb classes in general, we necessarily face a dimensionality problem that did not arise in their research. 
Furthermore, we might question the clustering approach itself, in the context of verb class discovery. 
In moving to a scenario of verb class discovery, using clustering, we face the problem of having a large number of irrelevant features for a particular clustering task. 
Performance differences may be due to the types of features, or due to the number or size of classes.
