In total 13,976 phrases are assigned to sets of phrases, and the accuracy on our evaluation data ranges from 65 to 99%, depending on the domain and the size of the sets. 
The accuracies for link were 73% and 86% on two evaluated domains. 
This has led to active research on broad-scale acquisition of entailment rules for predicates, e.g.. 
While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system. 
These results are promising and there are several avenues for improving on these results. 
It is a relatively frequent word in the domain, but it can be used in different extraction scenarios. 
As was explained in the results section, “strength” or “add” are not desirable keywords in the CC-domain. 
The first stage identifies a keyword in each phrase and joins phrases with the same keyword into sets. 
After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kind of cue. 
We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. 
Some existing entailment acquisition algorithms can add contextual constraints to the learned rules, but most donâ€™t. 
Sometime, multiple words are needed, like “vice chairman”, “prime minister” or “pay for”. 
This problem arises because our keywords consist of only one word. 
We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities, and proceed in two stages.
