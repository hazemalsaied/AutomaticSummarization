The model described here thus demonstrates great potential for use in widespread applications. 
While size of the resulting transducers may seem daunting-the segmenter described here, as it is used in the Bell Labs Mandarin TTS system has about 32,000 states and 209,000 arcs-recent work on minimization of weighted machines and transducers (cf. 
Furthermore, by inverting the transducer so that it maps from phonemic transcriptions to hanzi sequences, one can apply the segmenter to other problems, such as speech recognition. 
Since the transducers are built from human-readable descriptions using a lexical toolkit, the system is easily maintained and extended. 
We used a maximum- matching algorithm and a dictionary compiled from the CTB  to do segmentation

Many natural language models can be captured by weighted finite-state transducers, which offer several benefits:â€¢ WFSTs provide a uniform knowledge represen tation. 
Despite these limitations, a purely finite-state approach to Chinese word segmentation enjoys a number of strong advantages. 
As described in Sproat, the Chinese segmenter presented here fits directly into the context of a broader finite-state model of text analysis for speech synthesis. 
A previous work along this line is Sproat et al..
