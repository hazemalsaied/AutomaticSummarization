In this paper, we describe a search procedure for statistical machine translation. 
In this paper, we have presented a new, eÆcient DP-based search procedure for statistical machine translation. 
The decoding methods presented in this paper explore the partial candidate translation hypotheses greedily, as presented in Tillmann and Ney  and Och et al. 
A detailed description of the search procedure used is given in this patent. 
The complexity of the algorithm is O, where E is the size of the target language vocabulary. 
The computational complexity for the left-to-right and right-to-left is the same, O( 
A search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented. 
Skipped : The translation of up to two words may be anticipated. 
For each extension a new position is added to the coverage set. 
Starting from a DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem, we present a novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language in order to achieve an eÆcient search algorithm. 
The approach assumes that the word reordering is restricted to a few positions in the source sentence. 
Covering the first uncovered position in the source sentence, we use the language model probability p. 
We used a translation system called â€œsingle- word based approachâ€ described in. 
The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task, which is a limited-domain spoken-language task. 
2) An improved language model, which takes into account syntactic structure, e.g. to ensure that a proper English verbgroup is generated.
