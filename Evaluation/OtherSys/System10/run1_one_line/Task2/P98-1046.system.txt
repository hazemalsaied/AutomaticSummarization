We see verb classes as the key to making gen­ eralizations about regular extensions of mean­ ing.
Two current approaches to English verb classi­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).
This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.
If only one or two verbs were shared between two classes, we assumed this might be due to ho­ mophony, an idiosyncrasy involving individual verbs rather than a systematic relationship in­ volving coherent sets of verbs.
isolate semantic components Some of the large Levin classes comprise verbs that exhibit a wide range of possible semantic components, and could be divided into smaller subclasses.
The list of members for each Levin verb class is not always complete, so to check if a particular verb belongs to a class it is better to check that the verb exhibits all the alternations that de­ fine the class.
Even though the Levin verb classes are defined by their syntactic behavior, many reflect seman­ tic distinctions made by WordNet, a classifica­ tion hierarchy defined in terms of purely se­ mantic word relations (synonyms, hypernyms, etc.).
Whereas each WordNet synset is hierarchicalized accord­ ing to only one aspect (e.g., Result, in the case of cut), Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features, without designating one as primary.
