Exploring Various Knowledge in Relation Extraction
Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement.
We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance.
Finally, we present experimental setting and results in Section 5 and conclude with some general observations in relation extraction in Section 6.
The relation extraction task was formulated at the 7th Message Understanding Conference (MUC7 1998) and is starting to be addressed more and more within the natural language processing and machine learning communities.
Zhang (2004) approached relation classification by combining various lexical and syntactic features with bootstrapping on top of Support Vector Machines.
Complicated relation extraction tasks may also impose a big challenge to the modeling approach used by Miller et al (2000) which integrates various tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, template element extraction and relation extraction, in a single model.
In this paper, we only model explicit relations because of poor inter-annotator agreement in the annotation of implicit relations and their limited number.
In the future work, we will focus on exploring more semantic knowledge in relation extraction, which has not been covered by current research.
Therefore, it would be interesting to see how imperfect EDT affects the performance in relation extraction.
