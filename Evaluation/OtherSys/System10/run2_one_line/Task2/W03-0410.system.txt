In moving to a scenario of verb class discovery, using clustering, we face the problem of having a large number of irrelevant features for a particular clustering task.
In the remainder of the paper, we first briefly review our feature space and present our experimental classes and verbs.
We use the same classes and example verbs as in the supervised experiments of Joanis and Stevenson (2003) to enable a comparison between the performance of the unsupervised and supervised methods.
1 For practical reasons, as well as for enabling us to draw more general conclusions from the results, the classes also could neither be too small nor contain mostly infrequent verbs.
Because we make the simplifying assumption of a single correct classification for each verb, we also removed any verb: that was deemed excessively polysemous; that belonged to another class under consideration in our study; or for which the class did not correspond to the main sense.
As we have defined it, necessarily generally increases as the number of clusters increases, with the extreme being at the #verbs correctly classified #verbs total thus provides a measure of the usefulness in practice of a clusteringâ€”that is, if one were to use the clustering as a classification, this measure tells how accurate overall the class assignments would be.
Following Joanis and Stevenson (2003), for each class, we systematically identified the subset of features 4 These results differ slightly from those reported in Joanis and Stevenson (2003), because of our slight changes in verb sets, discussed in Section 3.2.
