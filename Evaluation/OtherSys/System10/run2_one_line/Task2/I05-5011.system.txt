We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.
The accuracy of the sets in representing paraphrase ranged from 73% to 99%, depending on the NE categories and set sizes; the accuracy of the links for two evaluated domains was 73% and 86%.
Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.
We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.
Also, we donâ€™t know how many such paraphrase sets are necessary to cover even some everyday things or events.
In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.
After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue.
If the same pair of NE instances is used with different phrases, these phrases are likely to be paraphrases.
While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system.
