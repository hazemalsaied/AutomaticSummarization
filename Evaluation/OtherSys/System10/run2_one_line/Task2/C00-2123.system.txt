Word Re-ordering and DP-based Search in Statistical Machine Translation
In this paper, we describe a search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT) based on dynamic programming (DP).
In Section 2, we brie y review our approach to statistical machine translation.
In Section 4, we present the performance measures used and give translation results on the Verbmobil task.
In this section, we brie y review our translation approach.
This algorithm can be applied to statistical machine translation.
Here, we process only full-form words within the translation procedure.
Although the ultimate goal of the Verbmobil project is the translation of spoken language, the input used for the translation experiments reported on in this paper is the (more or less) correct orthographic transcription of the spoken sentences.
An error count of 0:0 is assigned to a perfect translation, and an error count of 1:0 is assigned to a semantically and syntactically wrong translation.
For our demonstration system, we typically use the pruning threshold t0 = 5:0 to speed up the search by a factor 5 while allowing for a small degradation in translation accuracy.
In this paper, we have presented a new, e√Ücient DP-based search procedure for statistical machine translation.
Future extensions of the system might include: 1) An extended translation model, where we use more context to predict a source word.
