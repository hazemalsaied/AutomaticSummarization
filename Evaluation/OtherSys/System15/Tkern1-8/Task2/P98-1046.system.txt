It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr, 1997). In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. Whereas each WordNet synset is hierarchicalized accordÃÂ­ ing to only one aspect (e.g., Result, in the case of cut), Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features, without designating one as primary. The sets of syntactic frames associated with a particular Levin class are not intended to be arbitrary, and they are supposed to reflect unÃÂ­ derlying semantic components that constrain alÃÂ­ lowable arguments. As in English, these verbs seem to take different alterÃÂ­ nations, and the ability of each to participate in an alternation is related to its semantic content. 2.

The only escape from this limÃÂ­ itation will be through the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisiÃÂ­
