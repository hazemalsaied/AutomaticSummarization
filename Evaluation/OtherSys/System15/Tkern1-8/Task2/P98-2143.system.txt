Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7% for the genre of techÃÂ­ nical manuals and at least in this genre, the approach appears to be more successful than other similar methods. Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge. The "Baseline subject" model tested on the same data scored 33.9% recall and 67.9% precision, whereas "Baseline most recent" scored 66.7%. There might be cases where one or more of the antecedent indicators do not "point" to the correct antecedent. The sample texts conÃÂ­ tained 180 pronouns among which were 120 inÃÂ­ stances of exophoric reference (most being zero proÃÂ­ nouns). To turn on the printer, press the Power buttoni and hold iti down for a moment. Definiteness Definite noun phrases in previous sentences are more likely antecedents of pronominal anaphors than indefinite ones (definite noun phrases score 0 and indefinite ones are penalised by -1). One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledgeÃÂ­ based system, however, is that it is a very labourÃÂ­ intensive and time-consuming task. As expected, some of the preferences had to be modified in order to fit with specific features of Polish (Mitkov & Stys 1997). Here "the VCR" is penalised (-1) for being part of the prepositional phrase "into the VCR". Our evaluation, however, suggests that much less is lost than might be feared. The collocation preference here is restricted to the patterns "noun phrase (pronoun), verb" and "verb, noun phrase (pronoun)". In particular, this strategy can often override incorrect
