The "Baseline subject" model tested on the same data scored 33.9% recall and 67.9% precision, whereas "Baseline most recent" scored 66.7%. Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge. Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7% for the genre of techÃÂ­ nical manuals and at least in this genre, the approach appears to be more successful than other similar methods. One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledgeÃÂ­ based system, however, is that it is a very labourÃÂ­ intensive and time-consuming task. Top symptoms like "lexical reiteration" asÃÂ­ sign score "2" whereas "non-prepositional" noun phrases are given a negative score of "-1". Our evaluation, however, suggests that much less is lost than might be feared. Also, a sequence of noun phrases with the same head counts as lexical reiteration (e.g. "toner bottle", "bottle of toner", "the bottle"). Input is checked against agreement and for a number of antecedent indicators. There might be cases where one or more of the antecedent indicators do not "point" to the correct antecedent. The success rate of the "Baseline Subject" was 29.2%, whereas the success rate of "Baseline Most Recent NP" was 62.5%. We have described a robust, knowledge-poor apÃÂ­ proach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger. The collocation preference here is restricted to the patterns "noun phrase (pronoun), verb" and "verb, noun phrase (pronoun)".
