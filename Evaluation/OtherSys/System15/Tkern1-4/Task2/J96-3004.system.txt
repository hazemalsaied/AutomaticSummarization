Any NLP application that presumes as input unrestricted text requires an initial phase of text analysis; such applications involve problems as diverse as machine translation, information retrieval, and text-to-speech synthesis (TIS). Twentieth-century linguistic work on Chinese (Chao 1968; Li and Thompson 1981; Tang 1988,1989, inter alia) has revealed the incorrectness of this traditional view. We have provided methods for handling certain classes of unknown words, and models for other classes could be provided, as we have noted. A related point is that mutual information is helpful in augmenting existing electronic dictionaries, (cf. This latter evaluation compares the performance of the system with that of several human judges since, as we shall show, even people do not agree on a single correct way to segment a text. then define the best segmentation to be the cheapest or best path in Id(I) o D* (i.e., Id(I) composed with the transitive closure of 0).6 Consider the abstract example illustrated in Figure 2. The segmenter handles the grouping of hanzi into words and outputs word pronunciations, with default pronunciations for hanzi it cannot group; we focus here primarily on the system's ability to segment text appropriately (rather than on its pronunciation abilities). Mutual information was shown to be useful in the segmentation task given that one does not have a dictionary. For example, as Gan (1994) has noted, one can construct examples where the segmenÃÂ­ tation is locally ambiguous but can be determined on the basis of sentential or even discourse context. The first
