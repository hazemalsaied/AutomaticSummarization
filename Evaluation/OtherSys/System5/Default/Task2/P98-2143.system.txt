The algorithm with the next-to-highest results in (Char- niak and Elsner, 2009) is MARS (Mitkov, 1998) from the GuiTAR (Poesio and Kabadjov, 2004) toolkit.
Mitkovâ€™s algorithm operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as â€\x9dantecedent indicatorsâ€\x9d).
Mitkov showed that a salience-based approach can be applied across genres and without complex syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis (Mitkov, 1998).
Many hand-tested corpus evaluations have been done in the past (e.g., Walker 1989; Strube 1998; Mitkov 1998; Strube and Hahn 1999), but these have the drawback of being carried out on small corpora.
A lot of work has been done in English for the purpose of anaphora resolution and various
Most of the indicators have been adopted in LINGUA without modification from the original English version (see (Mitkov, 1998) for more details).
To turn on the printer, press the Power buttoni and hold iti down for a moment.
The approach being robust (an attempt is made to resolve each anaphor and a pro­ posed antecedent is returned), this figure represents both precision and recall if we use the MUC terminology.		
For in­ stance, in the sentence Insert the cassette into the VCRi making sure iti is turned on, the indicator non-prepositional noun phrases would penalise the correct antecedent.		
The success rate of the Baseline Subject was 29.2%, whereas the success rate of Baseline Most Recent NP was 62.5%.
