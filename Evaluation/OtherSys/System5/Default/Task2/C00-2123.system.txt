This article will present a DP-based beam search decoder for the IBM4 translation model.
They were usually incorporated in the EM algorithm (Brown et al., 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Tillmann and Ney, 2000; Och et al., 2000).
Under this constraint, many researchers had contributed algorithms and associated pruning strategies, such as Berger et al.
To summarize these experimental tests, we briefly report experimental offline results for the following translation approachesâ€¢ single-word based approach [20];
Some of these studies have concentrated on finite-state or extended finite-state machinery, such as (Vilar and others, 1999), others have chosen models closer to context-free grammars and context-free transduction, such as (Alshawi et al., 2000; Watanabe et al., 2000; Yamamoto and Matsumoto, 2000), and yet other studies cannot be comfortably assigned to either of these two frameworks, such as (Brown and others, 1990) and (Tillmann and Ney, 2000).
This algorithm can be applied to statistical machine translation.

In order to handle the necessary word reordering as an optimization problem within our dynamic programming approach, we describe a solution to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) which is based on dynamic programming (Held, Karp, 1962).
