<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userÃ¢â¬â¢s query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userÃ¢â¬â¢s question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Here, an NE instance pair is any pair of NEs separated by at most 4 syntactic chunks; for example, Ã¢â¬ÅIBM plans to acquire LotusÃ¢â¬?.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The data is sorted based on the frequency of the context (Ã¢â¬Åa unit ofÃ¢â¬? appeared 314 times in the corpus) and the NE pair instances appearing with that context are shown with their frequency (e.g. Ã¢â¬ÅNBCÃ¢â¬? and Ã¢â¬ÅGeneral Electric Co.Ã¢â¬? appeared 10 times with the context Ã¢â¬Åa unit ofÃ¢â¬?).</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Step 3.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We then gather all phrases with the same keyword.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>x EG, has agreed to be bought by H x EG, now owned by H x H to acquire EG x HÃ¢â¬â¢s agreement to buy EG Three of those phrases are actually paraphrases, but sometime there could be some noise; such as the second phrase above.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>x EG, has agreed to be bought by H x EG, now owned by H x H to acquire EG x HÃ¢â¬â¢s agreement to buy EG Three of those phrases are actually paraphrases, but sometime there could be some noise; such as the second phrase above.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For example, in the CC-domain, 96 keywords are found which have TF/ITF scores above a threshold; some of them are shown in Figure 3.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Eight out of the thirteen errors in the high frequency phrases in the CC-domain are the phrases in Ã¢â¬ÅagreeÃ¢â¬?.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For example, from the sentence Ã¢â¬ÅMr.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The similar explanation applies to the link to the Ã¢â¬ÅstakeÃ¢â¬? set.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Instead, we focused on phrases and set the frequency threshold to 2, and so were able to utilize a lot of phrases while minimizing noise.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>There has also been work using a bootstrap- ping approach [Brin 98; Agichtein and Gravano 00; Ravichandran and Hovy 02].</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>There has also been work using a bootstrap- ping approach [Brin 98; Agichtein and Gravano 00; Ravichandran and Hovy 02].</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>There has also been work using a bootstrap- ping approach [Brin 98; Agichtein and Gravano 00; Ravichandran and Hovy 02].</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>One possibility is to use n-grams based on mutual information.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Also, Ã¢â¬ÅagreeÃ¢â¬? in the CC-domain is not a desirable keyword.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Ã¢â¬ÅAgreeÃ¢â¬? is a subject control verb, which dominates another verb whose subject is the same as that of Ã¢â¬ÅagreeÃ¢â¬?; the latter verb is generally the one of interest for extraction.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Using structural information As was explained in the results section, we extracted examples like Ã¢â¬ÅSmith estimates LotusÃ¢â¬?, from a sentence like Ã¢â¬ÅMr.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Using structural information As was explained in the results section, we extracted examples like Ã¢â¬ÅSmith estimates LotusÃ¢â¬?, from a sentence like Ã¢â¬ÅMr.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Smith estimates Lotus will make profit this quarterÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬?.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Smith estimates Lotus will make profit this quarterÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬?.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>In order to solve this problem, a parse tree is needed to understand that Ã¢â¬ÅLotusÃ¢â¬? is not the object of Ã¢â¬ÅestimatesÃ¢â¬?.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>The phrases have to be the expressions of length less than 5 chunks, appear between two NEs.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Also, the method of using keywords rules out phrases which donÃ¢â¬â¢t contain popular words in the domain.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>The discovered paraphrases can be a big help to reduce human labor and create a more comprehensive pattern set.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.</a></body>
