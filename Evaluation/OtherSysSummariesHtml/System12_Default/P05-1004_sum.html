<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Ciaramita (2002) has produced a mini- WORDNET by manually reducing the WORDNET hierarchy to 106 broad categories.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Supersense tagging can provide automated or semi- automated assistance to lexicographers adding words to the WORDNET hierarchy.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We have developed a 2 billion word corpus, shallow- parsed with a statistical NLP pipeline, which is by far the Table 2 Example nouns and their supersenses largest NLP processed corpus described in published re search.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The corpus consists of the British National Corpus (BNC), the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1), and most of the Linguistic Data ConsortiumÃ¢â¬â¢s news text collected since 1987 Continuous Speech Recognition III (CSRIII); North American News Text Corpus (NANTC); the NANTC Supplement (NANTS); and the ACQUAINT Corpus.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This consists of five passes over each sentence that first identify noun and verb phrase heads and p(w, r, wt ) Ã¢Ëâ p(Ã¢Ëâ, r, wt )p(w, Ã¢Ëâ, Ã¢Ëâ) p(Ã¢Ëâ, r, wt )p(w, Ã¢Ëâ, Ã¢Ëâ) (2) then collect grammatical relations between each common noun and its modifiers and verbs.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The only similar performing tool is the Trigrams Ã¢â¬ËnÃ¢â¬â¢ Tags tagger (Brants, 2000) which uses a much simpler statistical model.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If the head verb is a form of be then the VP becomes attributive.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The interaction between the head verb and the preposition determine whether the noun is an indirect object of a ditransitive verb or alternatively the head of a PP that is modifying the verb.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>However, sometimes the unknown noun does not appear in our 2 billion word corpus, or at least does not appear frequently enough to provide sufficient contextual information to extract reliable synonyms.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>We have experimented with up to 200 voting extracted synonyms.</a></body>
