<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâ€™s query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâ€™s question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.2020</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.4016</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For each pair we also record the context, i.e. the phrase between the two NEs (Step1).306</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Hereafter, each pair of NE categories will be called a domain; e.g. the “Company – Company” domain, which we will call CC- domain (Step 2).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For each domain, phrases which contain the same keyword are gathered to build a set of phrases (Step 3).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Extract NE instance pairs with contexts First, we extract NE pair instances with their context from the corpus.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [Sekine et al. 2004].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>These 140 NE categories are designed by extending MUC’s 7 NE categories with finer sub-categories (such as Company, Institute, and Political Party for Organization; and Country, Province, and City for Location) and adding some new types of NE categories (Position Title, Product, Event, and Natural Object).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword.6541</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Here a set is represented by the keyword and the number in parentheses indicates the number of shared NE pair instances.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.</S</a></body>
