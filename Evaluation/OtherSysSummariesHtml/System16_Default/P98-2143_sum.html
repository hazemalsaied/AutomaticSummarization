<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semanÂ­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for realÂ­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowlÂ­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.</a>

<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semanÂ­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for realÂ­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowlÂ­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÂ­ maining candidates (see next section).</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>If this does not help, the candidate with the higher score for indicating verbs is preferred.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Immediate reference In technical manuals the "immediate reference" clue can often be useful in identifying the antecedent.</a>

<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>For practical reasons, the approach presented does not incorporate syntactic and semantic information (other than a list of domain terms) and it is not realÂ­ istic to expect its performance to be as good as an approach which makes use of syntactic and semantic knowledge in terms of constraints and preferences.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>There were 71 pronouns in the 140 page technical manual; 7 of the pronouns were non-anaphoric and 16 exophoric.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>The success rate of the "Baseline Subject" was 29.2%, whereas the success rate of "Baseline Most Recent NP" was 62.5%.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>The reason is that both our approach and Breck Baldwin's approach share common principles (both are knowledge-poor and use a POS tagger to provide the input) and therefore a comparison would be appropriate.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Our evaluaÂ­ tion, based on 63 examples (anaphors) from a techÂ­ nical manual (Sony 1992), indicates a success rate of 95.2% (and critical success rate 89.3 %).</a>
