<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There has been a lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If the expression is longer or complicated (like âA buys Bâ and âAâs purchase of Bâ), it is called âparaphraseâ, i.e. a set of phrases which express the same thing or event.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.</a>

<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>However, there are phrases which express the same meanings even though they do not share the same keyword.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>It is natural that the larger the data in the domain, the more keywords are found.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.</a></body>
