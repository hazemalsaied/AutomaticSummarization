<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Figure 2 Intersective class formed from Levin carry, push/pull and split verbs- verbs in() are not listed by Levin in all the intersecting classes but participate in all the alternations The intersection between the push/pull verbs of exerting force, the carry verbs and the split verbs illustrates how the force semantic compoÂ­ nent of a verb can also be used to extend its meaning so that one can infer a causation of accompanied motion.</a>

<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>When a roll verb occurs in the tranÂ­ sitive (Bill moved the box across the room), the subject physically causes the object to move, whereas the subject of a transitive run verb merely induces the object to move (the coach ran the athlete around the track).</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Verbs in the slide/roll/run intersecÂ­ tion are also allowed to appear in the dative alternation (Carla slid the book to Dale, Carla slid Dale the book), in which the sense of change of location is extended to change of possession.When used intransitively with a path prepo sitional phrase, some of the manner of motion verbs can take on a sense of pseudo-motional existence, in which the subject does not actuÂ­ ally move, but has a shape that could describe a path for the verb (e.g., The stream twists through the valley).</a>
