<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Even though the Levin verb classes are defined by their syntactic behavior, many reflect semanÂ­ tic distinctions made by WordNet, a classificaÂ­ tion hierarchy defined in terms of purely seÂ­ mantic word relations (synonyms, hypernyms, etc.).</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Whereas each WordNet synset is hierarchicalized accordÂ­ ing to only one aspect (e.g., Result, in the case of cut), Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features, without designating one as primary.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Intersective Levin sets partition these classes according to more coÂ­ herent subsets of features (force, force+motion, force+separation), in effect highlighting a lattice of semantic features that determine the sense of a verb.</a>

<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>We expect these cross-linguistic features to be useful for capturing translation generalizations between languages as discussed in the literaÂ­ ture (Palmer and Rosenzweig, 1996), (CopesÂ­ take and Sanfilippo, 1993), (Dorr, 1997).</a>
