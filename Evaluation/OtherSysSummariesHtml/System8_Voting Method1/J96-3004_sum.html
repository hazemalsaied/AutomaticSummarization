<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>Roughly speaking, previous work can be divided into three categories, namely purely statistical approaches, purely lexiÂ­ cal rule-based approaches, and approaches that combine lexical information with staÂ­ tistical information.</a>

<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50>The most popular approach to dealing with segÂ­ mentation ambiguities is the maximum matching method, possibly augmented with further heuristics.</a>
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51>This method, one instance of which we term the "greedy algorithm" in our evaluation of our own system in Section 5, involves starting at the beginning (or end) of the sentence, finding the longest word starting (ending) at that point, and then repeating the process starting at the next (previous) hanzi until the end (beginÂ­ ning) of the sentence is reached.</a>

<a name="106">[106]</a> <a href="#106" id=106>This implies, therefore, that a major factor in the performance of a Chinese segmenter is the quality of the base dictionary, and this is probably a more important factor-from the point of view of performance alone-than the particular computational methods used.</a>
<a name="107">[107]</a> <a href="#107" id=107>The use of weighted transducers in particular has the attractive property that the model, as it stands, can be straightforwardly interfaced to other modules of a larger speech or natural language system presumably one does not want to segment Chinese text for its own sake but instead with a larger purpose in mind.</a>
<a name="108">[108]</a> <a href="#108" id=108>Furthermore, by inverting the transducer so that it maps from phonemic transcriptions to hanzi sequences, one can apply the segmenter to other problems, such as speech recognition (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994).</a></body>
