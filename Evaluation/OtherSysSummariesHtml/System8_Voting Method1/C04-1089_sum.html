<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we present a new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations, although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations, although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations, although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations, although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>When translating a word w, two sources of information can be used to determine its translation the word w itself and the surrounding words in the neighborhood (i.e., the context) of w. Most previous research only considers one of the two sources of information, but not both.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For example, the work of (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002a; AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Finally, the English candidate word with the smallest average rank position and that appears within the top M positions of both ranked lists is the chosen English translation (as described in Section 2).</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The work that is most similar to ours is the recent research of (Huang et al., 2004).</a></body>
