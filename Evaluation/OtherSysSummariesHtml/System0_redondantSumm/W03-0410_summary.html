<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We have previously shown that a broad set of 220 noisy features performs well in supervised verb classification ( Joanis and Stevenson , 2003 ) . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This confirms that appropriate feature selection , and not just a small number of features , is important for the task of verb class discovery . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Here we briefly describe the features that comprise our feature space , and refer the interested reader to Joanis and Stevenson ( 2003 ) for details . </a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Here we briefly describe the features that comprise our feature space , and refer the interested reader to Joanis and Stevenson ( 2003 ) for details . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We then describe our clustering methodology , the measures we use to evaluate a clustering , and our experimental results . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Here we briefly describe the features that comprise our feature space , and refer the interested reader to Joanis and Stevenson ( 2003 ) for details . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>For example , the accuracy measure ( Stevenson and Joanis 2003 ; Korhonen , Krymolowski , and Marx 2003 ) evaluates whether a verb is assigned to a correct cluster with respect to the gold standard class of the majority of cluster members . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>In recent work , Stevenson and Joanis ( 2003 ) compared their supervised method for verb classification with supervised and unsupervised techniques . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>We have previously shown that a broad set of 220 noisy features performs well in supervised verb classification ( Joanis and Stevenson , 2003 ) . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>We use the same classes and example verbs as in the supervised experiments of Joanis and Stevenson ( 2003 ) to enable a comparison between the performance of the unsupervised and supervised methods . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>In recent work , Stevenson and Joanis ( 2003 ) compared their supervised method for verb classification with supervised and unsupervised techniques . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>In these experiments , they enlarged the number of gold standard English verb classes to 14 classes related to Levin classes , with a total of 841 verbs . </a>

<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>In recent work , Stevenson and Joanis ( 2003 ) compared their supervised method for verb classification with supervised and unsupervised techniques . </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>A plausible scenario is that researchers would have examples of verbs which they believe fall into different classes of interest , and they want to separate other verbs along the same lines . </a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Because we make the simplifying assumption of a single correct classification for each verb , we also removed any verb : that was deemed excessively polygamous that belonged to another class under consideration in our study ; or for which the class did not correspond to the main sense . </a>

<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>They found that a supervised approach where the classifier was trained with five seed verbs from each verb class outperformed both a manual selection of features and the unsupervised 186 approach of Dash , Liu , and Yao ( 1997 ) , which used an entropy measure to organize data into a multidimensional space . </a>

<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>We use , the mean of the silhouette measure from Matlab , which measures how distant a data point is from other clusters . </a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Because we make the simplifying assumption of a single correct classification for each verb , we also removed any verb : that was deemed excessively polygamous that belonged to another class under consideration in our study ; or for which the class did not correspond to the main sense . </a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>We focus here on extending the applicability of unsupervised methods , as in ( Schulte im Walde and Brew , 2002 ; Stevenson and Merlo , 1999 ) , to the lexical semantic classification of verbs . </a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Here we briefly describe the features that comprise our feature space , and refer the interested reader to Joanis and Stevenson ( 2003 ) for details . </a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Our second measure , the adjusted Rand measure used by Schulte im Walde ( 2003 ) , instead gives a measure of how consistent the given clustering is overall with respect to the gold standard classification . </a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>We then replaced 10 of the 260 verbs ( 4 % ) to enable us to have representative seed verbs for certain classes in our semi-supervised experiments ( e.g. , so that we could include wipe as a seed verb for the Wipe verbs , and fill for the Fill verbs ) . </a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>However , a general feature space means that most features will be irrelevant to any given verb discrimination task . </a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>Unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches have been successful as well , but have tended to be more restrictive , in relying on human filtering of the results ( Riloff and Schmelzenbach , 1998 ) , on the hand- selection of features ( Stevenson and Merlo , 1999 ) , or on the use of an extensive grammar ( Schulte im Walde and Brew , 2002 ) . </a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>Because we make the simplifying assumption of a single correct classification for each verb , we also removed any verb : that was deemed excessively polygamous that belonged to another class under consideration in our study ; or for which the class did not correspond to the main sense . </a>

<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>However , it gives important information about the quality of a clustering : The other measures being equal , a clustering with a higher value indicates tighter and more separated clusters , suggesting stronger inherent patterns in the data . </a>
