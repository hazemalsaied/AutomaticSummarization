<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Carmita and Johnson ( 2003 ) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every 8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An additional potential is to integrate automatically acquired relationships with the information found in WordNet , which seems to suffer from several serious limitations ( Curran 2005 ) , and typically overlaps to a rather limited extent with the output of automatic acquisition methods . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Technical domains , such as medicine , require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings , and a significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This technique is similar to Hearst and SchuÂ¨ tze ( 1993 ) and Widdows ( 2003 ) . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However , sometimes the unknown noun does not appear in our 2 billion word corpus , or at least does not appear frequently enough to provide sufficient contextual information to extract reliable synonyms . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Superdense tagging assigns unknown nouns one of 26 broad semantic categories used by lexicographers to organize their manual insertion into WORDNET . </a>
