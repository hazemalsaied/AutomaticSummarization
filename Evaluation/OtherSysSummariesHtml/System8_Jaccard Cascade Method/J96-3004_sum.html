<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Most languages that use Roman, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, or Semitic scripts, and many that use Indian-derived scripts, mark orthographic word boundaries; however, languages written in a Chinese-derived writÂ­ ing system, including Chinese and Japanese, as well as Indian-derived writing systems of languages like Thai, do not delimit orthographic words.1 Put another way, written Chinese simply lacks orthographic words.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>All notions of word, with the exception of the orthographic word, are as relevant in Chinese as they are in English, and just as is the case in other languages, a word in Chinese may correspond to one or more symbols in the orthog 1 For a related approach to the problem of word-segrnention in Japanese, see Nagata (1994), inter alia..</a>

<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Making the reasonable assumption that similar information is relevant for solving these problems in Chinese, it follows that a prerequisite for intonation-boundary assignment and prominence assignment is word segmentation.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The points enumerated above are particularly related to ITS, but analogous arguments can easily be given for other applications; see for example Wu and Tseng's (1993) discussion of the role of segmentation in information retrieval.</a>

<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51>The simplest approach involves scoring the various analyses by costs based on word frequency, and picking the lowest cost path; variants of this approach have been described in Chang, Chen, and Chen (1991) and Chang and Chen (1993).</a>

<a name="62">[62]</a> <a href="#62" id=62>However, it is almost universally the case that no clear definition of what constitutes a "correct" segmentation is given, so these performance measures are hard to evaluate.</a>
<a name="63">[63]</a> <a href="#63" id=63>The major problem for all segmentation systems remains the coverage afforded by the dictionary and the lexical rules used to augment the dictionary to deal with unseen words.</a>
<a name="64">[64]</a> <a href="#64" id=64>The dictionary sizes reported in the literature range from 17,000 to 125,000 entries, and it seems reasonable to assume that the coverage of the base dictionary constitutes a major factor in the performance of the various approaches, possibly more important than the particular set of methods used in the segmentation.</a>
<a name="65">[65]</a> <a href="#65" id=65>Furthermore, even the size of the dictionary per se is less important than the appropriateness of the lexicon to a particular test corpus as Fung and Wu (1994) have shown, one can obtain substantially better segmentation by tailoring the lexicon to the corpus to be segmented.</a>
