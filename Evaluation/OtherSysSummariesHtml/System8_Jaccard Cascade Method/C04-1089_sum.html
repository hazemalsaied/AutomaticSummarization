<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For example, the work of (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002a; AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>â t c t ! t The candidate ei that is ranked the highest according to the average rank is taken to be the cor where t is a term in the corpus, ct is the number rect translation and is output.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>So we first segmented Chinese text with a Chinese word segmenter that was based on maximum entropy modeling (Ng and Low, 2004).</a>
