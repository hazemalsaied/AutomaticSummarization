Piccard and Jones spent a final night flying across Africa before landing in the Sahara some 300 miles south of Cairo.
They had spent almost three weeks in the balloon and had traveled almost 30,000 miles, then had to wait seven hours for an Egyptian helicopter to fetch them.
The International Olympic Committee was to award the Olympic Order to the two balloonists and the balloon was to be permanently housed at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum.
The two men also received a $1 million prize from the Anheuser-Busch Corporation, half of which was to be donated to charity.
