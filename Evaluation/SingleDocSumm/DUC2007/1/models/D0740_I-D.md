After 19 days, 21 hours and 47 minutes aloft, the Swiss-British balloonist team of Piccard and Jones landed early on March 21 in the Saharan sands of southern Egypt.
Unfavorable winds prevented their hoped-for landing near the Pyramids.
They crossed the 9 degrees longitude finish line the day before, setting a record for the first nonstop hot-air balloon circumnavigation of the globe.
For their feat, Anheuser-Busch Corporation awarded the balloonists a cup and $1million prize money, some of which they will use to start the Winds of Hope Foundation charity.
The International Olympic Committee will award them the Olympic Order.
