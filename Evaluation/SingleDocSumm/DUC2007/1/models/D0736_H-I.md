"Queen" Oprah extends the fantasy of bestowing fortunes on ordinary citizens.
She bestows gifts of food, CDs, and Palm Pilots on her audiences, and opportunities for self-enhancement and self-discipline to all her fans.
Sensible psychologist Dr. Phillip C. McGraw and spiritual advice giver Gary Zukav appear on Oprah's show, introduced as her personal counselors.
Her cook and members of her book club appear too.
Al Gore and George W. Bush both appeared on Oprah's show to attract more women's votes.
Gore said he would ask the entertainment industry to voluntarily stop marketing inappropriate movies, video games and music to children.
