Oprah Winfrey's new magazine, "O," is scheduled to go on sale April 2000.
Meanwhile, a lawsuit accuses Oprah of using copyrighted pictures in her best-selling book.
Oprah claims she paid photographers for license to use the pictures anywhere she wants.
The counterclaim says she can use them for publicity packages for her talk show, but not the book.
The TV movie, "Oprah Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays with Morrie," was honored as best TV movie.
Jack Lemmon and co-star Hank Azaria received Emmys for their roles in the movie.
Seeking women's votes, Al Gore and George Bush appeared separately on Oprah's show.
