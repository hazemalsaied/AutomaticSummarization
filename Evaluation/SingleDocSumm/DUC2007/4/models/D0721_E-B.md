In November 1999 McKinney was barred from using a "gay panic" defense, that latent gays would react violently to homosexual propositioning, amounting to "temporary insanity" or "diminished capacity" defenses that are not within Wyoming law.
McKinney was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences for murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery.
In July Congress did not pass legislation to outlaw bias crimes against gender, sexual orientation or disabilities.
In June 2000 a new Senate amendment would add sexual orientation, sex or disability to 1968 federal hate crimes law, while exercising federally protected rights, such as voting, if local authorities do not prosecute.
