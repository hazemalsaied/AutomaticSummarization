The Newt and Marianne divorce proceedings entered a new phase when the couple was ordered to appear for a court-ordered mediation session in Georgia.
The mediator spent 12 hours negotiating a settlement agreement between the couple which led to a "full settlement".
The agreement details how they will split property, money and other assets.
Cobb Count y, Georgia, Judge Robinson made the divorce final and agreed to seal the agreement.
That spared Newt and Marianne embarrassment that could have resulted from a public trial.
A month later, Gingrich announced that he would marry Callista Bisek in Alexandria.
