Bisek and Newt Gingrich's associates never had to sit for a deposition with Marianne Gingrich's lawyers.
After Marianne and Newt appeared for mandatory mediation it was announced on Dec. 16 that the two had reached a "full settlement".
The final divorce settlement was signed on April 3, 2000 and a judge was asked to seal the agreement keeping it out of the public court file so its terms were likely to remain secret.
One issue was settled and announced: Newt and Callista Bisek were scheduled to be married on Aug. 18, 2000.
