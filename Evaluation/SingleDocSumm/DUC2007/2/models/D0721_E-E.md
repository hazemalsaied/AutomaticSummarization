The presiding judge, Barton Voight, at Aaron McKinney's murder trial barred McKinney's attorneys from using a "gay panic" defense.
This defense maintains that an attacker, stirred by fears he himself is gay, will have a violent reaction to a perceived homosexual advance.
Voight ruled this argument was not allowed by Wyoming law.
The jury found McKinney guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life imprisonment in a deal approved by Shepard'ns parents.
Shepard's father appeared in a press conference in front of the US Capital urging Congress to pass legislation that would extend hate-crime protection to gays and lesbians.
