Gore opened his new campaign headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee, in October 1999.
Gore said the move was intended to get the attention of average voters.
Gore officials acknowledged that Gore's campaign needed rehabilitation in the face of the stronger than expected challenge of former Senator Bill Bradley, who caught up with Gore in poll numbers and fund-raising.
Senator Edward Kennedy endorsed Gore; the Gore campaign hoped this endorsement would help Gore with voters in New Hampshire.
Gore planned visits to Washington state, Colorado, Arizona, Georgia, New York, Massachusetts, Ohio, and California.
He chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his running mate.
