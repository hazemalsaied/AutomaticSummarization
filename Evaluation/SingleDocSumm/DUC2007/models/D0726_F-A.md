At the dawn of 1999 Al Gore formed a campaign organization for the 2000 Presidential campaign.
Headquarters opened in Washington in February.
Facing criticism of his all-male inner circle, Gore appointed a veteran female strategist as his deputy Campaign Manager and two black women as Finance Chairman and Political Director.
Endorsed by Minority Leader Gephardt, Gore had only Sen. Bill Bradley as an announced opponent.
Polls showed Gore the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination, but a distinct underdog when pitted against potential Republican candidate George W. Bush.
By April 1999 the Gore campaign had raised $8.9 million.
