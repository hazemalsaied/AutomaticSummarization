Newt Gingrich filed for divorce from his wife Marianne on July 29, 1999.
Marianne filed a counterclaim asking a judge to freeze the couple's assets, accusing Newt of transferring assets before filing for divorce.
Newt denied the accusation and a confidential financial agreement was reached on September 10.
When a judge granted Marianne's request for a videotaped deposition of 33-year-old Callista Bisek with whom Newt was alleged to have had an affair, Bisek asked another judge to overrule the decision.
Marianne asked permission to depose Newt's close advisors and associates complaining that he was refusing to answer pertinent questions.
