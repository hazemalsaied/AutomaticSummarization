After a decade of opposing new uranium mines, the Australian government approved construction of the Jabiluka mine in the Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List.
Environmentalists and opposition parties condemned the decision because of Kakadu's environmental and cultural value.
Aboriginal landowners threatened to block mine development.
Owners of the Jabiluka lease opposed the mine, but they are bound by a 1983 contract.
Protestors campaigned against the mine development and 350 protestors were arrested.
A week after mine construction began UNESCO's World Heritage Bureau began an investigation of claims that the area was under threat.
