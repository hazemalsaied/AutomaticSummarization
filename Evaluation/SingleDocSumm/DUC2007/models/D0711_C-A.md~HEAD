The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced an ongoing antitrust investigation of Microsoft in September 1996.
In May 1998 Microsoft held settlement talks with the DOJ, but a major antitrust trial opened on October 19, 1998.
Microsoft was accused of bullying competitors and a pattern of illegal practices intended to protect and extend its tight grip on the market.
By October 1999 the DOJ figured its cost for proceedings against Microsoft over the past decade as $13.3 million.
The first part of a two-part verdict in the antitrust case was forecast for the next month.
