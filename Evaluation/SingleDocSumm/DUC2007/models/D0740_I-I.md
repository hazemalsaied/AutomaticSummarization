Bertrand Piccard and Wim Verstraeten attempted the first balloon circumnavigation of the earth in January 1997 aboard the Breitling Orbiter, leaving from Lake Geneva.
They abandoned the attempt after six hours when fuel leaked into the cabin.
Piccard, Verstraeten, and Andy Elson tried again in January 1998 aboard Breitling Orbiter II.
They were aloft a record 9 days, 17 hrs and 55 minutes when China refused them entry and they missed the needed jet-stream winds.
Piccard and Brian Jones made a third attempt aboard the Breitling Orbiter III.
They crossed the Sahara in March 1999 moving steadily behind a rival.
