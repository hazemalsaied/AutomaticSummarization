Winfrey was unavailable for comment today because she is taping her show in the Bahamas this week, said Jerilyn Schultz, a publicist in Chicago.
Schultz said she could not comment beyond a statement issued Monday, which said no announcements were planned on whether Winfrey would continue the show after the end of her current contract.
"I Know This Much Is True" shot to No. 1 on the bestseller lists soon after Lamb's recent appearance on Oprah's show.
