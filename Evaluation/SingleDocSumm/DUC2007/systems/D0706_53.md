Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi offered Thursday to end her road side standoff with the military government if the government agrees to release jailed members of her political party.
The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
Exiled dissidents from Myanmar urged Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Friday to reschedule a trip to Myanmar by his top general because it will coincide with the anniversary of the military government's takeover.
The SLORC which took over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as a primary threat.
