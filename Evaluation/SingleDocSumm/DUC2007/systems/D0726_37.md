Thomas E. Patterson, a presidential campaign scholar at Harvard, says Gore has to distinguish himself from Clinton with considerable delicacy to avoid appearing disloyal.
Kathy Sullivan, incoming chairwoman of Democratic Party in New Hampshire, state planning to hold nation's first presidential primary in 2000, warned that Democrats in New Hampshire aren't looking for Gore to condemn Clinton.
Gore's delicate balancing act between loyalty and independence recalls challenges faced by Vice President George Bush as he prepared to launch his 1988 campaign to succeed Ronald Reagan and Vice President Hubert Humphrey as he sought to succeed Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968.
