WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and a congressional aide named in his divorce case are trying to keep lawyers for Gingrich's wife from finding out details of their relationship.
In the latest twist in the Gingriches' bitter divorce fight, lawyers for Marianne Gingrich charged in court papers Monday that Gingrich ``willfully failed and refused to answer virtually each and every interrogatory concerning his personal and professional relationships as well as the finances of his marriage''.
