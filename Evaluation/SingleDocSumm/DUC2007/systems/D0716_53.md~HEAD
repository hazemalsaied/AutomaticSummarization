The opening of Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade continues to inch closer, despite the latest vow Wednesday by Aboriginal landowners to block the development.
A fourth uranium mine could be approved within a year after Energy Resources Australia(ERA) company moved to fast-track for the Jabiluka mine in Kakadu National Park.
The Age Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of the huge Jabiluka uranium mine in the country's vast Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, after the federal government approved the mining plan for the Jabilika mine yesterday.
