The Age -- Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of huge Jabiluka uranium mine in country's vast Kakadu National Park, which is on World Heritage List, after federal government approved mining plan for Jabilika mine yesterday.
Resources Minister Warwick Parer said estimates indicated Jabiluka mine contains about 19.5 million tons of ore, which could provide more than 90,400 tons of uranium oxide.
"Jabiluka means Australia could become leading world uranium oxide supplier," Parer said in a statement.
