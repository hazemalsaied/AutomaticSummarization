Construction of the Jabiluka mine Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade began in June, after a protracted legal battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing environmental protest.
A fourth uranium mine could be approved within a year after Energy Resources Australia ( ERA ) company moved to fast-track for the Jabiluka mine in Kakadu National Park.
It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion ( Australian dollars 6.2 billion ) to Australia's gross domestic product over an about 30-year mine life, and boost the country's share of the world uranium market.
