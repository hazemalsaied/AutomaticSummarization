Court papers filed in Marietta, Ga., where the Gingriches lived, show that Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers posed 32 sets of questions to Gingrich, including one about sexual relationships with other women.
The former 10-term congressman from Marietta, Ga., also submitted a 1987 separation agreement that paid Marianne Gingrich $12,000 in alimony over six months, and divided the couple's bank accounts, furniture and cars.
The separation agreement called for Mrs. Gingrich to get $2,000 a month for six months, control over money market and checking accounts and the couple's 1984 Ford Thunderbird.
