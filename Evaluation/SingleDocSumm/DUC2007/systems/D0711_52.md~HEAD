Microsoft Corp., whose business practices are being challenged by the government in a major antitrust case, suffered a legal setback on another front Tuesday when a federal judge in California ordered the company to stop shipping Internet software that violates its contract with a rival, Sun Microsystems Inc.
Much of the detailed, company-by-company information on the prices to makers for Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system was submitted in previous testimony.
Antitrust experts said that most countries still investigating Microsoft's practices were taking a wait-and-see stance toward the company, pending the outcome of the major U.S. antitrust case.
