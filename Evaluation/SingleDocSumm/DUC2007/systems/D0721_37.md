The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, April 6: Russell Henderson's decision to plead guilty to kidnapping and murder of Matthew Shepard is little consolation to Shepard family, but it provides an appropriately severe sentence for one whose apparent anti-gay hatred led him to destroy a young life.
``Aaron McKinney, he pulled out a gun and told Matthew Shepard to give him his wallet,'' continued Henderson, who said that while he drove his friend beat Shepard.
The stress on Shepard family was so great, she continued, that within a month of Matthew's funeral, his paternal grandfather died.
