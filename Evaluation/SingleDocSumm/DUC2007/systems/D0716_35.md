CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Police arrested more than 100 protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern Territory.
The 112 were among 130 who entered a machinery compound at dawn, according to a statement issued by the protesters.
Of these 130, 20 ``locked on'' to machinery in the compound.
The protesters, who have been campaigning at the site since March, want development of the Jabiluka mine stopped.
The arrests Tuesday bring the total since the protest action began to about 350.
