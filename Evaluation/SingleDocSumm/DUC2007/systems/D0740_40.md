Bertrand Piccard and his new teammate, Tony Brown, said they will be ready later this month for a new attempt to fly nonstop round the world.
Three Europeans set off Wednesday from Switzerland in the latest quest to circle the world non-stop in a balloon.
A Swiss, Belgium and British team aiming to set a round-the-world ballooning record have delayed their start by 24 hours to Friday to take advantage of more favourable winds.
A Swiss and a Belgium were forced to abandon their attempt to tour around the world without stop by balloon six hours after they took off.
