-- A fourth uranium mine could be approved within a year after Energy Resources Australia (ERA) company moved to fast-track for the Jabiluka mine in Kakadu National Park.
The Australian government today gave the green light to the country's controversial uranium mining plan, arguing that it would generate billions of U.S. dollars in revenue for Australians and create 2,000 jobs.
The planned Jabiluka mine is on the edge of the 22,000 square-kilometer Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, in northern Australia's Northern Territory.
