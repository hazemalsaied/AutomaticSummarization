Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has reached an agreement with his wife on how to divide their assets as part of their divorce proceedings.
By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches not only end their 18-year marriage, but also avoid answering specific charges they've made against each other since Newt Gingrich filed for the divorce in July.
Divorce lawyers for Newt Gingrich's wife have subpoenaed cards, e-mail, phone records and other documents from a woman who has been romantically linked to the former House speaker.
