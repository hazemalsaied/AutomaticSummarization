Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain, departed from Chateau d'Oex, in western Switzerland, aboard Breitling Orbiter II It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop.
Piccard's last round-the-world bid was abandoned after China refused his balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over the Pacific.
Four other teams, including a combination of Virgin boss Richard Branson and Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, are also planning bids for the record.
