Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the fault line that ruptured in Turkey Tuesday, producing a devastating earthquake, had been identified more than two years ago as a particularly dangerous one.
IZMIT, Turkey - From the streets to government offices, earthquake relief workers and international agencies Friday pleaded with Turkey to turn its attention from the more than 10,000 dead and 35,000 missing from Tuesday's disaster to the hundreds of thousands of survivors left homeless, many at risk of disease.
Figures available Saturday on the earthquake that struck Turkey early Tuesday.
