The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
The company wants to truck uranium ore from Jabiluka to its existing mine and plant at Ranger, about 13 miles (20 kms) away, for processing.
Construction of the Jabiluka mine Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade began in June, after a protracted legal battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing environmental protest.
Police arrested more than 100 protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern Territory.
