Polls asking voters about a hypothetical race show Gore trailing two undeclared Republican presidential candidates.
A Los Angles Times survey completed Jan. 29 showed Bush, the Texas governor, topping Gore 57 percent to 39 percent.
Vice President Al Gore, in a show of political force to kick off his 2000 presidential campaign, secured the endorsements Monday of House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and party stalwarts from the early battleground states of New Hampshire and Iowa.
Shortly after announcing he would not be a presidential candidate, Gephardt told Gore over lunch that he would endorse him.
