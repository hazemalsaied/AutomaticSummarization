Washington _ Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has filed for divorce from his wife of 18 years, saying his marriage is "irretrievably broken." The estranged wife of former U.S. House speaker Newt Gingrich wants a Cobb County, Ga., judge to freeze the couple's assets until their divorce is final.
Mayoue has said he intends to question Bisek about all aspects of her relationship with Newt Gingrich.
By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches not only end their 18-year marriage, but also avoid answering specific charges they've made against each other since Newt Gingrich filed for the divorce in July.
