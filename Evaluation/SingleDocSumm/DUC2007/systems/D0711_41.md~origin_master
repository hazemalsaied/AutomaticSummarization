The Justice Department has renewed its scrutiny of alleged antitrust violations by the software giant Microsoft Corp., U.S. newspapers reported today.
Business seemed as usual at Microsoft headquarters on the first day of the U.S. government's antitrust trial against this software giant.
In its antitrust trial, the Microsoft Corp. is expected to introduce documents this week intended to contradict testimony by an IBM executive who said Microsoft would offer the computer maker a favorable price on its Windows operating system only if IBM agreed to ``eliminate or drop'' its competing operating system, OS/2.
