The opening of Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade continues to inch closer, despite the latest vow Wednesday by Aboriginal landowners to block the development.
Construction of Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade was under way Tuesday, after a protracted legal battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing environmental protest.
The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
Police arrested more than 100 protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern Territory.
