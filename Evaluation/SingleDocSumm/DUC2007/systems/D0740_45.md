Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that he has chosen Brian Jones as his teammate for his next attempt at circling the world in a balloon.
Their Cable and Wireless balloon, which launched from Spain on Feb. 17, has broken balloon endurance records for time aloft.
Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard and his new teammate, British flight engineer Tony Brown, said Thursday they will be ready later this month for a new attempt to fly nonstop round the world.
It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world.
Switzerland is optimistic
