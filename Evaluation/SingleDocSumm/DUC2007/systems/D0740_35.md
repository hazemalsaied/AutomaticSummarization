LONDON (AP) -- A pair of British balloonists trying to circumnavigate the Earth had a surprise visit Friday when they crossed the path of a Boeing 747.
Andy Elson and Colin Prescot were flying 25,000 feet over the South China Sea on Friday when the captain of a passing airliner radioed a request to approach the balloon, the team's London spokesmen said.
The balloonists agreed, and when they looked out their observation dome they saw hundreds of passengers peering out of windows and snapping pictures.
