    of the Jabiluka uranium mine.
</a><a name="1">[1]</a><a href="#1" id="1">The mine is in Kakadu National Park, which is on the UNESCO World Heritage
    list of important cultural and environmental sites.

    concerned with the potential for consigning tons of radioactive waste in an environmentally sensitive area, and by
    opposition parties, who claimed the government ignored the wishes of Aboriginal people in the area.
</a><a name="3">[3]</a><a href="#3" id="3">The government defended their decision saying the mine would generate
    millions of revenue dollars and create 2,000 jobs.
