<body bgcolor="white"><a name="0">[0]</a><a href="#0" id="0">On January 12, 1997, a Swiss/Belgian team took off from the
    Swiss Alps in a bid to balloon non-stop around the world.
</a><a name="1">[1]</a><a href="#1" id="1">Expecting to travel for about two weeks, the two men aborted their attempt
    six hours after takeoff due to a hazardous fuel leak.

    quest but had to abandon their journey as China refused them entry into its airspace.

    permission from China to fly over its terrain, prepared for a third attempt at the feat.
