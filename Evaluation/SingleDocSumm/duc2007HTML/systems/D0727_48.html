    relying on a financial agreement he and his wife worked out during a six-year separation that began when the former
    House Speaker came back to an empty home.

    divorce out of a public arena - for now.

    but also avoid answering specific charges they 've made against each other since Newt Gingrich filed for the divorce
    in July.
