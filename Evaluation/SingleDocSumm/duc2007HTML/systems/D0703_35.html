    benefit from the 1999 introduction of the single European currency, the euro, thanks to expanded investment
    opportunities, reduced currency risks, and rising competitions, the German central bank Bundesbank said Monday.

    national currency boundaries vanish and most European stocks and bonds are denominated in euros, investors will be
    able to make use of a variety of cross-border investment opportunities in the euro area which will become the second
    largest capital market in the world.
