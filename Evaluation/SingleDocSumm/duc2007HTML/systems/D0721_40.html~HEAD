    Shepard, a 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been tortured, strung up like an animal and left to die on a
    fence outside Laramie, Wyo., the Family Research Council was co-hosting a press conference in Washington.

    gay college student in Wyoming ended chaotically on Monday night, with nearly 100 arrests and several injuries after
    demonstrators faced off against police officers in riot gear and on horseback.
