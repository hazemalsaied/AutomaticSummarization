    would also include Peter Knight, Clinton's campaign chairman in 1996 and former Gore chief of staff; another former
    vice presidential chief of staff, Jack Quinn; the current chief, Ron Klain, and former Rep. But the vice president's
    campaign for the White House faces a fresh challenge from some Democrats in Congress who want Gore to criticize the
    president's conduct to help the party distinguish itself more effectively from Clinton on the hot-button issue of
    personal values.
