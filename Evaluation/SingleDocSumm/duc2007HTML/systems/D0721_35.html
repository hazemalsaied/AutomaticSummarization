    Shepard murder trial, saying they ``gravely injured'' the defendant's right to a fair trial.
</a><a name="2">[2]</a><a href="#2" id="2">``There exists a very real danger that counsel's playing to the media has
    already gravely injured, or at least made much more difficult, the prospect of seating a jury in this case,'' Judge
    Barton R. Voigt wrote Thursday.
</a><a name="3">[3]</a><a href="#3" id="3">Voigt's ruling stemmed from a dispute between lawyers representing Aaron
    McKinney and Russell Henderson.
