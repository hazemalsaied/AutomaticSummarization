    detained another 187 members of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party, bringing the total to 702 arrested
    since a crackdown began in May, the party said Friday.

    opposition members since the nationwide democracy uprising in 1988.
</a><a name="2">[2]</a><a href="#2" id="2">More than half the arrests have taken place since Sunday, in an apparent
    government effort to stymie the National League for Democracy's announced plans to convene parliament.
