    6: Russell Henderson's decision to plead guilty to kidnapping and murder of Matthew Shepard is little consolation to
    Shepard family, but it provides an appropriately severe sentence for one whose apparent anti-gay hatred led him to
    destroy a young life.

    his wallet,'' continued Henderson, who said that while he drove his friend beat Shepard.
</a><a name="2">[2]</a><a href="#2" id="2">The stress on Shepard family was so great, she continued, that within a month
    of Matthew's funeral, his paternal grandfather died.
