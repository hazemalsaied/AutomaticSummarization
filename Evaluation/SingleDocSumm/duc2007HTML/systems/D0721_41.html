    kidnapping and murder of Matthew Shepard is little consolation to the Shepard family, but it provides an
    appropriately severe sentence for one whose apparent anti-gay hatred led him to destroy a young life.

    reported hate crimes in this country in 1997, according to the latest FBI figures.

    appropriate responses to this criminal act.
