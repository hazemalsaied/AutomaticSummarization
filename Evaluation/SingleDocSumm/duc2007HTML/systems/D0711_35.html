    antitrust trial and earlier legal actions against the Microsoft Corp. have cost $13.3 million over the past decade,
    the department said Wednesday in its first public accounting.

    trial pending before U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, described as among the most significant business
    lawsuits in decades.
</a><a name="2">[2]</a><a href="#2" id="2">The first phase of a two-part verdict could come this month.
</a><a name="3">[3]</a><a href="#3" id="3">Experts described the $7 million as paltry compared with the expense of other
    major antitrust cases, where costs easily can run $750,000 each month.
