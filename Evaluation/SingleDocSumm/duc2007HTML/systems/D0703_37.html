    benefit from 1999 introduction of single European currency, euro, thanks to expanded investment opportunities,
    reduced currency risks, and rising competitions, German central bank Bundesbank said Monday.

    and improved market transparency resulting from heated competitions among financial institutions after advent of
    euro, Bundesbank said.
