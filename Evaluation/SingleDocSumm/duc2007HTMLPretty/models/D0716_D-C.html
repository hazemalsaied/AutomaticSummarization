    permission to Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) to open the Jabiluka uranium mine on the edge of the Kakadu
    National Park which is on the World Heritage List, in Australia's Northern Territory.</a>

    owners of the land oppose the mine while ERA insists that its environmental record has been proven by the 16-year
    operation of the Ranger mine, also located in the Kakadu Park.</a>
