    from the Swiss Alps in a bid to balloon non-stop around the world.</a>
<a name="D0740_I-H">[D0740_I-H]</a> <a href="#D0740_I-H" id=D0740_I-H>Expecting to travel for about two weeks, the two
    men aborted their attempt six hours after takeoff due to a hazardous fuel leak.</a>
<a name="D0740_I-H">[D0740_I-H]</a> <a href="#D0740_I-H" id=D0740_I-H>About a year later, the team (now also including
    an Englishman) resumed the quest but had to abandon their journey as China refused them entry into its airspace.</a>
<a name="D0740_I-H">[D0740_I-H]</a> <a href="#D0740_I-H" id=D0740_I-H>By late December of 1998, a revamped Swiss/British
    team, with conditional permission from China to fly over its terrain, prepared for a third attempt at the feat.</a>
