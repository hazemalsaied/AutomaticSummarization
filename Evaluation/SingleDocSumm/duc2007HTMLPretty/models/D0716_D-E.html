    development of the Jabiluka uranium mine.</a>

    environmentalists, who were concerned with the potential for consigning tons of radioactive waste in an
    environmentally sensitive area, and by opposition parties, who claimed the government ignored the wishes of
    Aboriginal people in the area.</a>
<a name="D0716_D-E">[D0716_D-E]</a> <a href="#D0716_D-E" id=D0716_D-E>The government defended their decision saying the
    mine would generate millions of revenue dollars and create 2,000 jobs.</a>
