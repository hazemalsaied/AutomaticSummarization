<a name="D0711_35">[D0711_35]</a> <a href="#D0711_35" id=D0711_35>WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department's landmark
    antitrust trial and earlier legal actions against the Microsoft Corp. have cost $13.3 million over the past decade,
    the department said Wednesday in its first public accounting.</a>
<a name="D0711_35">[D0711_35]</a> <a href="#D0711_35" id=D0711_35>The figure includes about $7 million investigating and
    suing Microsoft in the trial pending before U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, described as among the most
    significant business lawsuits in decades.</a>
<a name="D0711_35">[D0711_35]</a> <a href="#D0711_35" id=D0711_35>The first phase of a two-part verdict could come this
    month.</a>
<a name="D0711_35">[D0711_35]</a> <a href="#D0711_35" id=D0711_35>Experts described the $7 million as paltry compared
    with the expense of other major antitrust cases, where costs easily can run $750,000 each month.</a></body>
