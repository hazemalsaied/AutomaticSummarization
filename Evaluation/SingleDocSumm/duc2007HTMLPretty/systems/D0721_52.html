    in the death of Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who was lured from a bar in October and fatally beaten.</a>
<a name="D0721_52">[D0721_52]</a> <a href="#D0721_52" id=D0721_52>Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only
    that she and her husband "want to allow justice to run its course." What remains as certain now as on Oct. 12, the
    day Matthew died, is that this murder happened against the backdrop of a campaign in which the far right, abetted by
    political leaders like Trent Lott, was demonizing gay people as sick and sinful.</a></body>
