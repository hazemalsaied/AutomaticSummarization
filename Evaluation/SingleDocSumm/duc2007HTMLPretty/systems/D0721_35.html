<a name="D0721_35">[D0721_35]</a> <a href="#D0721_35" id=D0721_35>(AP) -- A judge has issued a gag order for lawyers
    involved in the Matthew Shepard murder trial, saying they ``gravely injured'' the defendant's right to a fair
    trial.</a>
<a name="D0721_35">[D0721_35]</a> <a href="#D0721_35" id=D0721_35>``There exists a very real danger that counsel's
    playing to the media has already gravely injured, or at least made much more difficult, the prospect of seating a
    jury in this case,'' Judge Barton R. Voigt wrote Thursday.</a>
<a name="D0721_35">[D0721_35]</a> <a href="#D0721_35" id=D0721_35>Voigt's ruling stemmed from a dispute between lawyers
    representing Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson.</a></body>
