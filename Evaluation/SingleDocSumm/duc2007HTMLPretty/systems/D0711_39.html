    operating system for the first ibm pc in 1981, ibm has been out-hustled and outsmarted by Microsoft in the pc
    business _ not the sort of behavior the nation's antitrust laws were meant to prohibit.</a>
<a name="D0711_39">[D0711_39]</a> <a href="#D0711_39" id=D0711_39>Antitrust experts note, it is certainly legal for
    Microsoft to offer a distributor _ as the ibm pc business was _ incentives to aggressively distribute its
    product.</a>

    Microsoft's Windows over os/2 _ made by another unit of ibm _ that is mainly a business decision for ibm to make,
