    filed for divorce from his wife of 18 years, saying his marriage is "irretrievably broken." The estranged wife of
    former U.S. House speaker Newt Gingrich wants a Cobb County, Ga., judge to freeze the couple's assets until their
    divorce is final.</a>

    aspects of her relationship with Newt Gingrich.</a>
<a name="D0727_43">[D0727_43]</a> <a href="#D0727_43" id=D0727_43>By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches not only end
    their 18-year marriage, but also avoid answering specific charges they've made against each other since Newt
    Gingrich filed for the divorce in July.</a>
