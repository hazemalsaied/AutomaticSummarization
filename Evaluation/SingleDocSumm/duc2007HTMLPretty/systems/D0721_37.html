    April 6: Russell Henderson's decision to plead guilty to kidnapping and murder of Matthew Shepard is little
    consolation to Shepard family, but it provides an appropriately severe sentence for one whose apparent anti-gay
    hatred led him to destroy a young life.</a>
<a name="D0721_37">[D0721_37]</a> <a href="#D0721_37" id=D0721_37>``Aaron McKinney, he pulled out a gun and told Matthew
    Shepard to give him his wallet,'' continued Henderson, who said that while he drove his friend beat Shepard.</a>
<a name="D0721_37">[D0721_37]</a> <a href="#D0721_37" id=D0721_37>The stress on Shepard family was so great, she
    continued, that within a month of Matthew's funeral, his paternal grandfather died.</a></body>
