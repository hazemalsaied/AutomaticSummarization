    aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of huge Jabiluka uranium mine in country's vast Kakadu National
    Park, which is on World Heritage List, after federal government approved mining plan for Jabilika mine
    yesterday.</a>

    indicated Jabiluka mine contains about 19.5 million tons of ore, which could provide more than 90,400 tons of
    uranium oxide.</a>
