    committee would also include Peter Knight, Clinton's campaign chairman in 1996 and former Gore chief of staff;
    another former vice presidential chief of staff, Jack Quinn; the current chief, Ron Klain, and former Rep. But the
    vice president's campaign for the White House faces a fresh challenge from some Democrats in Congress who want Gore
    to criticize the president's conduct to help the party distinguish itself more effectively from Clinton on the
    hot-button issue of personal values.</a></body>
