<a name="D0711_52">[D0711_52]</a> <a href="#D0711_52" id=D0711_52>Microsoft Corp., whose business practices are being
    challenged by the government in a major antitrust case, suffered a legal setback on another front Tuesday when a
    federal judge in California ordered the company to stop shipping Internet software that violates its contract with a
    rival, Sun Microsystems Inc.</a>
<a name="D0711_52">[D0711_52]</a> <a href="#D0711_52" id=D0711_52>Much of the detailed, company-by-company information
    on the prices to makers for Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system was submitted in previous
    testimony.</a>
<a name="D0711_52">[D0711_52]</a> <a href="#D0711_52" id=D0711_52>Antitrust experts said that most countries still
    investigating Microsoft's practices were taking a wait-and-see stance toward the company, pending the outcome of the
    major U.S. antitrust case.</a></body>
