    circumnavigate the Earth had a surprise visit Friday when they crossed the path of a Boeing 747.</a>
<a name="D0740_35">[D0740_35]</a> <a href="#D0740_35" id=D0740_35>Andy Elson and Colin Prescot were flying 25,000 feet
    over the South China Sea on Friday when the captain of a passing airliner radioed a request to approach the balloon,
    the team's London spokesmen said.</a>
<a name="D0740_35">[D0740_35]</a> <a href="#D0740_35" id=D0740_35>The balloonists agreed, and when they looked out their
    observation dome they saw hundreds of passengers peering out of windows and snapping pictures.</a></body>
