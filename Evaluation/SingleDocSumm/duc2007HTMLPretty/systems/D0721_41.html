    kidnapping and murder of Matthew Shepard is little consolation to the Shepard family, but it provides an
    appropriately severe sentence for one whose apparent anti-gay hatred led him to destroy a young life.</a>

    more than 1,100 reported hate crimes in this country in 1997, according to the latest FBI figures.</a>
<a name="D0721_41">[D0721_41]</a> <a href="#D0721_41" id=D0721_41>The conviction of one man and the trial of another for
    his murder are appropriate responses to this criminal act.</a>
