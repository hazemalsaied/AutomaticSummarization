    has detained another 187 members of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party, bringing the total to 702
    arrested since a crackdown began in May, the party said Friday.</a>
<a name="D0706_35">[D0706_35]</a> <a href="#D0706_35" id=D0706_35>If the figure is accurate, it would be the largest
    number of arrests of opposition members since the nationwide democracy uprising in 1988.</a>
<a name="D0706_35">[D0706_35]</a> <a href="#D0706_35" id=D0706_35>More than half the arrests have taken place since
    Sunday, in an apparent government effort to stymie the National League for Democracy's announced plans to convene
    parliament.</a>
<a name="D0706_35">[D0706_35]</a> <a href="#D0706_35" id=D0706_35>The NLD said 194 members of parliament are among the
    arrested party members.</a></body>
