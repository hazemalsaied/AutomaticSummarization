What constitutes a clear sepaÂ­ ration into senses for any one verb, and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished?
We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.
Two current approaches to English verb classiÂ­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).
Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntacÂ­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning preÂ­ serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).
It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr, 1997).
The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose.

This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.

The sole member of this intersection is the verb draw.
The adÂ­ junction of the apart adverb adds a change of state semantic component with respect to the object which is not present otherwise.
This is exemplified by the Levin cut verbs and the intersective class formed by the cut verbs and split verbs.

Whereas high level semantic relations (synÂ­ onym, hypernym) are represented directly in WordNet, they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes, as with the cut/split class.
However, other intersective classes, such as the split/push/carry class, are no more conÂ­ sistent with WordNet than the original Levin classes.

However, apart can also be used with other classes of verbs, including many verbs of motion.
Some manner of motion verbs allow a transitive alternation in addition to the basic inÂ­ transitive.

These verbs are listed in the intersective classes with meander verbs of existence.

We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses.

Most of these verbs take the same alternations as in English and, by virtue of these alternations, achieve the same regular sense extensions.
In this experiment, we have tried to choose the Portuguese verb that is most closely related to the description of the English verb in the Levin class.
We expect these cross-linguistic features to be useful for capturing translation generalizations between languages as discussed in the literaÂ­ ture (Palmer and Rosenzweig, 1996), (CopesÂ­ take and Sanfilippo, 1993), (Dorr, 1997).
