Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every 8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus.
For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere (location) is different to exo- sphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers of the earthâs atmosphere.
Broad semantic classification is currently used by lexicographers to or- ganise the manual insertion of words into WORDNET, and is an experimental precursor to automatically inserting words directly into the WORDNET hierarchy.

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call the noun lex-file classes supersenses.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call the noun lex-file classes supersenses.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.
Widdows (2003) uses a similar technique to insert words into the WORDNET hierarchy.
He first extracts synonyms for the unknown word using vector-space similarity measures based on Latent Semantic Analysis and then searches for a location in the hierarchy nearest to these synonyms.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) propose a very natural evaluation for supersense tagging inserting the extra common nouns that have been added to a new version of WORDNET.
Our evaluation will use exactly the same test sets as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).

JACCARD and TTEST produced better quality synonyms than existing measures in the literature, so we use Curran and Moenâs configuration for our super- sense tagging experiments.
Our approach uses voting across the known supersenses of automatically extracted synonyms, to select a super- sense for the unknown nouns.
