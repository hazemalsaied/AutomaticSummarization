Mining New Word Translations from Comparable Corpora
But parallel corpora are scarce resources, especially for uncommon lan guage pairs.
Comparable corpora refer to texts that are not direct translation but are about the same topic.
For example, various news agencies report major world events in different languages, and such news documents form a readily available source of comparable corpora.
When translating a word w, two sources of information can be used to determine its translation the word w itself and the surrounding words in the neighborhood (i.e., the context) of w. Most previous research only considers one of the two sources of information, but not both.
For example, the work of (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002a; AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation.
On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.
In this paper, we propose a new approach for the task of mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining both context and transliteration information.
That is, Chinese is the source language and English is the target language.
