The character-based âIOBâ tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).

The character-based âIOBâ tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).
Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as âBâ if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or âOâ if the character functions as an independent word, or âIâ otherwise.â For example, â (whole) (Beijing city)â is labeled as â (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/Iâ.
In addition, we found a clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach It yields a very low in-vocabulary (IV) rate (R-iv) in return for a higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate (R-oov).

In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (CRF) for the IOB tagging, yielded very high R-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.

While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired.

For a character-based IOB tagger, there is only one possibility of re-segmentation.
However, there are multiple choices for a subword-based IOB tagger.
In this section we introduce a confidence measure approach to combine the two results.
For the dictionary-based approach, we extracted a word list from the training data as the vocabulary.
Tri- gram LMs were generated using the SRI LM toolkit for disambiguation.
