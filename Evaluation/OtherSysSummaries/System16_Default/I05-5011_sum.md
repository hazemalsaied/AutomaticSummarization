Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
There has been a lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.
If the expression is longer or complicated (like âA buys Bâ and âAâs purchase of Bâ), it is called âparaphraseâ, i.e. a set of phrases which express the same thing or event.

Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.
For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.
We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.
In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.

We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.

Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword.
However, there are phrases which express the same meanings even though they do not share the same keyword.
It is natural that the larger the data in the domain, the more keywords are found.
Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.
