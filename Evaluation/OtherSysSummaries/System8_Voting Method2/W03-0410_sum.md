A number of supervised learning approaches have extracted such information about verbs from corpora, including their argument roles (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), selectional preferences (Resnik, 1996), and lexical semantic classification (i.e., grouping verbs according to their argument structure properties) (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Lapata and Brew, 1999; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Joanis and Stevenson, 2003).

Unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches have been successful as well, but have tended to be more restrictive, in relying on human filtering of the results (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998), on the hand- selection of features (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), or on the use of an extensive grammar (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002).

We focus here on extending the applicability of unsupervised methods, as in (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), to the lexical semantic classification of verbs.

We have previously shown that a broad set of 220 noisy features performs well in supervised verb classification (Joanis and Stevenson, 2003).

In this paper, we report results on several feature selection approaches to the problem manual selection (based on linguistic knowledge), unsupervised selection (based on an entropy measure among the features, Dash et al., 1997), and a semi- supervised approach (in which seed verbs are used to train a supervised learner, from which we extract the useful features).
Here we briefly describe the features that comprise our feature space, and refer the interested reader to Joanis and Stevenson (2003) for details.

We use the same classes and example verbs as in the supervised experiments of Joanis and Stevenson (2003) to enable a comparison between the performance of the unsupervised and supervised methods.

Of these verbs, 20 from each class were randomly selected to use as training data for our supervised experiments in Joanis and Stevenson (2003).
Our second measure, the adjusted Rand measure used by Schulte im Walde (2003), instead gives a measure of how consistent the given clustering is overall with respect to the gold standard classification.

However, it gives important information about the quality of a clustering The other measures being equal, a clustering with a higher value indicates tighter and more separated clusters, suggesting stronger inherent patterns in the data.
The first subcolumn (Full) under each of the three clustering evaluation measures in Table 2 shows the results using the full set of features (i.e., no feature selection).
Following Joanis and Stevenson (2003), for each class, we systematically identified the subset of features 4 These results differ slightly from those reported in Joanis and Stevenson (2003), because of our slight changes in verb sets, discussed in Section 3.2.

Each clustering experiment used the full set of 20 verbs per class; i.e., seed verbs were included, following our proposed model of guided verb class discovery.5 The results using these feature sets are shown in the third subcolumn (Seed) under our three evaluation measures in Table 2.
