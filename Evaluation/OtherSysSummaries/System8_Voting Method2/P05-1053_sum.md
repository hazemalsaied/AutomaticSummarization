This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking.

Yet further research work is still expected to make it effective with complicated relation extraction tasks such as the one defined in ACE.
Complicated relation extraction tasks may also impose a big challenge to the modeling approach used by Miller et al (2000) which integrates various tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, template element extraction and relation extraction, in a single model.

Compared with Kambhatla (2004), we separately incorporate the base phrase chunking information, which contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect.
Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that our system outperforms Kambhatla (2004) by about 3 F-measure on extracting 24 ACE relation subtypes.

In addition, we distinguish the argument order of the two mentions (M1 for the first mention and M2 for the second mention), e.g. M1-Parent- Of-M2 vs. M2-Parent-Of-M1.
For each pair of mentions3, we compute various lexical, syntactic and semantic features.

For example, in the case where the noun phrase âthe former CEO of McDonaldâ has the head annotation of âCEOâ and the extent annotation of âthe former CEO of McDonaldâ, we only consider âthe former CEOâ in this paper.
This feature concerns about the entity type of both the mentions, which can be PERSON, ORGANIZATION, FACILITY, LOCATION and GeoPolitical Entity or GPE â¢ ET12 combination of mention entity types 4.3 Mention Level.
This category of features includes â¢ #MB number of other mentions in between â¢ #WB number of words in between â¢ M1>M2 or M1<M2 flag indicating whether M2/M1is included in M1/M2.
In this paper, we separate the features of base phrase chunking from those of full parsing.

Similar to word features, three categories of phrase heads are considered 1) the phrase heads in between are also classified into three bins the first phrase head in between, the last phrase head in between and other phrase heads in between; 2) the phrase heads before M1 are classified into two bins the first phrase head before and the second phrase head before; 3) the phrase heads after M2 are classified into two bins the first phrase head after and the second phrase head after.
Semantic information from various resources, such as WordNet, is used to classify important words into different semantic lists according to their indicating relationships.

This paper uses the ACE corpus provided by LDC to train and evaluate our feature-based relation extraction system.
In this paper, we only model explicit relations because of poor inter-annotator agreement in the annotation of implicit relations and their limited number.

In this paper, we have presented a feature-based approach for relation extraction where diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge are employed.
Instead of exploring the full parse tree information directly as previous related work, we incorporate the base phrase chunking information performance improvement from syntactic aspect while further incorporation of the parse tree and dependence tree information only slightly improves the performance.
While short-distance relations dominate and can be resolved by simple features such as word and chunking features, the further dependency tree and parse tree features can only take effect in the remaining much less and more difficult long-distance relations.
Besides, we also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance.
The effective incorporation of diverse features enables our system outperform previously best- reported systems on the ACE corpus.
Although tree kernel-based approaches facilitate the exploration of the implicit feature space with the parse tree structure, yet the current technologies are expected to be further advanced to be effective for relatively complicated relation extraction tasks such as the one defined in ACE where 5 types and 24 subtypes need to be extracted.

Evaluation on the ACE RDC task shows that our approach of combining various kinds of evidence can scale better to problems, where we have a lot of relation types with a relatively small amount of annotated data.
