Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task.

We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.

The accuracy of the sets in representing paraphrase ranged from 73% to 99%, depending on the NE categories and set sizes; the accuracy of the links for two evaluated domains was 73% and 86%.
Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.
For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.

Also, in Information Extraction (IE), in which the system tries to extract elements of some events (e.g. date and company names of a corporate merger event), several event instances from different news articles have to be aligned even if these are expressed differently.
The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [Sekine et al. 2004].
These 140 NE categories are designed by extending MUCâs 7 NE categories with finer sub-categories (such as Company, Institute, and Political Party for Organization; and Country, Province, and City for Location) and adding some new types of NE categories (Position Title, Product, Event, and Natural Object).

One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].

The basic strategy is, for a given pair of entity types, to start with some examples, like several famous book title and author pairs; and find expressions which contains those names; then using the found expressions, find more author and book title pairs.
The discovered paraphrases can be a big help to reduce human labor and create a more comprehensive pattern set.
