We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.

In addition, the latter can be used to balance out-of-vocabulary rates and in-vocabulary rates.
By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.
The character-based âIOBâ tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).

Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as âBâ if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or âOâ if the character functions as an independent word, or âIâ otherwise.â For example, â (whole) (Beijing city)â is labeled as â (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/Iâ.
