Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement.
This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking.

We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance.
Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that effective incorporation of diverse features enables our system outperform previously best-reported systems on the 24 ACE relation subtypes and significantly outperforms tree kernel-based systems by over 20 in F-measure on the 5 ACE relation types.
With the dramatic increase in the amount of textual information available in digital archives and the WWW, there has been growing interest in techniques for automatically extracting information from text.
According to the scope of the NIST Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program, current research in IE has three main objectives Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT), Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC), and Event Detection and Characterization (EDC).

Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information contributes to most of the performance inprovement from syntactic aspect while additional full parsing information does not contribute much, largely due to the fact that most of relations defined in ACE corpus are within a very short distance.
We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet (Miller 1990) and Name List can be used in the feature-based framework.
Implicit relations need not have explicit supporting evidence in text, though they should be evident from a reading of the document.

Qc 2005 Association for Computational Linguistics ture-based approach outperforms tree kernel-based approaches by 11 F-measure in relation detection and more than 20 F-measure in relation detection and classification on the 5 ACE relation types.
Miller et al (2000) augmented syntactic full parse trees with semantic information corresponding to entities and relations, and built generative models for the augmented trees.
Zelenko et al (2003) proposed extracting relations by computing kernel functions between parse trees.
Culotta et al (2004) extended this work to estimate kernel functions between augmented dependency trees and achieved 63.2 F-measure in relation detection and 45.8 F-measure in relation detection and classification on the 5 ACE relation types.

Tree kernel-based approaches proposed by Zelenko et al (2003) and Culotta et al (2004) are able to explore the implicit feature space without much feature engineering.
