In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.

We present a refinement of Levin classes, intersecÂ­ tive sets, which are a more fine-grained clasÂ­ sification and have more coherent sets of synÂ­ tactic frames and associated semantic compoÂ­ nents.

We also have begun to exÂ­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties.
However, the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computaÂ­ tional lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods, although attempts are being made (Pustejovsky, 1991), (Copestake and SanÂ­ filippo, 1993), (Lowe et al., 1997), (Dorr, 1997).

We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.

Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996).

Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntacÂ­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning preÂ­ serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).

It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr, 1997).

This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.
Even though the Levin verb classes are defined by their syntactic behavior, many reflect semanÂ­ tic distinctions made by WordNet, a classificaÂ­ tion hierarchy defined in terms of purely seÂ­ mantic word relations (synonyms, hypernyms, etc.).
Whereas each WordNet synset is hierarchicalized accordÂ­ ing to only one aspect (e.g., Result, in the case of cut), Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features, without designating one as primary.
Intersective Levin sets partition these classes according to more coÂ­ herent subsets of features (force, force+motion, force+separation), in effect highlighting a lattice of semantic features that determine the sense of a verb.

We expect these cross-linguistic features to be useful for capturing translation generalizations between languages as discussed in the literaÂ­ ture (Palmer and Rosenzweig, 1996), (CopesÂ­ take and Sanfilippo, 1993), (Dorr, 1997).
In pursuing this goal, we are currently implementÂ­ ing features for motion verbs in the English Tree-Adjoining Grammar, TAG (Bleam et al., 1998).
