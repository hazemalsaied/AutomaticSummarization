However, to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense.
While various alternatives have been proposed, making use of e.g. neural networks, a situation seÂ­ mantics framework, or the principles of reasoning with uncertainty (e.g. Connoly et al. 1994; Mitkov 1995; Tin & Akman 1995), there is still a strong need for the development of robust and effective strategies to meet the demands of practical NLP systems, and to enhance further the automatic proÂ­ cessing of growing language resources.

Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).
With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semanÂ­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for realÂ­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowlÂ­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.

It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as "antecedent indicators").
The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÂ­ maining candidates (see next section).

Antecedent indicators (preferences) play a decisive role in tracking down the antecedent from a set of possible candidates.
The antecedent indicators have been identiÂ­ fied empirically and are related to salience (definiteness, givenness, indicating verbs, lexical reiteration, section heading preference, "nonÂ­ prepositional" noun phrases), to structural matches (collocation, immediate reference), to referential distance or to preference of terms.
For anaphors in simple sentences, noun phrases in the previous senÂ­ tence are the best candidate for antecedent, followed by noun phrases situated 2 sentences further back and finally nouns 3 sentences further back {1, 0, -1).
For practical reasons, the approach presented does not incorporate syntactic and semantic information (other than a list of domain terms) and it is not realÂ­ istic to expect its performance to be as good as an approach which makes use of syntactic and semantic knowledge in terms of constraints and preferences.

The lack of syntactic information, for instance, means giving up c-cornmand constraints and subject preference (or on other occasions object preference, see Mitkov I995) which could be used in center tracking.
3.1 Evaluation A. Our first evaluation exercise (Mitkov & Stys 1997) was based on a random sample text from a technical manual in English (Minolta 1994).
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the apÂ­ proach and to explore if I how far it is superior over the baseline models for anaphora resolution, we also tested the sample text on (i) a Baseline Model which checks agreement in number and gender and, where more than one candidate remains, picks as anteceÂ­ dent the most recent subject matching the gender and number of the anaphor (ii) a Baseline Model which picks as antecedent the most recent noun phrase that matches the gender and number of the anaphor.
The success rate of the "Baseline Subject" was 29.2%, whereas the success rate of "Baseline Most Recent NP" was 62.5%.
This measure (Mitkov 1998b) applies only to anaphors "ambiguous" from the point of view of number and gender (i.e. to those "tough" anaphors which, after activating the gender and number filters, still have more than one candidate for antecedent) and is indicative of the performance of the antecedent indicators.

The relaÂ­ tively low figures for the majority of indicators should not be regarded as a surprise firstly, we should bear in mind that in most cases a candidate was picked (or rejected) as an antecedent on the baÂ­ sis of applying a number of different indicators and secondly, that most anaphors had a relatively high number of candidates for antecedent.

Given that our approach is robust and returns anÂ­ tecedent for each pronoun, in order to make the comparison as fair as possible, we used CogNIAC's "resolve all" version by simulating it manually on the same training data used in evaluation B above.

This result is comparable with the results described in (Baldwin 1997).
For the training data from the genre of technical manuals, it was rule 5 (see Baldwin 1997) which was most frequently used (39% of the cases, 100% success), followed by rule 8 (33% of the cases, 33% success), rule 7 (11%, 100%), rule I (9%, 100%) and rule 3 (7.4%, 100%).
