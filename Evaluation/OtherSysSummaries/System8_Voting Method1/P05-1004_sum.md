The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is a significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present a tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNETâs hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.
Supersense tagging is also interesting for many applications that use shallow semantics, e.g. information extraction and question answering.
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) implement a super- sense tagger based on the multi-class perceptron classifier (Crammer and Singer, 2001), which uses the standard collocation, spelling and syntactic features common in WSD and named entity recognition systems.
