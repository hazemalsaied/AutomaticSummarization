However, the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computa? tional lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods, although attempts are being made (Pustejovsky, 1991), (Copestake and San? filippo, 1993), (Lowe et al., 1997), (Dorr, 1997).
We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, inter? sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.

The difficulty of determining a suitable lexical representation becomes multi? plied when more than one language is involved and attempts are made to map between them.
WordNet is an on? line lexical database of English that currently contains approximately 120,000 sets of noun, verb, adjective, and adverb synonyms, each rep? resenting a lexicalized concept.

The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class member? ship.
Whereas high level semantic relations (syn? onym, hypernym) are represented directly in WordNet, they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes, as with the cut/split class.
