An initial step of any text? analysis task is the tokenization of the input into words.
For a language like English, this problem is generally regarded as trivial since words are delimited in English text by whitespace or marks of punctuation.
And if one is interested in TIS, one would probably consider the single orthographic word ACL to consist of three phonological words-lei s'i d/-corresponding to the pronunciation of each of the letters in the acronym.

Most languages that use Roman, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, or Semitic scripts, and many that use Indian-derived scripts, mark orthographic word boundaries; however, languages written in a Chinese-derived writ? ing system, including Chinese and Japanese, as well as Indian-derived writing systems of languages like Thai, do not delimit orthographic words.1 Put another way, written Chinese simply lacks orthographic words.

Making the reasonable assumption that similar information is relevant for solving these problems in Chinese, it follows that a prerequisite for intonation-boundary assignment and prominence assignment is word segmentation.
There are thus some very good reasons why segmentation into words is an important task.
There is a sizable literature on Chinese word segmentation recent reviews include Wang, Su, and Mo (1990) and Wu and Tseng (1993).
Purely statistical approaches have not been very popular, and so far as we are aware earlier work by Sproat and Shih (1990) is the only published instance of such an approach.

Similarly, there is no compelling evidence that either of the syllables of f.ifflll binllang2 'betelnut' represents a morpheme, since neither can occur in any context without the other more likely fjfflll binllang2 is a disyllabic morpheme.
The simplest version of the maximum matching algorithm effectively deals with ambiguity by ignoring it, since the method is guaranteed to produce only one segmentation.
Methods that allow multiple segmentations must provide criteria for choosing the best segmentation.
Following Sproat and Shih (1990), performance for Chinese segmentation systems is generally reported in terms of the dual measures of precision and recalP It is fairly standard to report precision and recall scores in the mid to high 90% range.
Besides the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a correct segmentation for a given Chinese sentence, there is the more general issue that the test corpora used in these evaluations differ from system to system, so meaningful comparison between systems is rendered even more difficult.
More formally, we start by representing the dictionary D as a Weighted Finite State Trans? ducer (WFST) (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994).
selected; and that recall is defined to be the number of correct hits divided by the number of items that should have been selected.
Clearly this is not the only way to estimate word-frequencies, however, and one could consider applying other methods in partic? ular since the problem is similar to the problem of assigning part-of-speech tags to an untagged corpus given a lexicon and some initial estimate of the a priori probabilities for the tags, one might consider a more sophisticated approach such as that described in Kupiec (1992); one could also use methods that depend on a small hand-tagged seed corpus, as suggested by one reviewer.

10 Here we use the Good-Turing estimate (Baayen 1989; Church and Gale 1991), whereby the aggregate probability of previously unseen instances of a construction is estimated as ni/N, where N is the total number of observed tokens and n1 is the number of types observed only once.

This WFST is then summed with the WFST implementing the dictionary and morphological rules, and the transitive closure of the resulting transducer is computed; see Pereira, Riley, and Sproat (1994) for an explanation of the notion of summing WFSTs.12 Conceptual Improvements over Chang et al.'s Model.
