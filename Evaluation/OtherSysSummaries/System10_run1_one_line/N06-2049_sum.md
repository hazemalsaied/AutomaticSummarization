The character-based ?IOB? tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).
The character-based ?IOB? tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).
Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as ?B? if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or ?O? if the character functions as an independent word, or ?I? otherwise.? For example, ? (whole) (Beijing city)? is labeled as ? (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/I?.

In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.

In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (CRF) for the IOB tagging, yielded very high R-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.
While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired.
In this work we propose a confidence measure approach to lessen the weakness.
It is composed of three parts a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging.

A confidence measure threshold, t, was defined for making a decision based on the value.
