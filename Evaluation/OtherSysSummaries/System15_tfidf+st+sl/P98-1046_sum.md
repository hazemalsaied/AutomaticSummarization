We present a refinement of Levin classes, intersecÃÂÃÂ­ tive sets, which are a more fine-grained clasÃÂÃÂ­ sification and have more coherent sets of synÃÂÃÂ­ tactic frames and associated semantic compoÃÂÃÂ­ nents.

What constitutes a clear sepaÃÂÃÂ­ ration into senses for any one verb, and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished?
We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÃÂÃÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.

Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996).
WordNet is an onÃÂÃÂ­ line lexical database of English that currently contains approximately 120,000 sets of noun, verb, adjective, and adverb synonyms, each repÃÂÃÂ­ resenting a lexicalized concept.
Words and synsets are interrelated by means of lexical and semantic-conceptual links, respecÃÂÃÂ­ tively.
The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class memberÃÂÃÂ­ ship.
The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class memberÃÂÃÂ­ ship.
The fundamental assumption is that the syntactic frames are a direct reflection of the unÃÂÃÂ­ derlying semantics.
Where break is concerned, the only thing speciÃÂÃÂ­ fied is the resulting change of state where the object becomes separated into pieces.
It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr, 1997).
Does it indicate that more than one sense of the verb is involved, or is one sense primary, and the alternations for that class should take precedence over the alternations for the other classes in which the verb is listed?

This filter alÃÂÃÂ­ lowed us to reject the potential intersective class that would have resulted from combining the reÃÂÃÂ­ move verbs with the scribble verbs, for example.

On the other hand, the scribble verbs do form an intersective class with the perforÃÂÃÂ­ mance verbs, since paint and write are also in both classes, in addition to draw.
A verb was assigned membership in an intersective class if it was listed in each of the existing classes that were combined to form the new intersective class.

isolate semantic components Some of the large Levin classes comprise verbs that exhibit a wide range of possible semantic components, and could be divided into smaller subclasses.
The adÃÂÃÂ­ junction of the apart adverb adds a change of state semantic component with respect to the object which is not present otherwise.
Although the Levin classes that make up an intersective class may have conflicting alternaÃÂÃÂ­ tions {e.g., verbs of exerting force can take the conative alternation, while carry verbs cannot), this does not invalidate the semantic regularity of the intersective class.

The original intersective class (cut, hack, hew, saw) exhibits alternations of both parent classes, and has been augmented with chip, clip, slash, snip since these cut verbs also display the syntactic properties of split verbs.
WordNet distinguishes two subclasses of cut, differentiated by the type of result 1.
