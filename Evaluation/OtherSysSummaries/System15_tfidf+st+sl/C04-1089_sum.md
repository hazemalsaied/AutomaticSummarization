New words such as names, technical terms, etc appear frequently.
As such, the bilingual lexicon of a machine translation system has to be constantly updated with these new word translations.
Comparable corpora such as news documents of the same period from different news agencies are readily available.
In this paper, we present a new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information.

Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).
Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).
But parallel corpora are scarce resources, especially for uncommon lan guage pairs.
Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations, although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora.

On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.
Koehn and Knight (2002) attempted to combine multiple clues, including similar context and spelling.
