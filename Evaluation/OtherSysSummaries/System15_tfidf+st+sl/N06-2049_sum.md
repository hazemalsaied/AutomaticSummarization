We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.
We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation.
By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.
The character-based Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂIOBÃá¸ÃÂÃÂ tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).

Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂBÃá¸ÃÂÃÂ if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂOÃá¸ÃÂÃÂ if the character functions as an independent word, or Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂIÃá¸ÃÂÃÂ otherwise.Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂ For example, Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂ (whole) (Beijing city)Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂ is labeled as Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂ (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/IÃá¸ÃÂÃÂ.
In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.

We will give a detailed description of this approach in Section 2.

By this approach we can change R-oovs and R-ivs and find an optimal tradeoff.
In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method.
It is composed of three parts a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging.

In the third step, we used the CRFs approach to train the IOB tagger (Lafferty et al., 2001) on the training data.
For the bigram features, we only used the previous and the current observations, tÃá¸ÃÂÃÂ1 t0 . As to feature selection, we simply used absolute counts for each feature in the training data.
We used the data provided by Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections.
Since this work was to evaluate the proposed subword-based IOB tagging, we carried out the closed test only.
For the dictionary-based approach, we extracted a word list from the training data as the vocabulary.
The segmentation results using CRF tagging are shown in Table 2, where the upper numbers of each slot were produced by the character-based approach while the lower numbers were of the subword-based.
Comparing Table 1 and 2, we found the CRF-modeled IOB tagging yielded better segmentation than the dictionary- based approach.

Later, this approach was implemented by the CRF-based method (Peng and McCallum, 2004), which was proved to achieve better results than the maximum entropy approach because it can solve the label bias problem (Lafferty et al., 2001).

By way of the confidence measure we combined results from the dictionary-based and the IOB-tagging-based and as a result, we could achieve the optimal performance.
In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation.
