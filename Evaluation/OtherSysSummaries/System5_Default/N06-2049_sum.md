In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (CRF) for the IOB tagging, yielded very high R-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.

Our word segmentation process is illustrated in Fig.

Of course, backward maximal match (BMM) or other approaches are also applicable.
We defined a cutoff value for each feature type and selected the features with occurrence counts over the cutoff.

A forward-backward algorithm was used in the training and viterbi algorithm was used in the decoding.
In this section we introduce a confidence measure approach to combine the two results.
A new OOV was thus created.
In Section 3.2 we will present the experimental segmentation results of the confidence measure approach.
We used the data provided by Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections.
For the dictionary-based approach, we extracted a word list from the training data as the vocabulary.

In fact, there were no OOV recognition.
For AS corpus, âAdam Smithâ are two words in the training but become a one- word in the test, âAdamSmithâ.
In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation.
