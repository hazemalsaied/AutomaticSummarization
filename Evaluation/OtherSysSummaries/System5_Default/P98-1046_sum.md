Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996).
Two current approaches to English verb classiÂ­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).
Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntacÂ­ tic frames that are in some sense meaning preÂ­ serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).

The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class memberÂ­ ship.

The explanation given is that cut describes a series of actions diÂ­ rected at achieving the goal of separating some object into pieces.

This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.
Figure 1 Algorithm for identifying relevant semantic-class intersections We then reclassified the verbs in the database as follows.

Simultaneously, the verb was removed from the membership lists of those existing classes.

The split verbs (cut, draw, kick, knock, push, rip, roll, shove, slip, split, etc.) do not obviously form a homogeneous semanÂ­ tic class.
The adÂ­ junction of the apart adverb adds a change of state semantic component with respect to the object which is not present otherwise.
It is exactly those verbs that are triple-listed in the split/push/carry intersective class (which have force exertion as a semantic component) that can take the conative.
However, other intersective classes, such as the split/push/carry class, are no more conÂ­ sistent with WordNet than the original Levin classes.

However, apart can also be used with other classes of verbs, including many verbs of motion.
motion Figure 3 shows intersective classes involving two classes of verbs of manner of motion (run and roll verbs) and a class of verbs of existence (meÂ­ ander verbs).
Roll and run verbs have semanÂ­ tic components describing a manner of motion that typically, though not necessarily, involves change of location.
For these verbs, we have the inÂ­ duced action alternation by using the light verb fazer (make) before the verb, as in Maria fez o barco flutuar (Mary floated the boat).
Given the incompleteness of the list of members of Levin classes, each verb must be examined to see whether it exhibits all the alÂ­ ternations of a class.

In pursuing this goal, we are currently implementÂ­ ing features for motion verbs in the English Tree-Adjoining Grammar, TAG (Bleam et al., 1998).
