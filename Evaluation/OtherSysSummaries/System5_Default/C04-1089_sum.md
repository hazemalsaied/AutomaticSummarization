As such, the bilingual lexicon of a machine translation system has to be constantly updated with these new word translations.
Comparable corpora such as news documents of the same period from different news agencies are readily available.
For example, the work of (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002a; AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation.
In this paper, we propose a new approach for the task of mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining both context and transliteration information.

We used a list of 1,580 ChineseEnglish name pairs as training data for the EM algorithm.

We call Section 4), which was used to rank the English candidate words based on transliteration.
#c is the total number of new Chinese source words in the period.
is the precision.
Similarly, AlOnaizan and Knight (2002a; 2002b) only made use of transliteration information alone and so was not directly comparable.
This list of 43 words is shown in Table 3.
Rankâ is the transliteration rank.
We thank Jia Li for implementing the EM algorithm to train transliteration probabilities.
