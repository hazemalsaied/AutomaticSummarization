The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language.
Pr(eI 1) is the language model of the target language, whereas Pr(fJ 1 jeI1) is the transla tion model.
In Section 4, we present the performance measures used and give translation results on the Verbmobil task.

To explicitly handle the word reordering between words in source and target language, we use the concept of the so-called inverted alignments as given in (Ney et al., 2000).

This algorithm can be applied to statistical machine translation.
The complexity of the algorithm is O(E3 J2 2J), where E is the size of the target language vocabulary.
Restrictions Quasi-monotone Search The above search space is still too large to allow the translation of a medium length input sentence.
The complexity of the quasimonotone search is O(E3 J (R2+LR)).
