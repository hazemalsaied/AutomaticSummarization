So, there is a limitation that IE can only be performed for a predefined task, like âcorporate mergersâ or âmanagement successionâ.
In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.

All the sentences have been analyzed by our chunker and NE tag- ger.
Find keywords for each NE pair The keywords are found for each NE category pair.
For example, in the CC-domain, 96 keywords are found which have TF/ITF scores above a threshold; some of them are shown in Figure 3.
In the CC-domain, there are 32 sets of phrases which contain more than 2 phrases.
In the CC-domain, there are 32 sets of phrases which contain more than 2 phrases.
Although this is not a precise criterion, most cases we evaluated were relatively clear-cut.
Evaluation within a set The evaluation of paraphrases within a set of phrases which share a keyword is illustrated in Figure 4.
We will return to these issues in the discussion section.
This result suggests the benefit of using the automatic discovery method.
They cluster NE instance pairs based on the words in the contexts using a bag- of-words method.
There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.
Limitations There are several limitations in the methods.

Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.
