We also examine similar classes in Portuguese, and the predictive powers of alternations in this language with respect to the same semantic components.

The difficulty of determining a suitable lexical representation becomes multi? plied when more than one language is involved and attempts are made to map between them.
Words and synsets are interrelated by means of lexical and semantic-conceptual links, respec? tively.
The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class member? ship.

The fundamental assumption is that the syntactic frames are a direct reflection of the un? derlying semantics.

For example, break verbs and cut verbs are similar in that they can all participate in the transitive and in the mid? dle construction, John broke the window, Glass breaks easily, John cut the bread, This loaf cuts easily.
If the result is not achieved, there are no attempted breaking actions that can still be recognized.

However, it would be useful for the WordNet senses to have access to the detailed syntactic information that the Levin classes contain, and it would be equally useful to have more guidance as to when membership in a Levin class does in fact indicate shared seman? tic components.
The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose.

For in? stance, carry verbs are described as not taking the conative, *The mother carried at the baby, and yet many of the verbs in the carry class {push, pull, tug, shove, kick) are also listed in the push/pull class, which does take the cona? tive.
The sole member of this intersection is the verb draw.
Whereas high level semantic relations (syn? onym, hypernym) are represented directly in WordNet, they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes, as with the cut/split class.
