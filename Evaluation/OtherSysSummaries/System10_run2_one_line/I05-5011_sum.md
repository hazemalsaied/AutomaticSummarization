We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.
If the expression is a word or a short phrase (like ?corporation? and ?company?), it is called a ?synonym?.
For example, we can easily imagine that the number of paraphrases for ?A buys B? is enormous and it is not possible to create a comprehensive inventory by hand.
Also, we don?t know how many such paraphrase sets are necessary to cover even some everyday things or events.
Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.

We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.
We use a simple TF/IDF method to measure the topicality of words.

Figure 4 shows some such phrase sets based on keywords in the CC-domain.
One is the accuracy within a set of phrases which share the same keyword; the other is the accuracy of links.
It is not easy to make a clear definition of ?paraphrase?.
Out of those 15 links, 4 are errors, namely ?buy - pay?, ?acquire - pay?, ?purchase - stake? ?acquisition - stake?.
