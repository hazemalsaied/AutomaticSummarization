We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation.

The character-based ?IOB? tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).
Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as ?B? if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or ?O? if the character functions as an independent word, or ?I? otherwise.? For example, ? (whole) (Beijing city)? is labeled as ? (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/I?.
While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired.

It is composed of three parts a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging.
