We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.

We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.

Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.
For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.
For example, we can easily imagine that the number of paraphrases for âA buys Bâ is enormous and it is not possible to create a comprehensive inventory by hand.
We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.

Here a set is represented by the keyword and the number in parentheses indicates the number of shared NE pair instances.
buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.
Evaluation within a set The evaluation of paraphrases within a set of phrases which share a keyword is illustrated in Figure 4.
For each set, the phrases with bracketed frequencies are considered not paraphrases in the set.
This result suggests the benefit of using the automatic discovery method.
There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.
Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].

Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.
The discovered paraphrases can be a big help to reduce human labor and create a more comprehensive pattern set.
Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically.
While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system.
