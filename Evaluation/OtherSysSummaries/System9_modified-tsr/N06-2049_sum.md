In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (CRF) for the IOB tagging, yielded very high R-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.

It is composed of three parts a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging.

Later, this approach was implemented by the CRF-based method (Peng and McCallum, 2004), which was proved to achieve better results than the maximum entropy approach because it can solve the label bias problem (Lafferty et al., 2001).
