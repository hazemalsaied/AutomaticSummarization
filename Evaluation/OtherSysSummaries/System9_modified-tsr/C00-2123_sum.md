The alignment model uses two kinds of parameters alignment probabilities p(aj jajô1; I; J), where the probability of alignment aj for position j depends on the previous alignment position ajô1 (Ney et al., 2000) and lexicon probabilities p(fj jeaj ).

When aligning the words in parallel texts (for language pairs like SpanishEnglish, French-English, ItalianGerman,...), we typically observe a strong localization effect.

A procedural definition to restrict1In the approach described in (Berger et al., 1996), a mor phological analysis is carried out and word morphemes rather than full-form words are used during the search.

Although the ultimate goal of the Verbmobil project is the translation of spoken language, the input used for the translation experiments reported on in this paper is the (more or less) correct orthographic transcription of the spoken sentences.
We show translation results for three approaches the monotone search (MonS), where no word reordering is allowed (Tillmann, 1997), the quasimonotone search (QmS) as presented in this paper and the IBM style (IbmS) search as described in Section 3.2.
