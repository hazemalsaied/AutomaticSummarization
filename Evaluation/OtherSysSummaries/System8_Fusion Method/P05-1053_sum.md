In addition, we distinguish the argument order of the two mentions (M1 for the first mention and M2 for the second mention), e.g. M1-Parent- Of-M2 vs. M2-Parent-Of-M1.
For each pair of mentions3, we compute various lexical, syntactic and semantic features.

Similar to word features, three categories of phrase heads are considered 1) the phrase heads in between are also classified into three bins the first phrase head in between, the last phrase head in between and other phrase heads in between; 2) the phrase heads before M1 are classified into two bins the first phrase head before and the second phrase head before; 3) the phrase heads after M2 are classified into two bins the first phrase head after and the second phrase head after.

In this paper, we have presented a feature-based approach for relation extraction where diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge are employed.
Instead of exploring the full parse tree information directly as previous related work, we incorporate the base phrase chunking information performance improvement from syntactic aspect while further incorporation of the parse tree and dependence tree information only slightly improves the performance.
Besides, we also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance.
The effective incorporation of diverse features enables our system outperform previously best- reported systems on the ACE corpus.

Although tree kernel-based approaches facilitate the exploration of the implicit feature space with the parse tree structure, yet the current technologies are expected to be further advanced to be effective for relatively complicated relation extraction tasks such as the one defined in ACE where 5 types and 24 subtypes need to be extracted.
