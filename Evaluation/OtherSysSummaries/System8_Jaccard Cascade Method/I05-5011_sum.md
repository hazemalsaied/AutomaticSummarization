Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.

We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.

There has been a lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.
Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.
For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.
Also, in Information Extraction (IE), in which the system tries to extract elements of some events (e.g. date and company names of a corporate merger event), several event instances from different news articles have to be aligned even if these are expressed differently.

We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.

As we shall see, most of the linked sets are paraphrases.

Overview of the method 2.2 Step by Step Algorithm.
Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword.
There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.
One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].
Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].
One possibility is to use n-grams based on mutual information.
It is a relatively frequent word in the domain, but it can be used in different extraction scenarios.
