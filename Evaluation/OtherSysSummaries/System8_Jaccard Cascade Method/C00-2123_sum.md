In this paper, we describe a search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT) based on dynamic programming (DP).

A search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented.
The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language.
The model is often further restricted so that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word (Brown et al., 1993; Ney et al., 2000).

This approach is compared to another reordering scheme presented in (Berger et al., 1996).
In this section, we brie y review our translation approach.
The alignment model uses two kinds of parameters alignment probabilities p(aj jajô1; I; J), where the probability of alignment aj for position j depends on the previous alignment position ajô1 (Ney et al., 2000) and lexicon probabilities p(fj jeaj ).

To explicitly handle the word reordering between words in source and target language, we use the concept of the so-called inverted alignments as given in (Ney et al., 2000).

The complexity of the quasimonotone search is O(E3 J (R2+LR)).
For each source word f, the list of its possible translations e is sorted according to p(fje) puni(e), where puni(e) is the unigram probability of the English word e. It is suÃcient to consider only the best 50 words.
In this paper, we have presented a new, eÃcient DP-based search procedure for statistical machine translation.
