We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.
We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.
By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.
The character-based âIOBâ tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).

If only Chinese characters are used, the subword-based IOB tagging is downgraded into a character-based one.
In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (CRF) for the IOB tagging, yielded very high R-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.
In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method.
First, we extracted a word list from the training data sorted in decreasing order by their counts in the training 193 Proceedings of the Human Language Technology Conference of the North American Chapter of the ACL, pages 193â196, New York, June 2006.

In the third step, we used the CRFs approach to train the IOB tagger (Lafferty et al., 2001) on the training data.
In this section we introduce a confidence measure approach to combine the two results.
We used the data provided by Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections.
Since this work was to evaluate the proposed subword-based IOB tagging, we carried out the closed test only.
For the dictionary-based approach, we extracted a word list from the training data as the vocabulary.

It proves the proposed word-based IOB tagging was very effective.
Later, this approach was implemented by the CRF-based method (Peng and McCallum, 2004), which was proved to achieve better results than the maximum entropy approach because it can solve the label bias problem (Lafferty et al., 2001).
