 Supersense Tagging of Unknown Nouns using Semantic Similarity
 The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is a significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.
 Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNETs hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.
 Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call the noun lex-file classes supersenses.
 Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.
 These categories are used to label paragraphs with topics, effectively repeating Yarowskys (1992) experiments using the their categories rather than Rogets thesaurus.
 Widdows (2003) uses a similar technique to insert words into the WORDNET hierarchy.

 Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) propose a very natural evaluation for supersense tagging inserting the extra common nouns that have been added to a new version of WORDNET.

 Our results significantly outperform Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) on both test sets even though our system is unsupervised.
