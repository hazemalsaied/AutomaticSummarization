 Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs
 We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.
 There has been a lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.
 For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a users query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the users question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.
 Also, we dont know how many such paraphrase sets are necessary to cover even some everyday things or events.
 Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.

 We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.

 Extract NE instance pairs with contexts First, we extract NE pair instances with their context from the corpus.

 In this section, we will explain the algorithm step by step with examples.
 However, there are phrases which express the same meanings even though they do not share the same keyword.

 [Hasegawa et al. 04] reported only on relation discovery, but one could easily acquire para phrases from the results.
 Applications The discovered paraphrases have multiple applications.
