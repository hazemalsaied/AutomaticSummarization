 Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation
 We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.
 We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.
 The character-based IOB tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).

 We will give a detailed description of this approach in Section 2.

 In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (CRF) for the IOB tagging, yielded very high R-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.

 While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired.
 This approach will be described in Section 2.2.
 In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method.
 Section 3 presents our experimental results.
 It is composed of three parts a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging.
 We defined a cutoff value for each feature type and selected the features with occurrence counts over the cutoff.
 In this section we introduce a confidence measure approach to combine the two results.
 We used the data provided by Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections.
 For the dictionary-based approach, we extracted a word list from the training data as the vocabulary.
 Tri- gram LMs were generated using the SRI LM toolkit for disambiguation.
 The effect of the confidence measure is shown in Table 3, where we used  = 0.7 and confidence threshold t = 0.8.
 Even with the use of confidence measure, the word- based IOB tagging still outperformed the character-based IOB tagging.
 It was first used in Chinese word segmentation by (Xue and Shen, 2003), where maximum entropy methods were used.
 In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation.
 Using the CRFs approaches, we prove that it outperformed the character- based method using the CRF approaches.
