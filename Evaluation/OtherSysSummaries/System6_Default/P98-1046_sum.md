 Investigating regular sense extensions based on intersective Levin classes
 Current approaches to English classifica tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limita tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes.
 We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, inter sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.

 Two current approaches to English verb classi fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).

 Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntac tic frames that are in some sense meaning pre serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).

 The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class member ship.

 2.1 Ambiguities in Levin classes.
 It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr, 1997).
 The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose.

 The sole member of this intersection is the verb draw.
 Figure 1 Algorithm for identifying relevant semantic-class intersections We then reclassified the verbs in the database as follows.
 A verb was assigned membership in an intersective class if it was listed in each of the existing classes that were combined to form the new intersective class.

 The list of members for each Levin verb class is not always complete, so to check if a particular verb belongs to a class it is better to check that the verb exhibits all the alternations that de fine the class.
 Although the Levin classes that make up an intersective class may have conflicting alterna tions {e.g., verbs of exerting force can take the conative alternation, while carry verbs cannot), this does not invalidate the semantic regularity of the intersective class.
 This is exemplified by the Levin cut verbs and the intersective class formed by the cut verbs and split verbs.
 In addition, only one verb (pull) has a WordNet sense cor responding to the change of state - separation semantic component associated with the split class.
 Some manner of motion verbs allow a transitive alternation in addition to the basic in transitive.
 Many of the verbs participate in alternations that are direct trans lations of the English alternations.
 We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses.
