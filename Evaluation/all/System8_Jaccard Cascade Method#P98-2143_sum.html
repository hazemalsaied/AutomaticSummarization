<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53>It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as "antecedent indicators").</a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54>The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÂ­ maining candidates (see next section).</a>

<a name="66">[66]</a> <a href="#66" id=66>The lack of syntactic information, for instance, means giving up c-cornmand constraints and subject preference (or on other occasions object preference, see Mitkov I995) which could be used in center tracking.</a>
