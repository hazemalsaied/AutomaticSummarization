<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>However, to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Our work is a continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaphÂ­ ora resolution.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>It is also an example of how anaphors in a specific genre can be resolved quite successfully without any sophisticated linguistic knowledge or even without parsing.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The approach works as follows it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÂ­ maining candidates (see next section).</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Antecedent indicators (preferences) play a decisive role in tracking down the antecedent from a set of possible candidates.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Press iti again.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Immediate reference In technical manuals the "immediate reference" clue can often be useful in identifying the antecedent.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>As already mentioned, each of the antecedent inÂ­ dicators assigns a score with a value {-1, 0, 1, 2}.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>The algorithm for pronoun resolution can be deÂ­ scribed informally as follows 1.</a>

<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>A case where the system failed was when the anaphor and the antecedent were in the same senÂ­ tence and where preference was given to a candidate in the preceding sentence.</a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>The results from experiment 1 and experiment 2 can be summarised in the following (statistically) slightly more representative figures.</a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>The reason is that both our approach and Breck Baldwin's approach share common principles (both are knowledge-poor and use a POS tagger to provide the input) and therefore a comparison would be appropriate.</a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>This result is comparable with the results described in (Baldwin 1997).</a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49>For the training data from the genre of technical manuals, it was rule 5 (see Baldwin 1997) which was most frequently used (39% of the cases, 100% success), followed by rule 8 (33% of the cases, 33% success), rule 7 (11%, 100%), rule I (9%, 100%) and rule 3 (7.4%, 100%).</a>
