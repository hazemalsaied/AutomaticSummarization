<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computaÂ­ tional lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods, although attempts are being made (Pustejovsky, 1991), (Copestake and SanÂ­ filippo, 1993), (Lowe et al., 1997), (Dorr, 1997).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Two current approaches to English verb classiÂ­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).</a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr, 1997).</a>

<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.</a>

<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Does it indicate that more than one sense of the verb is involved, or is one sense primary, and the alternations for that class should take precedence over the alternations for the other classes in which the verb is listed?</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>When examining in detail the intersecÂ­ tive classes just described, which emphasize not only the individual classes, but also their relaÂ­ tion to other classes, we see a rich semantic latÂ­ tice much like WordNet.</a>

<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>However, other intersective classes, such as the split/push/carry class, are no more conÂ­ sistent with WordNet than the original Levin classes.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Whereas each WordNet synset is hierarchicalized accordÂ­ ing to only one aspect (e.g., Result, in the case of cut), Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features, without designating one as primary.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Intersective Levin sets partition these classes according to more coÂ­ herent subsets of features (force, force+motion, force+separation), in effect highlighting a lattice of semantic features that determine the sense of a verb.</a>

<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Most of these verbs take the same alternations as in English and, by virtue of these alternations, achieve the same regular sense extensions.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>We expect these cross-linguistic features to be useful for capturing translation generalizations between languages as discussed in the literaÂ­ ture (Palmer and Rosenzweig, 1996), (CopesÂ­ take and Sanfilippo, 1993), (Dorr, 1997).</a>
