<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53>â¢ Chunking features are very useful.</a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54>â¢ To our surprise, incorporating the dependency tree and parse tree features only improve the F- measure by 0.6 and 0.4 respectively.</a>
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55>However, full parsing is always prone to long distance errors although the Collinsâ parser used in our system represents the state-of-the-art in full parsing.</a>
<a name="56">[56]</a> <a href="#56" id=56>â¢ Incorporating semantic resources such as the country name list and the personal relative trigger word list further increases the F-measure by 1.5 largely due to the differentiation of the relation subtype âROLE.Citizen-Ofâ from âROLE.</a>

<a name="67">[67]</a> <a href="#67" id=67>Although tree kernel-based approaches facilitate the exploration of the implicit feature space with the parse tree structure, yet the current technologies are expected to be further advanced to be effective for relatively complicated relation extraction tasks such as the one defined in ACE where 5 types and 24 subtypes need to be extracted.</a>
