<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userÃá¸ÃÂÃÂs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userÃá¸ÃÂÃÂs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.</a>

<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>We use a simple TF/IDF method to measure the topicality of words.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [Sekine et al. 2004].</a>

<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>As can be seen in the example, the first two phrases have a different order of NE names from the last two, so we can determine that the last two phrases represent a reversed relation.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>In this subsection, we will report the results of the experiment, in terms of the number of words, phrases or clusters.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Here a set is represented by the keyword and the number in parentheses indicates the number of shared NE pair instances.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>The similar explanation applies to the link to the Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂstakeÃá¸ÃÂÃÂ set.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>One possibility is to use n-grams based on mutual information.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Using structural information As was explained in the results section, we extracted examples like Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂSmith estimates LotusÃá¸ÃÂÃÂ, from a sentence like Ãá¸ÃÂÃÂMr.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically.</a>
