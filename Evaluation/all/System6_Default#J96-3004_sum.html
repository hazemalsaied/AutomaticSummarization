<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1> All notions of word, with the exception of the orthographic word, are as relevant in Chinese as they are in English, and just as is the case in other languages, a word in Chinese may correspond to one or more symbols in the orthog 1 For a related approach to the problem of word-segrnention in Japanese, see Nagata (1994), inter alia..</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Thus, if one wants to segment words-for any purpose-from Chinese sentences, one faces a more difficult task than one does in English since one cannot use spacing as a guide.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> For example, suppose one is building a ITS system for Mandarin Chinese.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> In various dialects of Mandarin certain phonetic rules apply at the word.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> It has been shown for English (Wang and Hirschberg 1992; Hirschberg 1993; Sproat 1994, inter alia) that grammatical part of speech provides useful information for these tasks.</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> There are thus some very good reasons why segmentation into words is an important task.</a>

<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> This latter evaluation compares the performance of the system with that of several human judges since, as we shall show, even people do not agree on a single correct way to segment a text.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16> There is a sizable literature on Chinese word segmentation recent reviews include Wang, Su, and Mo (1990) and Wu and Tseng (1993).</a>

<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18> Purely statistical approaches have not been very popular, and so far as we are aware earlier work by Sproat and Shih (1990) is the only published instance of such an approach.</a>

<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20> Mutual information was shown to be useful in the segmentation task given that one does not have a dictionary.</a>

<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25> However, the characterization given in the main body of the text is correct sufficiently often to be useful.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26> Papers that use this method or minor variants thereof include Liang (1986), Li et al.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27> (1991}, Gu and Mao (1994), and Nie, Jin, and Hannan (1994).</a>

<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30> Others depend upon various lexical heuris tics for example Chen and Liu (1992) attempt to balance the length of words in a three-word window, favoring segmentations that give approximately equal length for each word.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31> Methods for expanding the dictionary include, of course, morphological rules, rules for segmenting personal names, as well as numeral sequences, expressions for dates, and so forth (Chen and Liu 1992; Wang, Li, and Chang 1992; Chang and Chen 1993; Nie, Jin, and Hannan 1994).</a>

<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33> Approaches differ in the algorithms used for scoring and selecting the best path, as well as in the amount of contextual information used in the scoring process.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34> More complex approaches such as the relaxation technique have been applied to this problem Fan and Tsai (1988}.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35> Several papers report the use of part-of-speech information to rank segmentations (Lin, Chiang, and Su 1993; Peng and Chang 1993; Chang and Chen 1993); typically, the probability of a segmentation is multiplied by the probability of the tagging(s) for that segmentation to yield an estimate of the total probability for the analysis.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36> Several systems propose statistical methods for handling unknown words (Chang et al. 1992; Lin, Chiang, and Su 1993; Peng and Chang 1993).</a>

<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38> Following Sproat and Shih (1990), performance for Chinese segmentation systems is generally reported in terms of the dual measures of precision and recalP It is fairly standard to report precision and recall scores in the mid to high 90% range.</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39> Indeed, as we shall show in Section 5, even human judges differ when presented with the task of segmenting a text into words, so a definition of the criteria used to determine that a given segmentation is correct is crucial before one can interpret such measures.</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40> For example Chen and Liu (1992) report precision and recall rates of over 99%, but this counts only the words that occur in the test corpus that also occur in their dictionary.</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41> Chinese word segmentation can be viewed as a stochastic transduction problem.</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42> More formally, we start by representing the dictionary D as a Weighted Finite State Trans ducer (WFST) (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994).</a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43> As we have seen, the lexicon of basic words and stems is represented as a WFST; most arcs in this WFST represent mappings between hanzi and pronunciations, and are costless.</a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44> The method just described segments dictionary words, but as noted in Section 1, there are several classes of words that should be handled that are not found in a standard dictionary.</a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45> One class comprises words derived by productive morphologi cal processes, such as plural noun formation using the suffix ir, menD.</a>

<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48> Figure 5 shows how this model is implemented as part of the dictionary WFST.</a>

<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50> The transition from f, to a final state transduces c to the grammatical tag PL with cost cost(unseen(f,)) cost(iJJ1l.ir,) == cost(iJJ1l.)</a>
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51> 10 Chinese speakers may object to this form, since the suffix f, menD (PL) is usually restricted to.</a>

<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53> This WFST is then summed with the WFST implementing the dictionary and morphological rules, and the transitive closure of the resulting transducer is computed; see Pereira, Riley, and Sproat (1994) for an explanation of the notion of summing WFSTs.12 Conceptual Improvements over Chang et al.'s Model.</a>
