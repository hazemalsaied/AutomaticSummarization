<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every 8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere (location) is different to exo- sphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers of the earthâs atmosphere.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call the noun lex-file classes supersenses.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Widdows (2003) uses a similar technique to insert words into the WORDNET hierarchy.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>He first extracts synonyms for the unknown word using vector-space similarity measures based on Latent Semantic Analysis and then searches for a location in the hierarchy nearest to these synonyms.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) propose a very natural evaluation for supersense tagging inserting the extra common nouns that have been added to a new version of WORDNET.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Our evaluation will use exactly the same test sets as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).</a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>JACCARD and TTEST produced better quality synonyms than existing measures in the literature, so we use Curran and Moenâs configuration for our super- sense tagging experiments.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Our approach uses voting across the known supersenses of automatically extracted synonyms, to select a super- sense for the unknown nouns.</a></body>
