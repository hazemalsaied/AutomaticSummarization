<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But parallel corpora are scarce resources, especially for uncommon lan guage pairs.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Comparable corpora refer to texts that are not direct translation but are about the same topic.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, various news agencies report major world events in different languages, and such news documents form a readily available source of comparable corpora.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>When translating a word w, two sources of information can be used to determine its translation the word w itself and the surrounding words in the neighborhood (i.e., the context) of w. Most previous research only considers one of the two sources of information, but not both.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For example, the work of (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002a; AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In this paper, we propose a new approach for the task of mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining both context and transliteration information.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>That is, Chinese is the source language and English is the target language.</a>
