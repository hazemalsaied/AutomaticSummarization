<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The character-based ?IOB? tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as ?B? if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or ?O? if the character functions as an independent word, or ?I? otherwise.? For example, ? (whole) (Beijing city)? is labeled as ? (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/I?.</a>
