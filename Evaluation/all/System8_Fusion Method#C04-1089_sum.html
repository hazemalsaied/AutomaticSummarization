<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But parallel corpora are scarce resources, especially for uncommon lan guage pairs.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations, although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora.</a>
