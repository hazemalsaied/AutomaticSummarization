<a name="57">[57]</a> <a href="#57" id=57>Furthermore, even the size of the dictionary per se is less important than the appropriateness of the lexicon to a particular test corpus as Fung and Wu (1994) have shown, one can obtain substantially better segmentation by tailoring the lexicon to the corpus to be segmented.</a>

<a name="90">[90]</a> <a href="#90" id=90>16 As one reviewer points out, one problem with the unigram model chosen here is that there is still a. tendency to pick a segmentation containing fewer words.</a>
<a name="91">[91]</a> <a href="#91" id=91>However, this result is consistent with the results of exÂ­ periments discussed in Wu and Fung (1994).</a>
<a name="92">[92]</a> <a href="#92" id=92>For a given "word" in the automatic segmentation, if at least k of the huÂ­ man judges agree that this is a word, then that word is considered to be correct.</a>
<a name="93">[93]</a> <a href="#93" id=93>Interestingly, Chang et al. report 80.67% recall and 91.87% precision on an 11,000 word corpus seemingly, our system finds as many names as their system, but with four times as many false hits.</a>

<a name="95">[95]</a> <a href="#95" id=95>In a more recent study than Chang et al., Wang, Li, and Chang (1992) propose a surname-driven, non-stochastic, rule-based system for identifying personal names.17 Wang, Li, and Chang also compare their performance with Chang et al.'s system.</a>
<a name="96">[96]</a> <a href="#96" id=96>In this paper we have argued that Chinese word segmentation can be modeled efÂ­ fectively using weighted finite-state transducers.</a>
<a name="97">[97]</a> <a href="#97" id=97>This architecture provides a uniform framework in which it is easy to incorporate not only listed dictionary entries but also morphological derivatives, and models for personal names and foreign names in transliteration.</a>

<a name="99">[99]</a> <a href="#99" id=99>First of all, most previous articles report perforÂ­ mance in terms of a single percent-correct score, or else in terms of the paired measures of precision and recall.</a>
<a name="100">[100]</a> <a href="#100" id=100>This is not to say that a set of standards by which a particular segmentation would count as correct and another incorrect could not be devised; indeed, such standards have been proposed and include the published PRCNSC (1994) and ROCLING (1993), as well as the unpublished Linguistic Data Consortium standards (ca.</a>
<a name="101">[101]</a> <a href="#101" id=101>However, until such standards are universally adopted in evaluating Chinese segmenters, claims about performance in terms of simple measures like percent correct should be taken with a grain of salt; see, again, Wu and Fung (1994) for further arguments supporting this conclusion.</a>
<a name="102">[102]</a> <a href="#102" id=102>Unfortunately, there is no standard corpus of Chinese texts, tagged with either single or multiple human judgments, with which one can compare performance of various methods.</a>
<a name="103">[103]</a> <a href="#103" id=103>The major problem for our segÂ­ menter, as for all segmenters, remains the problem of unknown words (see Fung and Wu [1994]).</a>

<a name="106">[106]</a> <a href="#106" id=106>As described in Sproat (1995), the Chinese segmenter presented here fits directly into the context of a broader finite-state model of text analysis for speech synthesis.</a>

<a name="108">[108]</a> <a href="#108" id=108>Furthermore, by inverting the transducer so that it maps from phonemic transcriptions to hanzi sequences, one can apply the segmenter to other problems, such as speech recognition (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994).</a></body>
