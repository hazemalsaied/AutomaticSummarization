<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Current approaches to English classifica tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limita tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, inter sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.</a>

<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntac tic frames that are in some sense meaning pre serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).</a>

<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17> 2.1 Ambiguities in Levin classes.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18> It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr, 1997).</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19> The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose.</a>

<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21> The sole member of this intersection is the verb draw.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22> Figure 1 Algorithm for identifying relevant semantic-class intersections We then reclassified the verbs in the database as follows.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23> A verb was assigned membership in an intersective class if it was listed in each of the existing classes that were combined to form the new intersective class.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24> A verb was assigned membership in an intersective class if it was listed in each of the existing classes that were combined to form the new intersective class.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25> The list of members for each Levin verb class is not always complete, so to check if a particular verb belongs to a class it is better to check that the verb exhibits all the alternations that de fine the class.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26> Although the Levin classes that make up an intersective class may have conflicting alterna tions {e.g., verbs of exerting force can take the conative alternation, while carry verbs cannot), this does not invalidate the semantic regularity of the intersective class.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27> This is exemplified by the Levin cut verbs and the intersective class formed by the cut verbs and split verbs.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28> In addition, only one verb (pull) has a WordNet sense cor responding to the change of state - separation semantic component associated with the split class.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29> Some manner of motion verbs allow a transitive alternation in addition to the basic in transitive.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30> Many of the verbs participate in alternations that are direct trans lations of the English alternations.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31> We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses.</a>
