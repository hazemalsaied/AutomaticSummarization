<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present a tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only a very small degree of overlap.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNETâs hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) implement a super- sense tagger based on the multi-class perceptron classifier (Crammer and Singer, 2001), which uses the standard collocation, spelling and syntactic features common in WSD and named entity recognition systems.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) propose a very natural evaluation for supersense tagging inserting the extra common nouns that have been added to a new version of WORDNET.</a>

<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This is not surprising since these concrete words tend to have very fewer other senses, well constrained contexts and a relatively high frequency.</a></body>
