This approach is similar in spirit to the iterative computational approaches of the Hidden Markov Models ( Kupiec , 1989 
The `` augmented network '' uniquely models all second-order dependencies of the type determiner -noun - X , and determiner -adjective -X ( X ranges over { cl ... cn } ) . 
Augmenting a Hidden Markov Model for Phrase-Dependent Word Tagging
The paper describes refinements that are currently being investigated in a model for part-of-speech assignment to words in unrestricted text.
The model has the advantage that a pre-tagged training corpus is not required.
The determination of part-of-speech categories for words is an important problem in language modeling , because both the syntactic and semantic roles of words depend on their part-of-speech category ( henceforth simply termed `` category '' ) . 
Equivalence classes { Eqvl ... Eqvm } replace the words { wl ... Wv } ( m < < v ) and P ( Eqvi I Ci ) replace the parameters P ( Wi I Ci ) . 
Application areas include speech recognition and information retrieval . 
Several workers have addressed the problem of tagging text . 
Methods have ranged from locally-operating rules ( Greene and Rubin , 1971 ) , to statistical methods ( Church , 1989 ; DeRose , 1988 ; Garside , Leech and Sampson , 1987 ; Jelinek , 1985 ) and back-propagation ( Benello , Mackie and Anderson , 1989 ; Nakamura and Shikano , 1989 ) . 
In this regard , word equivalence classes were used ( Kupiec , 1989 ) . 
The statistical methods can be described in terms of Markov Model .
