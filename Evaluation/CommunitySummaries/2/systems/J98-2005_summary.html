<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>a treebank PCFG whose simple relative frequency estimator corresponds to maximumlikelihood ( Chi and Geman 1998 ) , and which we shall refer to as `` MLPCFG '' . </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Such maximization provides the estimator ( see for instance ( Chi and Geman , 1998 ) ) pG ( A ? a ) =f ( A ? a , T ) f ( A , T ) . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This result been firstly shown in ( Chaudhuri et al. , 1983 ) and later , with a different proof technique , in ( Chi and Geman , 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>( Wetherell and others use the designation `` consistent '' instead of `` tight , '' but in statistics , consistency refers to the asymptotic correctness of an estimator . ) </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We will show that in both cases the estimated probability is tight . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In the simple example here , the estimator converges in one step and is the same ~ as if we had observed the entire parse tree for each wi . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>( We use R in place of the more typical P to avoid confusion with probabilities . ) </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Evidently the likelihood is unaffected by the particular assignment of fi ( B -- ~ fl ) . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Dumpster Laird , and Rubin [ 1977 ] put the idea into a much more general setting and coined the Chi and Geman Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars term EM for Expectation-Maximization . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For each A E V , let F ( A ; w ) be the number of instances of A in w and let F ( A ; w ) be the number of non root instances of A in w. Given oz E ( V U T ) * , let nA ( cZ ) be the number of instances of A in the string o~ , and , finally , let ai be the ith component of the string o~ . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It is reasonable to hope that if the trees in the sample are finite , then an estimate of production probabilities based upon the sample will produce a system that assigns probability zero to the set of infinite trees . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This solves a problem that was left open in the literature ( Chi and Geman,1998 ) </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Proof The proof is almost identical to the one given by Chi and Ceman ( 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>We will show that if f~ is the set of all ( finite ) parse trees generated by G , and if f~ ( ca ) is the probability of ca ff fl under the maximum-likelihood production probabilities , then fi ( f~ ) = 1 . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>What if the production probabilities are estimated from data ? </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>This simple estimator , as shown by Chi and Geman ( 1998 ) , assigns proper production probÂ­ abilities for PCFGs . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Proof Almost identical , except that we use ( 5 ) in place of ( 3 ) and end up with : n E qA EEG_1 [ F ( A ; wi ) -F ( A ; wi ) lw C fly ( w , ) ] ~ 0 . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>impose proper probability distributions on D ( Chi and Geman 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Denote the maximum-likelihood estimator by fi : n B AB q- ~i=lf -- + /3 ; ca ; ) = 0 V ( S ~ /3 ) E R f , ( B +/3 ) Since ~ fi ( B+/3 ) =l ) fl sA . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Computational Linguistics Volume 24 , numbers 2 Wetherell ( 1980 ) has asked a similar question : a scheme ( different from maximum likelihood ) is introduced for estimating productions probability from an unparsed corpus , and it is conjectured that the resulting system is tight . </a></body>
