a treebank PCFG whose simple relative frequency estimator corresponds to maximumlikelihood ( Chi and Geman 1998 ) , and which we shall refer to as `` MLPCFG '' . 
Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm . 
Such maximization provides the estimator ( see for instance ( Chi and Geman , 1998 ) ) pG ( A ? a ) =f ( A ? a , T ) f ( A , T ) . 
This result been firstly shown in ( Chaudhuri et al. , 1983 ) and later , with a different proof technique , in ( Chi and Geman , 1998 ) . 
( Wetherell and others use the designation `` consistent '' instead of `` tight , '' but in statistics , consistency refers to the asymptotic correctness of an estimator . ) 
We will show that in both cases the estimated probability is tight . 
In the simple example here , the estimator converges in one step and is the same ~ as if we had observed the entire parse tree for each wi . 
( We use R in place of the more typical P to avoid confusion with probabilities . ) 
Evidently the likelihood is unaffected by the particular assignment of fi ( B -- ~ fl ) . 
Dumpster Laird , and Rubin [ 1977 ] put the idea into a much more general setting and coined the Chi and Geman Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars term EM for Expectation-Maximization . 
For each A E V , let F ( A ; w ) be the number of instances of A in w and let F ( A ; w ) be the number of non root instances of A in w. Given oz E ( V U T ) * , let nA ( cZ ) be the number of instances of A in the string o~ , and , finally , let ai be the ith component of the string o~ . 
It is reasonable to hope that if the trees in the sample are finite , then an estimate of production probabilities based upon the sample will produce a system that assigns probability zero to the set of infinite trees . 
This solves a problem that was left open in the literature ( Chi and Geman,1998 ) 
Proof The proof is almost identical to the one given by Chi and Ceman ( 1998 ) . 
We will show that if f~ is the set of all ( finite ) parse trees generated by G , and if f~ ( ca ) is the probability of ca ff fl under the maximum-likelihood production probabilities , then fi ( f~ ) = 1 . 
What if the production probabilities are estimated from data ? 
This simple estimator , as shown by Chi and Geman ( 1998 ) , assigns proper production probÂ­ abilities for PCFGs . 
Proof Almost identical , except that we use ( 5 ) in place of ( 3 ) and end up with : n E qA EEG_1 [ F ( A ; wi ) -F ( A ; wi ) lw C fly ( w , ) ] ~ 0 . 
impose proper probability distributions on D ( Chi and Geman 1998 ) . 
Denote the maximum-likelihood estimator by fi : n B AB q- ~i=lf -- + /3 ; ca ; ) = 0 V ( S ~ /3 ) E R f , ( B +/3 ) Since ~ fi ( B+/3 ) =l ) fl sA . 
Computational Linguistics Volume 24 , numbers 2 Wetherell ( 1980 ) has asked a similar question : a scheme ( different from maximum likelihood ) is introduced for estimating productions probability from an unparsed corpus , and it is conjectured that the resulting system is tight .
