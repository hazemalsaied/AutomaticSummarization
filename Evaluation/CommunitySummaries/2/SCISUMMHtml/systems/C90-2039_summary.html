<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Ile proposed an incremental copy graph unification method to avoid over copying and early copying . </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In tile directed graph notation , TFS unification corresponds to graph merging . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Other versions based on more efficient graph unification methods such as Wroblewski 's and Kogure 's method [ 23 , 16 ] have also been developed . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example , in Kasper 's disjunctive feature description unification , a definite part [ `` S is larger than a disjunct definite part t '' S . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This order is related to the unification failure tendency . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>in the learning process , when FS unification is applied , feature treatment orders are randomized for the sake of random extraction . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>However , Pereira 's method can create skeleton-enviromnent structures that are deeply embedded , for example , in recursively constructing large phrase structure floor their parts . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The other, called ti~e strategic incremental copy graph unification method, uses an early failure finding strategy which first tries to unify ;ubstructures tending to fail in unification; this method is; based on stochastic data on tim likelihood of failure and ,'educes unnecessary computation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For ordinary FSs , unification is defined by using partial ordering based on consumption relationships . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>When a NODE node 1 has a NODE node 2 as its FORWARD value , the other contents of tile node 1 are ignored and tim contents of node 2 are used . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Output graph G3 Figure 5 : Incremental copy graph unification In this figure , type symbols are omitted . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Various kinds of grammatical formalisms without t , transformation were proposed from the late 1970s I ; rough the 1980s l ( ] aider al 85 , l ( plan and Bresnan 82 , Kay 1~5 , Pollm 'd and Sag 871 . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Therefore , Pereira 's method needs relatively few new structures when two input FSs are difference in size and which input is larger are known before unification . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The strategic lazy incremental copy graph ( SLING ) unification method combines two incremental copy graph unification methods : the lazy incremental copy graph ( LING ) unification method and the strategic incremental copy graph ( SING ) unification method . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>FOR ALL arc IN nodes DO IF NotNIL ? ( new arc FindArc ( archangel new arcs ) THEN AddArc ( new node Newark undervalue . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>With such a method , it is possible to delay copying a node until either its own contents need to change ( e.g. , node G3/Ka c ! 7 > ) or until it is found to have an arc ( sequence ) to a node t , hat needs to be copied ( e.g. , node X G3/ < a c > in Fig . </a>

<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>AddArc ( out node complementary new node . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>In such cases , application of the EFF strategy , that is , treating feature tending to fall in Unification first , reduces unnecessary computation when the Unification finally fails . </a></body>
