<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Recent work has motivated the need for systems that support Information Synthesis tasks , in which user seeks a global understanding of a topic story Amigo et al. , 2004 ) . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Presently , we introduce topic-sensitive LexRank in creating sentence retrieval system . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>While evaluations of question answering systems are often based on a shorter list of ranked sentences we chose to generate longer lists for several reasons . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In contrast to the classical question answering setting ( e.g . TREC-style Q & A ( Voorhees and Tice , 2000 ) ) , in which the user presents a single question and the system returns corresponding answer ( or a set of likely answers ) , in this case the user has a more complex information . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Therefore , there is often more than one correct answer to a question.We aim to develop a method for sentence retrieval that goes beyond finding sentences that are similar to a single query . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In the graph each node represents a sentence . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However , a small probability for jumping to a node that is lexically similar to the given sentence ( rather than the question itself is needed . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Below , we describe a topic-sensitive version of LexRank , which is more appropriate for the question-focusedsentence retrieval problem . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Similarly , when reading about a complex news story such as an emergency situation , users might seek answers to a set of questions in order to understand it better . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Our goal is to build a question-focused sentence retrieval mechanism using a topic-sensitive version of the method . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In the training phase the experiment , we evaluated all combination with d in the range of [ 0 , 1 ] ( in increments of 0.10 ) and with a similarity threshold ranging from [ 0 , 0.9 ] ( in increments of 0.05 ) . </a>
