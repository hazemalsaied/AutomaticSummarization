<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This approach is similar in spirit to the iterative computational approaches of the Hidden Markov Models ( Kupiec , 1989 </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Basic Model The development of the model was guided by evaluation against a simple basic model ( much of the development of the model was prompted by an analysis of the errors in its behavior . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This has the disadvantage that they can not share training data . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The former represents 95.6 % correct word tagging on the text as a whole ( ignoring unknown words ) , and 89 % on the ambiguous words . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A 30,000 word dictionary was used , supplemented by inflectional analysis for words not found directly in the dictionary . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To model such dependency across the phrase , the networks shown in Figure 2 can be used . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In the 21 category model reported in Kupiec ( 1989 ) only 129 equivalence classes were required to cover a 30,000 word dictionary . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The most frequent 100 words of the corpus were assigned individually in the model , thereby enabling them to have different distributions over their categories . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In the document , 142 words were tagged as unknown ( their possible categories were not known ) . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This work was sponsored in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DOD ) , under the Information Science and Technology Office , contract # N0014086-C-8996 . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Editing the Transition Structure A common error in the basic model was the assignment of the word `` to '' to the to-infcategory ( `` to '' acting as an infinitive marker ) instead of preposition before noun phrases . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Methods have ranged from locally-operating rules ( Greene and Rubin , 1971 ) , to statistical methods ( Church , 1989 ; DeRose , 1988 ; Garside , Leech and Sampson , 1987 ; Jelinek , 1985 ) and back-propagation ( Benello , Mackie and Anderson , 1989 ; Nakamura and Shikano , 1989 ) . </a></body>
