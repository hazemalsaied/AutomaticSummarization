<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>a treebank PCFG whose simple relative frequency estimator corresponds to maximumlikelihood ( Chi and Geman 1998 ) , and which we shall refer to as `` MLPCFG '' . </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Letting ~y denote { w Efk Y ( w ) = Y } , the likelihood of the corpus becomes n H E H P ( A -- '~oL ) f ( A~ ; ~ ) '' i=1 ~OE~y ( ~i ) ( A -- -~o~ ) ER And the maximum-likelihood equation becomes + p ( B fl ) Ei=l EwEfly ( wi , I-I ( A -- . ) cR p ( A -~ a ) f ( A-~ '' ; ~ ) = 0 fT ( B ~ /3 ) = ~iL1 Ep~f ( B ~ fl ; w ) lw E ~y ( ~ , ) ] ( 4 ) , ~s , , , ~Ei=IEpV ( `` a ; w ) lw E ~Y ( o~ , ) ] E ( B_~ , E B ~ where E~ is expectation under fi and where `` ] w E~-~y ( wi ) '' means `` conditioned on 0.2E ~-~Y ( wi ) ' '' There is no hope for a closed form solution , but ( 4 ) does suggest an iteration scheme , which , as it turns out , `` climbs '' the likelihood surface ( though there are no guarantees about approaching a global maximum ) : Let P0 be an arbitrary assignment respecting ( 1 ) . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Such maximization provides the estimator ( see for instance ( Chi and Geman , 1998 ) ) pG ( A ? a ) =f ( A ? a , T ) f ( A , T ) . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This result been firstly shown in ( Chaudhuri et al. , 1983 ) and later , with a different proof technique , in ( Chi and Geman , 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>( Wetherell and others use the designation `` consistent '' instead of `` tight , '' but in statistics , consistency refers to the asymptotic correctness of an estimator . ) </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We will show that in both cases the estimated probability is tight . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Let Sh be the total probability of all trees with depth less than or equal to h. For example , $ 2 = q corresponding to A ~ a , and $ 3 = q + pq2 corresponding to { A ~ a } tO { A ~ AA , A -- ~ a , A -- ~ a } . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Furthermore , it is not hard to see that any such B has probability zero of arising in any derivation that is based upon the maximum-likelihood probabilities hence the issue of tightness is independent of this assignment . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Blum 1972 ] first introduced it for hidden Markov models ( regular grammars ) and Baker [ 1979 ] extended it to the problem addressed here ( estimation for context-free grammars ) . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Proof The proof is almost identical to the one given by Chi and Ceman ( 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This solves a problem that was left open in the literature ( Chi and Geman,1998 ) </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For each A E V , let F ( A ; w ) be the number of instances of A in w and let F ( A ; w ) be the number of non root instances of A in w. Given oz E ( V U T ) * , let nA ( cZ ) be the number of instances of A in the string o~ , and , finally , let ai be the ith component of the string o~ . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>impose proper probability distributions on D ( Chi and Geman 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Dumpster Laird , and Rubin [ 1977 ] put the idea into a much more general setting and coined the Chi and Geman Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars term EM for Expectation-Maximization . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>What if the production probabilities are estimated from data ? </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>In the usual way , probabilities are introduced through the productions : P : R -- ~ [ 0,1 ] such that VA E V : p ( A -~ c~ ) = 1 . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>This simple estimator , as shown by Chi and Geman ( 1998 ) , assigns proper production probÂ­ abilities for PCFGs . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Proof Almost identical , except that we use ( 5 ) in place of ( 3 ) and end up with : n E qA EEG_1 [ F ( A ; wi ) -F ( A ; wi ) lw C fly ( w , ) ] ~ 0 . </a>

<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>In the simple example here , the estimator converges in one step and is the same ~ as if we had observed the entire parse tree for each wi . </a></body>
