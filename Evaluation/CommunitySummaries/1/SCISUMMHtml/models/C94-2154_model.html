<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The practical effect of this is that Troll implements an exhaustive typing strategy which provides the stronger kind of inferencing over descriptions ( Gerdemann and King , 1993 , 1994 ) required by standard HPSG theories . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By contrast , the Troll system described in this paper has an effective algorithm f < > r deciding well-formedness , which is based on the idea of efficiently representing disjunctive possibilities within the feature structure , Call a well-typed feature structure in which all nodes are labeled with species a resolved feature structure and call a set of resolved feature structures that have the same underlying graph ( that is , they differ only in their node labellings ) a disjunctive resolved feature structure . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We write fS , ~vf8 and 'D~ . ) c $ for the collections of feature structures , resolved feature structures and disjunctive resolved feature structures respectively . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Say that F'E RFS is a resolved of F E FS iff F and F ' have the same underlying graph and F subsumes F ' . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Let type resolution be the total function R : - > DRFS such that R ( F ) is the set of all resolved of F. Guided by the partition and all-or-nothing conditions , King [ 13 ] has formulated a semantics of feature structures and developed a notion of a satisfiable feature structure such that F E FS is satisfiable iff R ( F ) 0 . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>C , erdemann , % King [ 8 ] have also shown that a feature structure l ] lets all encoded FCRs ifl '' the feature structure is satisfiable . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The Troll system , which is based on this idea , effectively implements type resolution . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>APPROPRIATENES S CONDITIONS A very important property of the class of DRFS is that they are closed under unification , i.e. , if F and F'E DRFS then F U F ' E DRFS.4 Given this property , it would in principle he possible to use the disjunctive resolved feature structures in an implementation without any additional type inferencing procedure to maintain satisfiability . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It would , of course , not be very efficient to work with such large disjunctions of feature structures . </a></body>
