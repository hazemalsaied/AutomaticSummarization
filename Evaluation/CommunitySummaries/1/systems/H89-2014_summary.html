<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>State chains are used to model selective higher-order conditioning in the model , which obviates the proliferation of parameters attendant in uniformly higher-order models . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this regard , word equivalence classes were used ( Kupiec , 1989 ) . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In a ranked list of words in the corpus the most frequent 100 words account for approximately 50 % of the total tokens in the corpus , and thus data is available to estimate them reliably . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The Basic Model The development of the model was guided by evaluation against a simple basic model ( much of the development of the model was prompted by an analysis of the errors in its behavior . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>1 It is easy to construct counterexamples to the sentences presented here , where the tagging would be correct . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A 30,000 word dictionary was used , supplemented by inflectional analysis for words not found directly in the dictionary . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Methods have ranged from locally-operating rules ( Greene and Rubin , 1971 ) , to statistical methods ( Church , 1989 ; DeRose , 1988 ; Garside , Leech and Sampson , 1987 ; Jelinek , 1985 ) and back-propagation ( Benello , Mackie and Anderson , 1989 ; Nakamura and Shikano , 1989 ) . </a></body>
