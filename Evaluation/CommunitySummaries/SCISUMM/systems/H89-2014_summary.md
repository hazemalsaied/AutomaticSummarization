This approach is similar in spirit to the iterative computational approaches of the Hidden Markov Models ( Kupiec , 1989 
ADJECTIVE DETERMINER To all states NOUN in Basic Network `` Transitions to Â• To all states all states in in Basic Network Basic Network except NOUN and ADJECTIVE AUGMENTED NETWORK BASIC NETWORK FULLY-CONNECTED NETWORK CONTAINING ALL STATES EXCEPT DETERMINER Figure 1 : Extending the Basic Model Augmenting the Model by Use of Networks The basic model consists of a first-order fully connected network . 
This has the disadvantage that they can not share training data . 
The paper describes refinements that are currently being investigated in a model for part-of-speech assignment to words in unrestricted text.

State chains are used to model selective higher-order conditioning in the model , which obviates the proliferation of parameters attendant in uniformly higher-order models . 
In this regard , word equivalence classes were used ( Kupiec , 1989 ) . 
In a ranked list of words in the corpus the most frequent 100 words account for approximately 50 % of the total tokens in the corpus , and thus data is available to estimate them reliably . 
The Basic Model The development of the model was guided by evaluation against a simple basic model ( much of the development of the model was prompted by an analysis of the errors in its behavior . 
1 It is easy to construct counterexamples to the sentences presented here , where the tagging would be correct . 
A 30,000 word dictionary was used , supplemented by inflectional analysis for words not found directly in the dictionary . 
Methods have ranged from locally-operating rules ( Greene and Rubin , 1971 ) , to statistical methods ( Church , 1989 ; DeRose , 1988 ; Garside , Leech and Sampson , 1987 ; Jelinek , 1985 ) and back-propagation ( Benello , Mackie and Anderson , 1989 ; Nakamura and Shikano , 1989 ) .
