Ile proposed an incremental copy graph unification method to avoid over copying and early copying . 
In tile directed graph notation , TFS unification corresponds to graph merging . 
Other versions based on more efficient graph unification methods such as Wroblewski 's and Kogure 's method [ 23 , 16 ] have also been developed . 
For example , in Kasper 's disjunctive feature description unification , a definite part [ `` S is larger than a disjunct definite part t '' S . 
This order is related to the unification failure tendency . 
Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification
in the learning process , when FS unification is applied , feature treatment orders are randomized for the sake of random extraction . 
However , Pereira 's method can create skeleton-enviromnent structures that are deeply embedded , for example , in recursively constructing large phrase structure floor their parts . 
The other, called ti~e strategic incremental copy graph unification method, uses an early failure finding strategy which first tries to unify ;ubstructures tending to fail in unification; this method is; based on stochastic data on tim likelihood of failure and ,'educes unnecessary computation.
For ordinary FSs , unification is defined by using partial ordering based on consumption relationships . 
When a NODE node 1 has a NODE node 2 as its FORWARD value , the other contents of tile node 1 are ignored and tim contents of node 2 are used .

Various kinds of grammatical formalisms without t , transformation were proposed from the late 1970s I ; rough the 1980s l ( ] aider al 85 , l ( plan and Bresnan 82 , Kay 1~5 , Pollm 'd and Sag 871 . 
Therefore , Pereira 's method needs relatively few new structures when two input FSs are difference in size and which input is larger are known before unification . 
The strategic lazy incremental copy graph ( SLING ) unification method combines two incremental copy graph unification methods : the lazy incremental copy graph ( LING ) unification method and the strategic incremental copy graph ( SING ) unification method . 
Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying . 
FOR ALL arc IN nodes DO IF NotNIL ? ( new arc FindArc ( archangel new arcs ) THEN AddArc ( new node Newark undervalue . 
With such a method , it is possible to delay copying a node until either its own contents need to change ( e.g. , node G3/Ka c ! 7 > ) or until it is found to have an arc ( sequence ) to a node t , hat needs to be copied ( e.g. , node X G3/ < a c > in Fig . 
node 2 Dereferencelnode2 ) . 
AddArc ( out node complementary new node . 
In such cases , application of the EFF strategy , that is , treating feature tending to fall in Unification first , reduces unnecessary computation when the Unification finally fails .
