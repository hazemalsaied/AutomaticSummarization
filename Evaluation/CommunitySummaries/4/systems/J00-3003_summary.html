<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>( Stolcke et al. , 2000 ) use HMMs for dialogue modelling , where sequences of observations correspond to sequences of dialog act types . </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>They also explore the performance with decision trees and neural networks and report their highest accuracy at 65 % on the Switchboard corpus . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To date , the majority of work on dialog act modeling has addressed spoken dialogue ( Samuel et al. , 1998 ; Stolcke et al. , 2000 ; Surendran and Levow , 2006 ; Bangalore et al. , 2008 ; Sridhar et al. , 2009 ; Di Eugenio et al. , 2010 ) . </a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We have developed an integrated probabilistic approach to dialog act modeling for conversational speech , and tested it on a large speech corpus . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Conversational feedback is mostly performance short utterances such as yeah , mh , okay produced by the main speaker but by one of the other participants of a conversation . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Such utterances are among the most frequent in conversational data ( Stolcke et al. , 2000 ) . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Finally , DA types themselves are assumed to be independent beyond a short span ( corresponding to the order of the dialog ) . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Dialog act ( DA ) annotations and tagging , inspired by the speech act theory of Austin ( 1975 ) and Searle ( 1976 ) , have been used in the NLP community to understand and model dialog . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Initial work was done unspoken interactions ( see for example ( Stolcke et al.,2000 ) ) . </a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>As discussed in Section 8 , this problem is best addressed by joint lexical-prosodic models . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The HMM terminology was chosen here mainly for historical reasons.. </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Figure 1 shows the variables in the resulting HMM with directed edges representing conditional dependence . </a>

<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>By representing a higher level intention of utterance human conversation , dialog act labels are being used to enrich the information provided spoken words ( Stolcke et al. , 2000 ) . </a></body>
