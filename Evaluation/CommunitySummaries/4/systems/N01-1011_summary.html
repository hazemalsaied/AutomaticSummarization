<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We believe that the approach in this paper is the ? rst time that decision trees based strictly on digram features have been employed . </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Learning continues until all the training examples are accounted for by the decision tree . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The most dramatic difference occurred with amaze-v , where the SENSE- VAL average was 92.4 % and the decision tree accuracy was 58.6 % . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In light of this , ( Pedersen , 1996 ) presents Fisher 's exact test as an alternative since it does not rely on the distributional assumptions that underly both Pearson 's test and the likelihood ratio . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>There is a further assumption that each feature is conditionally independent of all other features , given the sense of the ambiguous word . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Each sense { tagged occurrence of an ambiguous word is converted into a feature vector , where each feature represents some property of the surrounding text that is considered to be relevant to the disambiguation process . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>These typically include the part { of { speech of surrounding words , the presence of certain key words within some window of context , and various syntactic properties of the sentence and the ambiguous word . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Decision trees are among the most widely used machine learning algorithms . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The following process is repeated for each task . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A preliminary version of this paper appears in ( Pedersen , 2001 ) . </a></body>
