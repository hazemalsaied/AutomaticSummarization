A unification example is shown in Fig . 
In tile directed graph notation , TFS unification corresponds to graph merging . 
Other versions based on more efficient graph unification methods such as Wroblewski 's and Kogure 's method [ 23 , 16 ] have also been developed . 
For example , in Kasper 's disjunctive feature description unification , a definite part [ `` S is larger than a disjunct definite part t '' S . 
Japanese analysis system based on llPSG [ Kogure 891 uses 90 % - 98 % of the elapsed time in FS unification . 
Various kinds of grammatical formalisms without t , transformation were proposed from the late 1970s I ; rough the 1980s l ( ] aider al 85 , l ( plan and Bresnan 82 , Kay 1~5 , Pollm 'd and Sag 871 . 
These formalisms were applied in the field of natural language processing and , based on these formalisms , ~ : systems such as machine translation systems were developed [ l < ol ; u , e et a l 8gJ . 
After the process finishes , all COPY slot values are ignored and thus original structures are not destroyed . 
In Section 5 , a method which uses this generalized strategy is proposed . 
That is , unless some new scheme for reducing excessive copying is introduced such as scucture-sharing of an unchanged shared-forest ( [ Kogure , 1990 ] ) . 
This causes O ( log d ) graph node access time overhead in assembling the whole DG from the skeleton and environments where d is the number of nodes in the DG . 
however the problem with his method is that a unification result graph consists only of newly created structures . 
Previous research identified DG copying as a significant overhead . 
Ferreira structure sharing FS unification method can avoid this problem . 
Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification
Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying . 
The node specified by the feature path < a > ficos input graph G1 ( Gl/ < a > ) has an arc with the label c and the corresponding node of input graph G2 does not . 
It substitutes arcs with newly copied nodes for existing arcs . 
node 2 Dereferencelnode2 ) . 
endoscopy new node . 
This orders is related to the Unification failure tendencies .
