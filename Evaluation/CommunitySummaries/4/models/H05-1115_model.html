<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our goal is to build a question-focused sentence retrieval mechanism using a topic-sensitive version ofthe LexRank method . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The output of our system , a ranked list of sentences relevant to the user question , can be subsequently used as input to an answer selection system in order to find specific answers from the extracted sentences . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Alternatively , the sentences cane returned to the user as a question-focused summary . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To apply LexRank , a similarity graph is produce the sentences in an input document set . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In thegraph , each node represents a sentence . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>There are edges between nodes for which the cosine similarity between the respective pair of sentences exceeds given threshold . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The degree of a given node Isa indication of how much information the respective sentence has in common with other sentences . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In topic-sensitive LexRank , we first stem all of the sentences in a set of articles and compute word IDFsby the following formula : </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In a Web-based news summarization setting , users of our system could choose to see the retrieved sentences ( sin Table 9 ) as a question-focused summary . </a></body>
