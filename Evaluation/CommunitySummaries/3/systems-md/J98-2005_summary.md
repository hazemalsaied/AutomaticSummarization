a treebank PCFG whose simple relative frequency estimator corresponds to maximumlikelihood ( Chi and Geman 1998 ) , and which we shall refer to as `` MLPCFG '' . 
Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm . 
Such maximization provides the estimator ( see for instance ( Chi and Geman , 1998 ) ) pG ( A ? a ) =f ( A ? a , T ) f ( A , T ) . 
This result been firstly shown in ( Chaudhuri et al. , 1983 ) and later , with a different proof technique , in ( Chi and Geman , 1998 ) . 
( Wetherell and others use the designation `` consistent '' instead of `` tight , '' but in statistics , consistency refers to the asymptotic correctness of an estimator . ) 
impose proper probability distributions on D ( Chi and Geman 1998 ) . 
In the simple example here , the estimator converges in one step and is the same ~ as if we had observed the entire parse tree for each wi . 
We will show that in both cases the estimated probability is tight . 
Evidently the likelihood is unaffected by the particular assignment of fi ( B -- ~ fl ) . 
Dumpster Laird , and Rubin [ 1977 ] put the idea into a much more general setting and coined the Chi and Geman Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars term EM for Expectation-Maximization . 
Blum 1972 ] first introduced it for hidden Markov models ( regular grammars ) and Baker [ 1979 ] extended it to the problem addressed here ( estimation for context-free grammars ) . 
This solves a problem that was left open in the literature ( Chi and Geman,1998 ) 
Proof The proof is almost identical to the one given by Chi and Ceman ( 1998 ) . 
This simple estimator , as shown by Chi and Geman ( 1998 ) , assigns proper production probÂ­ abilities for PCFGs . 
What if the production probabilities are estimated from data ? 
Assign probability p to the first production ( A ~ AA ) and q = 1 -p to the second ( A ~ a ) . 
Each production in R has the form A ~ oL , where A E V and o~ E ( VUT ) * . 
Proof Almost identical , except that we use ( 5 ) in place of ( 3 ) and end up with : n E qA EEG_1 [ F ( A ; wi ) -F ( A ; wi ) lw C fly ( w , ) ] ~ 0 . 
( We use R in place of the more typical P to avoid confusion with probabilities . )
