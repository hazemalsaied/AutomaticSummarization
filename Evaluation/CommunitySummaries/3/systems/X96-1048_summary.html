<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Systems scored approximately 1525 points lower ( F-measure ) on ST than on TE . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Frequently , at least one can be found in close proximity to an organization 's name , e.g. , as an appositive ( `` Creative Artists Agency , the big Hollywood talent agency '' ) . </a>
