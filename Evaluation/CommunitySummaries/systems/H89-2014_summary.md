This approach is similar in spirit to the iterative computational approaches of the Hidden Markov Models ( Kupiec , 1989

The Basic Model The development of the model was guided by evaluation against a simple basic model ( much of the development of the model was prompted by an analysis of the errors in its behavior . 
This has the disadvantage that they can not share training data . 
Only context has been supplied to aid the training procedure , and the latter is responsible for deciding which alternative is more likely , based on the training data . 
A pre-tagged training corpus is not required , and the tagger can cope with words not found in the training text . 
The paper describes refinements that are currently being investigated in a model for part-of-speech assignment to words in unrestricted text.

To model such dependency across the phrase , the networks shown in Figure 2 can be used . 
State chains are used to model selective higher-order conditioning in the model , which obviates the proliferation of parameters attendant in uniformly higher-order models . 
In this regard , word equivalence classes were used ( Kupiec , 1989 ) . 
In the 21 category model reported in Kupiec ( 1989 ) only 129 equivalence classes were required to cover a 30,000 word dictionary . 
In a ranked list of words in the corpus the most frequent 100 words account for approximately 50 % of the total tokens in the corpus , and thus data is available to estimate them reliably . 
The former represents 95.6 % correct word tagging on the text as a whole ( ignoring unknown words ) , and 89 % on the ambiguous words . 
The basic model tagged these sentences correctly , except for- `` range '' and `` rises '' which were tagged as noun and plural-noun respectively 1 . 
Critical examination of the tagging provided by the augmented model showed 168 word tagging errors , whereas the basic model gave 215 erroneous word tags . 
In fact , the number of equivalence classes is essentially independent of the size of the dictionary , enabling new words to be added without any modification to the model . 
A 30,000 word dictionary was used , supplemented by inflectional analysis for words not found directly in the dictionary . 
Methods have ranged from locally-operating rules ( Greene and Rubin , 1971 ) , to statistical methods ( Church , 1989 ; DeRose , 1988 ; Garside , Leech and Sampson , 1987 ; Jelinek , 1985 ) and back-propagation ( Benello , Mackie and Anderson , 1989 ; Nakamura and Shikano , 1989 ) . 
It would be appropriate to deal with idioms separately , as done by Gaxside , Leech and Sampson ( 1987 ) .
