Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying . 
ENDIF ENDIE ENDPROCEDURE Figure 6 : Incremental copy graph unification procedure The problem with Wroblewski 's method is that tile whole result DG is created by using only newly created structures . 
Other versions based on more efficient graph unification methods such as Wroblewski 's and Kogure 's method [ 23 , 16 ] have also been developed . 
Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification
These formalisms were developed relatively independentIy but actually had common properties ; theft is , they used data structures called frictional structures or feature structures and they were based on underneath operation on these data structures . 
Various kinds of grammatical formalisms without t , transformation were proposed from the late 1970s I ; rough the 1980s l ( ] aider al 85 , l ( plan and Bresnan 82 , Kay 1~5 , Pollm 'd and Sag 871 . 
These formalisms were applied in the field of natural language processing and , based on these formalisms , ~ : systems such as machine translation systems were developed [ l < ol ; u , e et a l 8gJ . 
has as its value a TFS which is not less than its counterpart in tl ; and each of the dereference relationships in t2 is also held in tl . 
That is , unless some new scheme for reducing excessive copying is introduced such as scucture-sharing of an unchanged shared-forest ( [ Kogure , 1990 ] ) . 
Kowalewski claims that copying is wrong when an algorithm copies too much ( over copying ) or copies too soon ( early copying ) .

In this paper , some of the efficiency of the procedure- based system is introduced into an FS unification-based system . 
 3'he skeleton part is shared by one of the input FSs and the result FS . 
The other, called ti~e strategic incremental copy graph unification method, uses an early failure finding strategy which first tries to unify ;ubstructures tending to fail in unification; this method is; based on stochastic data on tim likelihood of failure and ,'educes unnecessary computation.
