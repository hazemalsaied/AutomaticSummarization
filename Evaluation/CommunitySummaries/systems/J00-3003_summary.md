( Stolcke et al. , 2000 ) use HMMs for dialogue modelling , where sequences of observations correspond to sequences of dialog act types . 
They also explore the performance with decision trees and neural networks and report their highest accuracy at 65 % on the Switchboard corpus . 
To date , the majority of work on dialog act modeling has addressed spoken dialogue ( Samuel et al. , 1998 ; Stolcke et al. , 2000 ; Surendran and Levow , 2006 ; Bangalore et al. , 2008 ; Sridhar et al. , 2009 ; Di Eugenio et al. , 2010 ) . 
2.3 Major Dialogue Act Types . 
Our primary purpose in adapting the tag set was to enable computational DA modeling for conversational speech , with possible improvements to conversational speech recognition . 
Conversational feedback is mostly performance short utterances such as yeah , mh , okay produced by the main speaker but by one of the other participants of a conversation . 
Such utterances are among the most frequent in conversational data ( Stolcke et al. , 2000 ) . 
Similarly , we find distinctive correlations between certain phrases and DA types . 
Dialog act ( DA ) annotations and tagging , inspired by the speech act theory of Austin ( 1975 ) and Searle ( 1976 ) , have been used in the NLP community to understand and model dialog . 
Initial work was done unspoken interactions ( see for example ( Stolcke et al.,2000 ) ) . 
Dialogue Act Modeling for Automatic Tagging and Recognition of Conversational Speech
The word insertion penalty represents a correction to the language model that allows balancing insertion and deletion errors . 
The importance of the Markov assumption for the discourse grammar is that we can now view the whole system of discourse grammar and local utterance-based likelihoods as a kth-order hidden Markov model ( HMM ) ( Rabiner and Juang 1986 ) . 
Second , we present results obtained with this approach on a large , widely available corpus of spontaneous conversational speech . 
Table 2 The 42 dialog act labels . 
By representing a higher level intention of utterance human conversation , dialog act labels are being used to enrich the information provided spoken words ( Stolcke et al. , 2000 ) .
