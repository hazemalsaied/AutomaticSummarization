<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Basic Model The development of the model was guided by evaluation against a simple basic model ( much of the development of the model was prompted by an analysis of the errors in its behavior . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This has the disadvantage that they can not share training data . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Only context has been supplied to aid the training procedure , and the latter is responsible for deciding which alternative is more likely , based on the training data . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A pre-tagged training corpus is not required , and the tagger can cope with words not found in the training text . </a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>To model such dependency across the phrase , the networks shown in Figure 2 can be used . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>State chains are used to model selective higher-order conditioning in the model , which obviates the proliferation of parameters attendant in uniformly higher-order models . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In this regard , word equivalence classes were used ( Kupiec , 1989 ) . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In the 21 category model reported in Kupiec ( 1989 ) only 129 equivalence classes were required to cover a 30,000 word dictionary . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In a ranked list of words in the corpus the most frequent 100 words account for approximately 50 % of the total tokens in the corpus , and thus data is available to estimate them reliably . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The former represents 95.6 % correct word tagging on the text as a whole ( ignoring unknown words ) , and 89 % on the ambiguous words . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The basic model tagged these sentences correctly , except for- `` range '' and `` rises '' which were tagged as noun and plural-noun respectively 1 . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Critical examination of the tagging provided by the augmented model showed 168 word tagging errors , whereas the basic model gave 215 erroneous word tags . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In fact , the number of equivalence classes is essentially independent of the size of the dictionary , enabling new words to be added without any modification to the model . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>A 30,000 word dictionary was used , supplemented by inflectional analysis for words not found directly in the dictionary . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Methods have ranged from locally-operating rules ( Greene and Rubin , 1971 ) , to statistical methods ( Church , 1989 ; DeRose , 1988 ; Garside , Leech and Sampson , 1987 ; Jelinek , 1985 ) and back-propagation ( Benello , Mackie and Anderson , 1989 ; Nakamura and Shikano , 1989 ) . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>It would be appropriate to deal with idioms separately , as done by Gaxside , Leech and Sampson ( 1987 ) . </a></body>
