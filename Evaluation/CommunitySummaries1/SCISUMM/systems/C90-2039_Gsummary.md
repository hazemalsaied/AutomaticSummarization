A unification example is shown in Fig . 
Japanese analysis system based on llPSG [ Kogure 891 uses 90 % - 98 % of the elapsed time in FS unification . 
Section 3 explains a TFS unification method based on Wroblewski 's method and then explains the problem with his method . 
This order is related to the unification failure tendency . 
Various kinds of grammatical formalisms without t , transformation were proposed from the late 1970s I ; rough the 1980s l ( ] aider al 85 , l ( plan and Bresnan 82 , Kay 1~5 , Pollm 'd and Sag 871 . 
These formalisms were applied in the field of natural language processing and , based on these formalisms , ~ : systems such as machine translation systems were developed [ l < ol ; u , e et a l 8gJ . 
The LING unification procedure uses a revised CopyNode procedure which does not copy structures immediately . 
Previous research identified DG copying as a significant overhead . 
This causes O ( log d ) graph node access time overhead in assembling the whole DG from the skeleton and environments where d is the number of nodes in the DG . 
These unification failure tendencies depend on systems such as analysis systems or generation systems . 
Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying . 
however the problem with his method is that a unification result graph consists only of newly created structures . 
Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification
Memory is wasted by such redundant copying and this causes frequent garbage collection and page swapping which decrease the total system efficiency . 
Kowalewski claims that copying is wrong when an algorithm copies too much ( over copying ) or copies too soon ( early copying ) . 
For example , in Kasper 's disjunctive feature description Unification , a definite part [ `` S is larger than a disjunct definite part t '' S .
