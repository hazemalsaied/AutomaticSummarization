They perform a general to spec c search of a feature space , adding the most informative features to a tree structure as the search proceeds . 
The objective is to select a minimal set of features that e√Üciently partitions the feature space into classes of observations and assemble them into a tree . 
A decision stump is a one node decision tree ( Holte , 1993 ) that is created by stopping the decision tree learner after the single most informative feature is added to the tree . 
A Decision Tree of Bigrams is an Accurate Predictor of Word Sense
This paper presents a corpus-based approach to word sense disambiguation where a decision tree assigns a sense to an ambiguous word based on the bigrams that occur nearby.
This approach is evaluated using the sense-tagged corpora from the 1998 SENSEVAL word sense disambiguation exercise . 
In general the total context available for each ambiguous word is less than 100 surrounding words . 
Word sense disambiguation is the process of selecting the most appropriate meaning for a word , based on the context in which it occurs . 
We included all 36 tasks from SENSEVAL for which training and test data were provided . 
For our purposes it is assumed that the set of possible meaning , i.e . , the Sense inventory , has already been determined .
