<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Using Random Walks for Question-focused Sentence Retrieval</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Recent work has motivated the need for systems that support Information Synthesis tasks , in which user seeks a global understanding of a topic story Amigo et al. , 2004 ) . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We evaluate its performance against a competitive baseline , which considers the similarity between each sentence and the question using IDF-weighed word overlap ) . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We presented topic-sensitive LexRank and applied it to the problem of sentence retrieval . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In the new approach , the 916 score of a sentence is determined by a mixture model of the relevance of the sentence to the query and the similarity of the sentence to other high-scoring sentences . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The baseline system explained above does not make use of any inter-sentence information in a cluster.We hypothesize that a sentence that is similar to the high scoring sentences in the cluster should also a high score . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Graph Figure 2 : LexRank example : sentence similarity graph with a cosine threshold of 0.15 . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The idea behind using LexRank for sentence retrieval is that a system that considers only the similarity between candidate sentences and the input and not the similarity between the candidate sentences themselves , is likely to miss some important sentences . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Out of the 72 questions in the set , the baseline system outperformed LexRank on 22 of the questions . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It should be noted that both for the LexRank and baseline systems , chronological ordering of the documents sentence is preserved , such that in cases where two sentences have the same score , the one published is ranked higher . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In contrast to the classical question answering setting ( e.g . TREC-style Q & A ( Voorhees and Tice , 2000 ) ) , in which the user presents a single question and the system returns corresponding answer ( or a set of likely answers ) , in this case the user has a more complex information . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Similarly , when reading about a complex news story such as an emergency situation , users might seek answers to a set of questions in order to understand it better . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>For example , Figure 1 shows the interface to our Web-based news summarization systems which a user has queried for information about Hurricane Isabel . </a></body>
