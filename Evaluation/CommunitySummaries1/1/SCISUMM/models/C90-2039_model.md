Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification 
The other , called tie strategic incremental copy graph unification method , uses an early failure finding strategy which first tries to unify : ; substructures tending to fail in unification ; this method is ; based on stochastic data on tim likelihood of failure and , educes unnecessary computation . 
For example , a spoken Present . 
Japanese analysis system based on llPSG [ Kogure 891 uses 90 % - 98 % of the elapsed time in FS unification . 
itowever , the problem with his method is that a unification result graph consists only of newly created structures . 
This is unnecessary because there are often input subgraphs that can be used as part of the result graph without any modification , or as sharable parts between one of the input graphs and the result graph . 
Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying . 
A better method would minimize the copying of sharable arts . 
A better method would minimize the copying of sharable arts . 
This paper proposes an FS unification method that allows structure sharing with constant moder node access time . 
This method achieves structure sharing by introducing lazy copying to Wroblewski 's incremental copy graph unification method . 
Then , the unification of tl anti t2 is defined as their greatest lower bound or the meet . 
5 disables structure sharing , ttowever , this whole copying is not necessary if a lazy evaluation method is used . 
With such a method , it is possible to delay copying a node until either its own contents need to change ( e.g. , node G3/Ka c ! 7 > ) or until it is found to have an arc ( sequence ) to a node t , hat needs to be copied ( e.g. , node X G3/ < a c > in Fig . 
in this method , theretbre , the failure tendency information is acquired by a learning process . 
That is , the SING unification method applied in an analysis system uses the failure tendency information acquired by a learning analysis process . 
in the learning process , when FS unification is applied , feature treatment orders are randomized for the sake of random extraction . 
The LING unification method achieves structure sharing without the O ( log d ) data access overhead of Pereira 's method . 
Furthermore , structure sharing increases the portion of token identical substructures of FSs which makes it efficient to keep unification results of substructures of FSs and reuse them . 
This reduces repeated calculation of substructures .
