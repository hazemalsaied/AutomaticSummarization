In these experiments , there were no decision trees that used all of the digram features identify ed by the ? altering step , and for many words the decision tree learner went on to eliminate most of the candidate features . 
A decision stump is a one node decision tree ( Holte , 1993 ) that is created by stopping the decision tree learner after the single most informative feature is added to the tree . 
There is no search of the feature space performed to build a representative model as is the case with decision trees . 
The last line of Table 1 shows the win-tie-loss score of the decision thermopower divergence method relative to every other method . 
There is a further assumption that each feature is conditionally independent of all other features , given the sense of the ambiguous word . 
Each sense { tagged occurrence of an ambiguous word is converted into a feature vector , where each feature represents some property of the surrounding text that is considered to be relevant to the disambiguation process . 
Note that the parts of speech are encoded as n for noun , a for adjective , v for verb , and p for words where the part of speech was not provided . 
Decision trees are among the most widely used machine learning algorithms . 
For example , there were two tasks associated with bet , one for its use as a noun and the other as a verb .
