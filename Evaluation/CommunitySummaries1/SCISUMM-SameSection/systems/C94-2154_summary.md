THE CORRECT AND EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION OF APPROPRIATENESS SPECIFICATIONS FOR TYPED FEATURE STRUCTURES
there are a number of different constraint languages within feature structure frameworks ( e.g. , Alshawi et al . 1991 ; Carpenter 1992 ; Dorre and Eisle 1991 ; Emele and Zajac 1990 ; Gerdemann and King 1994 ; Krieger and Schafer 1994 ; de Paiva 1993 ; Smolka 1989 ) . 
Legerdemain and G6tz 's Troll system ( see [ G6Tz 1993 ] , [ GFRDEIVIANN AND KING 1994 ] and [ GERDEMANN ( FC ) ] ) employs an efficient refinement of RES to test the satisfiability of feature structures . 
Thus , though RES is computationally expensive , Troll uses RES only during compilation , never during run time . 
Unification lbrmMisms may be either un-typed ( DCC~s , PATRII , 1 , F ( ; ) or typed ( npsG ) . 
A m~L , ior reason for adding types to ~ form ism is to express restrictions on feature a.s in ( ; l 's ( : : [ 5 ] in order to rule out nonexistent ) es of objects . 
For example , there are no verbs which have the [ mixture . The simplest way to express such restrictions is by means of a.n appropriateness function : Type ร Feat ~ Type . 
With such a.n ample rol ) brittleness son Sllch restriction s may be expressed , though no restrictions involving entrances be expressed .
