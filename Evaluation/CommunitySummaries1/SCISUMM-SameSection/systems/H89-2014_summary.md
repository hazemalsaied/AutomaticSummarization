This approach is similar in spirit to the iterative computational approaches of the Hidden Markov Models ( Kupiec , 1989

This has the disadvantage that they can not share training data . 
The paper describes refinements that are currently being investigated in a model for part-of-speech assignment to words in unrestricted text.

To model such dependency across the phrase , the networks shown in Figure 2 can be used . 
In this regard , word equivalence classes were used ( Kupiec , 1989 ) . 
In a ranked list of words in the corpus the most frequent 100 words account for approximately 50 % of the total tokens in the corpus , and thus data is available to estimate them reliably . 
State chains are used to model selective higher-order conditioning in the model , which obviates the proliferation of parameters attendant in uniformly higher-order models . 
The former represents 95.6 % correct word tagging on the text as a whole ( ignoring unknown words ) , and 89 % on the ambiguous words . 
In the 21 category model reported in Kupiec ( 1989 ) only 129 equivalence classes were required to cover a 30,000 word dictionary . 
Methods have ranged from locally-operating rules ( Greene and Rubin , 1971 ) , to statistical methods ( Church , 1989 ; DeRose , 1988 ; Garside , Leech and Sampson , 1987 ; Jelinek , 1985 ) and back-propagation ( Benello , Mackie and Anderson , 1989 ; Nakamura and Shikano , 1989 ) .
