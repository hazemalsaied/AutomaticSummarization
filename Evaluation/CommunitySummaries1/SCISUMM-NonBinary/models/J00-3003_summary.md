While there is hardly consensus on exactly how discourse structure should be described , some agreement exists that a useful first level of analysis involves the identification of dialog acts ( DAs ) . 
Thus , DAs can be thought of as a tag set that classifies utterances according to a combination of pragmatic , semantic , and syntactic criteria . 
Interaction dominance ( Linell 1990 ) might be measured more accurately using DA distributions than with simpler techniques , and could serve as an indicator of the type or genre of discourse at hand . 
In all these cases , DA labels would enrich the available input for higher-level processing of the spoken words .

< .1 % Hey thanks a lot < .1 % The goal of this article is twofold : On the one hand , we aim to present a comprehensive framework for modeling and automatic classification of DAs , founded on well-known statistical methods . 
For example , our model draws on the use of DA n-grams and the hidden Markov models of conversation present in earlier work , such as Nagata and Morimoto ( 1993 , 1994 ) and Woszczyna and Waibel ( 1994 ) ( see Section 7 ) . 
However , our framework generalizes earlier models , giving us a clean probabilistic approach for performing DA classification from unreliable words and non lexical evidence . 
For the speech recognition task , our framework provides a mathematically principled way to condition the speech recognizer on conversation context through dialog structure , as well as on non lexical information correlated with DA identity . 
Second , we present results obtained with this approach on a large , widely available corpus of spontaneous conversational speech . 
The domain we chose to model is the Switchboard corpus of human-human conversational telephone speech ( Godfrey , Holliman , and McDaniel 1992 ) distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium . 
The computation of likelihoods P ( EIU ) depends on the types of evidence used . 
Prosodic features-Evidence is given by the acoustic features F capturing various aspects of pitch , duration , energy , etc. , of the speech signal ; the associated likelihoods are P ( F I U ) . 
The importance of the Markov assumption for the discourse grammar is that we can now view the whole system of discourse grammar and local utterance-based likelihoods as a kth-order hidden Markov model ( HMM ) ( Rabiner and Juang 1986 ) . 
The HMM states correspond to DAs , observations correspond to utterances , transition probabilities are given by the discourse grammar ( see Section 4 ) , and observation probabilities are given by the local likelihoods P ( Eil Ui ) . 
We conducted preliminary experiments to assess how neural networks compare to decision trees for the type of data studied here .

A back channel is a short utterance that plays discourse-structuring roles , erg , indicating that the speaker should go on talking . 
These are usually referred to in the conversation analysis literature as `` continuer '' and have been studied extensively ( Jefferson 1984 ; Schegloff 1982 ; Yngve 1970 ) .
