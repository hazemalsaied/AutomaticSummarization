This latter evaluation compares the performance of the system with that of several human judges since, as we shall show, even people do not agree on a single correct way to segment a text. A related point is that mutual information is helpful in augmenting existing electronic dictionaries, (cf. Twentieth-century linguistic work on Chinese (Chao 1968; Li and Thompson 1981; Tang 1988,1989, inter alia) has revealed the incorrectness of this traditional view. In Chinese text, individual characters of the script, to which we shall refer by their traditional name of hanzi,Z are written one after another with no intervening spaces; a Chinese sentence is shown in Figure 1.3 Partly as a result of this, the notion "word" has never played a role in Chinese philological tradition, and the idea that Chinese lacks anyÃÂ­ thing analogous to words in European languages has been prevalent among Western sinologists; see DeFrancis (1984). We have provided methods for handling certain classes of unknown words, and models for other classes could be provided, as we have noted. The first point we need to address is what type of linguistic object a hanzi repreÃÂ­ sents. However, as we have noted, nothing inherent in the approach precludes incorporating higher-order constraints, provided they can be effectively modeled within a finite-state framework. then define the best segmentation to</a></body>
