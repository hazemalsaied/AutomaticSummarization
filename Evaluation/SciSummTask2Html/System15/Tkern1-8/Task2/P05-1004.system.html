We also demonstrate the use of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for calculating vector-space semantic similarity. Instead, we use vector-space similarity to retrieve a number of synonyms for each unknown common noun. Once this task is solved successfully, it may be possible to insert words directly into the fine-grained distinctions of the hierarchy itself. We describe an unsupervised approach, based on vector-space similarity, which does not require annotated examples but significantly outperforms their tagger. Such a corpus is needed to acquire reliable contextual information for the often very rare nouns we are attempting to supersense tag. We have experimented with several parameters finding that the best configuration uses 50 extracted synonyms, filtered by frequency and number of contexts to increase their reliability.
