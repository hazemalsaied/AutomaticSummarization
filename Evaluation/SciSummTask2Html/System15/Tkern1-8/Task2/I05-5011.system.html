Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically. We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications. However, there are phrases which express the same meanings even though they do not share the same keyword. For example, in the phrase ÃḃÂÂCompany-A last week purchased rival Marshalls from Company-BÃḃÂÂ, the purchased company is Marshalls, not Company-B. We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages. In order to create good-sized vectors for similarity calculation, they had to set a high frequency threshold, 30. Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01]. One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01]. However, those methods need initial seeds, so the relation between entities has to be known in advance. The basic strategy is, for a given pair of entity types, to start with some examples, like several famous</a></body>
