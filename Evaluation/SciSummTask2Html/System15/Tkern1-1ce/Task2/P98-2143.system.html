Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge. Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7% for the genre of techÃÂ­ nical manuals and at least in this genre, the approach appears to be more successful than other similar methods. One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledgeÃÂ­ based system, however, is that it is a very labourÃÂ­ intensive and time-consuming task. Our evaluation, however, suggests that much less is lost than might be feared. There might be cases where one or more of the antecedent indicators do not "point" to the correct antecedent. Our evaluaÃÂ­ tion, based on 63 examples (anaphors) from a techÃÂ­ nical manual (Sony 1992), indicates a success rate of 95.2% (and critical success rate 89.3 %). While various alternatives have been proposed, making use of e.g. neural networks, a situation seÃÂ­ mantics framework, or the principles of reasoning with uncertainty (e.g. Connoly et al. 1994; Mitkov 1995; Tin & Akman 1995), there is still a strong need for the development of robust and effective strategies to meet the demands of practical NLP systems, and to enhance further the automatic proÃÂ­ cessing of growing language resources. Top symptoms like "lexical reiteration" asÃÂ­ sign score "2" whereas "non-prepositional" noun phrases are given a negative score of "-1". The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolvÃÂ­</a></body>
