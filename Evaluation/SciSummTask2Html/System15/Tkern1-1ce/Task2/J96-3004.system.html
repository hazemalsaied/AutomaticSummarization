<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Twentieth-century linguistic work on Chinese (Chao 1968; Li and Thompson 1981; Tang 1988,1989, inter alia) has revealed the incorrectness of this traditional view. A related point is that mutual information is helpful in augmenting existing electronic dictionaries, (cf. Any NLP application that presumes as input unrestricted text requires an initial phase of text analysis; such applications involve problems as diverse as machine translation, information retrieval, and text-to-speech synthesis (TIS). In Chinese text, individual characters of the script, to which we shall refer by their traditional name of hanzi,Z are written one after another with no intervening spaces; a Chinese sentence is shown in Figure 1.3 Partly as a result of this, the notion "word" has never played a role in Chinese philological tradition, and the idea that Chinese lacks anyÃÂ­ thing analogous to words in European languages has been prevalent among Western sinologists; see DeFrancis (1984). This latter evaluation compares the performance of the system with that of several human judges since, as we shall show, even people do not agree on a single correct way to segment a text. For example, as Gan (1994) has noted, one can construct examples where the segmenÃÂ­ tation is locally ambiguous but can be determined on the basis of sentential or even discourse context. (See Sproat and Shih 1995.) then define the best segmentation to be the cheapest or best path in Id(I) o D* (i.e., Id(I) composed with the transitive closure of 0).6 Consider the abstract example illustrated in Figure 2.
