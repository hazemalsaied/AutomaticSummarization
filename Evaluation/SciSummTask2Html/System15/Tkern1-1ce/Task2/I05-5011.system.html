We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications. However, there are phrases which express the same meanings even though they do not share the same keyword. Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically. More examples are shown in Figure 5. For example, in the CC-domain, 96 keywords are found which have TF/ITF scores above a threshold; some of them are shown in Figure 3. Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01]. For example, in the phrase ÃḃÂÂCompany-A last week purchased rival Marshalls from Company-BÃḃÂÂ, the purchased company is Marshalls, not Company-B. We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages. We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications. This approach needs a phrase as an initial seed and thus the possible relationships to be extracted are naturally limited. Finally, we find links between sets of phrases, based on the NE instance pair data (for example, different phrases which link ÃḃÂÂIBMÃḃÂÂ and ÃḃÂÂLotusÃḃÂÂ)</a></body>
