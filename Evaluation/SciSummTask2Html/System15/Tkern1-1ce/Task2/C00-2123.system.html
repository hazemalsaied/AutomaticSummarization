The approach assumes that the word reordering is restricted to a few positions in the source sentence. The translation direction is from German to English.

For the error counts, a range from 0:0 to 1:0 is used. A modified language model probability pÃÂ(eje0; e00) is defined as follows: pÃÂ(eje0; e00) = 1:0 if ÃÂ = 0 p(eje0; e00) if ÃÂ = 1 : We associate a distribution p(ÃÂ) with the two cases ÃÂ = 0 and ÃÂ = 1 and set p(ÃÂ = 1) = 0:7. The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language. The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task (GermanEnglish, 8000-word vocabulary), which is a</a></body>
