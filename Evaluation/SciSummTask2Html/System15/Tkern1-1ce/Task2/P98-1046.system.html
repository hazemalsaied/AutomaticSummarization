<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr, 1997). Whereas each WordNet synset is hierarchicalized accordÃÂ­ ing to only one aspect (e.g., Result, in the case of cut), Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features, without designating one as primary. 2. Second, since the translation mapÃÂ­ pings may often be many-to-many, the alterna re bat er (bo unc e) flut uar (flo at) rola r (rol l) desl izar (sli de) deri var (dr ift) pla nar (gli de) dati ve ÃḃÂáẁ c o n a t i v e c a u s . / i n c h . m i d d l e acc ept. As in English, these verbs seem to take different alterÃÂ­ nations, and the ability of each to participate in an alternation is related to its semantic content. The fundamental assumption is that the syntactic frames are a direct reflection of the unÃÂ­ derlying semantics. Two current approaches to English verb classiÃÂ­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993). We have preliminary indications that the membership of our intersective sets will be more compatible with</a></body>
