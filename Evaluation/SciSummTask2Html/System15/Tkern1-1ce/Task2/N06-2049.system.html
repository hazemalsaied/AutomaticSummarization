<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach. This approach is effective for performing desired segmentation based on usersÃḃÂÂ requirements to R-oov and R-iv. We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation. Using the CRFs approaches, we prove that it outperformed the character- based method using the CRF approaches. Table 1 shows the performance of the dictionary-based segmentation. For example, inconsistent errors of foreign names can be fixed if alphabetical characters are known. For example, ÃḃÂÂ (Beijing-city)ÃḃÂÂ can be segmented as ÃḃÂÂ (Beijing-city)/O,ÃḃÂÂ or ÃḃÂÂ (Beijing)/B (city)/I,ÃḃÂÂ or ÃḃÂÂ (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/I.ÃḃÂÂ In this work we used forward maximal match (FMM) for disambiguation. In this work we propose a confidence measure approach to lessen the weakness. The authors appreciate the reviewersÃḃÂÂ effort and good advice for improving the paper. Since it was a closed test, some information such as Arabic and Chinese number and alphabetical letters cannot be used. Its calculation is defined as: C M(tiob |w) = ÃáẁC Miob (tiob |w) + (1 ÃḃÂÂ Ãáẁ)Ãáṗ(tw , tiob )ng (2) where tiob is the word wÃḃÂÂs IOB tag assigned by the IOB tagging; tw , a prior IOB tag determined by the results of the dictionary-based segmentation. The upper numbers are of the character- based and the lower ones, the subword-based. However, there are multiple choices for a subword-based IOB tagger. By these</a></body>
