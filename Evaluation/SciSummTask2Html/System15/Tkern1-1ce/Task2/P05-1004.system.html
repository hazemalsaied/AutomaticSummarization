We describe an unsupervised approach, based on vector-space similarity, which does not require annotated examples but significantly outperforms their tagger. Finally, SEXTANT collapses the nn, nnprep and adj relations together into a single broad noun-modifier grammatical relation. Such a corpus is needed to acquire reliable contextual information for the often very rare nouns we are attempting to supersense tag. Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001). A considerable amount of research addresses structurally and statistically manipulating the hierarchy of WORD- NET and the construction of new wordnets using the concept structure from English. We also demonstrate the use of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for calculating vector-space semantic similarity. The supersenses of these synonyms are then combined to determine the supersense. Once this task is solved successfully, it may be possible to insert words directly into the fine-grained distinctions of the hierarchy itself. We have experimented with several parameters finding that the best configuration uses 50 extracted synonyms, filtered by frequency and number of contexts to increase their reliability. Our approach to vector-space similarity is based on the SEXTANT system described in Grefenstette (1994).
