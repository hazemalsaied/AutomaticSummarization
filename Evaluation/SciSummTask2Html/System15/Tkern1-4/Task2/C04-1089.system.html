We discarded all the Chinese words in the context that were not in the dictionary we used. So we use the the context of c , we are likely to retrieve the context of e when we use the context of c as query C(c) to retrieve a document C (e* ) that * the query and try to retrieve the most similar best matches the query.

The English Gigaword corpus consists of news from four newswire services: Agence France Press English Service, Associated Press Worldstream English Service, New York Times Newswire Service, and Xinhua News Agency English Service. New words such as person names, organization names, technical terms, etc. appear frequently. We thank Jia Li for implementing the EM algorithm to train transliteration probabilities. Finally, the English candidate word with the smallest average rank position and that appears within the top M positions of both ranked lists is the chosen English translation (as described in Section 2).
