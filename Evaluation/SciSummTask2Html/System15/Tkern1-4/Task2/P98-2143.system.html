<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The "Baseline subject" model tested on the same data scored 33.9% recall and 67.9% precision, whereas "Baseline most recent" scored 66.7%. Our evaluaÃÂ­ tion, based on 63 examples (anaphors) from a techÃÂ­ nical manual (Sony 1992), indicates a success rate of 95.2% (and critical success rate 89.3 %). Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7% for the genre of techÃÂ­ nical manuals and at least in this genre, the approach appears to be more successful than other similar methods. The sample texts conÃÂ­ tained 180 pronouns among which were 120 inÃÂ­ stances of exophoric reference (most being zero proÃÂ­ nouns). Our evaluation, however, suggests that much less is lost than might be feared. Top symptoms like "lexical reiteration" asÃÂ­ sign score "2" whereas "non-prepositional" noun phrases are given a negative score of "-1". As expected, some of the preferences had to be modified in order to fit with specific features of Polish (Mitkov & Stys 1997). One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledgeÃÂ­ based system, however, is that it is a very labourÃÂ­ intensive and time-consuming task. Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge. To turn on the printer, press the Power buttoni and hold iti down for a moment. We have described a robust, knowledge-poor apÃÂ­ proach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger. The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolvÃÂ­ ing anaphors (with critical success rate of 86.2%).</a></body>
