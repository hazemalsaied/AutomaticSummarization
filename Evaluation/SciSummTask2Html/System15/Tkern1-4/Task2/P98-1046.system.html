<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr, 1997). The sets of syntactic frames associated with a particular Levin class are not intended to be arbitrary, and they are supposed to reflect unÃÂ­ derlying semantic components that constrain alÃÂ­ lowable arguments. Second, since the translation mapÃÂ­ pings may often be many-to-many, the alterna re bat er (bo unc e) flut uar (flo at) rola r (rol l) desl izar (sli de) deri var (dr ift) pla nar (gli de) dati ve ÃḃÂáẁ c o n a t i v e c a u s . / i n c h . m i d d l e acc ept. Whereas each WordNet synset is hierarchicalized accordÃÂ­ ing to only one aspect (e.g., Result, in the case of cut), Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features, without designating one as primary. The fundamental assumption is that the syntactic frames are a direct reflection of the unÃÂ­ derlying semantics. These subclasses correspond very well to the English subclasses created by the intersective class. 2. One of the most controversial areas has to do with polysemy. As in English, these verbs</a></body>
