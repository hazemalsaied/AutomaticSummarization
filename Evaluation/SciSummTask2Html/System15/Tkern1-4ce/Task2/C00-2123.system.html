The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task (GermanEnglish, 8000-word vocabulary), which is a limited-domain spoken-language task. For the error counts, a range from 0:0 to 1:0 is used. SSER: subjective sentence error rate: For a more detailed analysis, the translations are judged by a human test person. We are given a source string fJ 1 = f1:::fj :::fJ of length J, which is to be translated into a target string eI 1 = e1:::ei:::eI of length I. Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability: ^eI 1 = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1jfJ 1 )g = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1) Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1)g : (1) The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language. The approach assumes that the word reordering is restricted to a few positions in the source sentence. The translation direction is from German to English. = p(fj je) max ÃÂ;e00 j02Cnfjg np(jjj0; J) p(ÃÂ) pÃÂ(eje0; e00) Qe00 (e0;C n fjg; j 0 )o: The DP equation is evaluated recursively for each hypothesis (e0; e; C; j).
