We discarded all the Chinese words in the context that were not in the dictionary we used. As pointed out earlier, most previous research only considers either transliteration or context information in determining the translation of a source language word w, but not both sources of information. The English Gigaword corpus consists of news from four newswire services: Agence France Press English Service, Associated Press Worldstream English Service, New York Times Newswire Service, and Xinhua News Agency English Service. It also made use of part-of-speech tag information, whereas our method is simpler and does not require part-of- speech tagging. New words such as person names, organization names, technical terms, etc. appear frequently. We thank Jia Li for implementing the EM algorithm to train transliteration probabilities. They combined the two sources of information by weighting the two individual scores, whereas we made use of the average rank for combination. So we use the the context of c , we are likely to retrieve the context of e when we use the context of c as query C(c) to retrieve a document C (e* ) that * the query and try to retrieve</a></body>
