Once this task is solved successfully, it may be possible to insert words directly into the fine-grained distinctions of the hierarchy itself. Curran and Moens (2002b) compared several context extraction methods and found that the shallow pipeline and grammatical relation extraction used in SEXTANT was both extremely fast and produced high-quality results. We also demonstrate the use of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for calculating vector-space semantic similarity. We describe the shallow pipeline in detail below. Such a corpus is needed to acquire reliable contextual information for the often very rare nouns we are attempting to supersense tag. We describe an unsupervised approach, based on vector-space similarity, which does not require annotated examples but significantly outperforms their tagger. Our approach to vector-space similarity is based on the SEXTANT system described in Grefenstette (1994). The types of grammatical relation extracted by SEXTANT are shown in Table 4. Our approach uses voting across the known supersenses of automatically extracted synonyms, to select a super- sense for the unknown nouns. One solution would be to take the intersection between vectors across words for each supersense (i.e. to find the common contexts that these words appear in). We would like to thank Massi Ciaramita for supplying his original data for these experiments and answering our queries, and to Stephen Clark and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback and corrections. Using this approach we have significantly outperformed the</a></body>
