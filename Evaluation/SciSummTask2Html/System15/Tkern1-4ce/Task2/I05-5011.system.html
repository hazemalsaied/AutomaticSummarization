However, there are phrases which express the same meanings even though they do not share the same keyword. We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications. For example, in the phrase ÃḃÂÂCompany-A last week purchased rival Marshalls from Company-BÃḃÂÂ, the purchased company is Marshalls, not Company-B. Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically. However, those methods need initial seeds, so the relation between entities has to be known in advance. One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01]. Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01]. In the CC-domain, there are 32 sets of phrases which contain more than 2 phrases. There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora. More examples are shown in Figure 5. We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages. For example,</a></body>
