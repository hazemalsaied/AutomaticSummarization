We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach. For example, inconsistent errors of foreign names can be fixed if alphabetical characters are known. Using the CRFs approaches, we prove that it outperformed the character- based method using the CRF approaches. For example, ÃḃÂÂ (Beijing-city)ÃḃÂÂ can be segmented as ÃḃÂÂ (Beijing-city)/O,ÃḃÂÂ or ÃḃÂÂ (Beijing)/B (city)/I,ÃḃÂÂ or ÃḃÂÂ (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/I.ÃḃÂÂ In this work we used forward maximal match (FMM) for disambiguation. We proved the new approach enhanced the word segmentation significantly. This approach is effective for performing desired segmentation based on usersÃḃÂÂ requirements to R-oov and R-iv.

The upper numbers are of the character- based and the lower ones, the subword-based.
