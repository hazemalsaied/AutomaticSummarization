Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement. Therefore, it would be interesting to see how imperfect EDT affects the performance in relation extraction. (1999). 5 4 5. Here, the base phrase chunks are derived from full parse trees using the Perl script5 written by Sabine Buchholz from Tilburg University and the CollinsÃḃÂÂ parser (Collins 1999) is employed for full parsing. We also extend the list by collecting the trigger words from the head words of the mentions in the training data according to their indicating relationships. Although tree kernel-based approaches facilitate the exploration of the implicit feature space with the parse tree structure, yet the current technologies are expected to be further advanced to be effective for relatively complicated relation extraction tasks such as the one defined in ACE where 5 types and 24 subtypes need to be extracted. Country Name List This is to differentiate the relation subtype ÃḃÂÂROLE.Citizen-OfÃḃÂÂ, which defines the relationship between a person and the country of the personÃḃÂÂs citizenship, from other subtypes, especially ÃḃÂÂROLE.ResidenceÃḃÂÂ, where</a></body>
