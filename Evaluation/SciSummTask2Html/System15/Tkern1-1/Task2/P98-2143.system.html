Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge. Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7% for the genre of techÃÂ­ nical manuals and at least in this genre, the approach appears to be more successful than other similar methods. One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledgeÃÂ­ based system, however, is that it is a very labourÃÂ­ intensive and time-consuming task. Top symptoms like "lexical reiteration" asÃÂ­ sign score "2" whereas "non-prepositional" noun phrases are given a negative score of "-1". The collocation preference here is restricted to the patterns "noun phrase (pronoun), verb" and "verb, noun phrase (pronoun)". As expected, some of the preferences had to be modified in order to fit with specific features of Polish (Mitkov & Stys 1997). Our evaluaÃÂ­ tion, based on 63 examples (anaphors) from a techÃÂ­ nical manual (Sony 1992), indicates a success rate of 95.2% (and critical success rate 89.3 %). Our evaluation, however, suggests that much less is lost than might be feared. To turn on the printer, press the Power buttoni and hold iti down for a moment. There might be cases where one or more of the antecedent indicators do not "point" to the correct antecedent. The latter proposes the ranking "subject, direct obÃÂ­ ject, indirect object" (Brennan et al. 1987) and noun phrases which are parts of prepositional phrases are usually indirect</a></body>
