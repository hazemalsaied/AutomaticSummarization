<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr, 1997). Current approaches to English classificaÃÂ­ tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limitaÃÂ­ tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes. Whereas each WordNet synset is hierarchicalized accordÃÂ­ ing to only one aspect (e.g., Result, in the case of cut), Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features, without designating one as primary. As in English, these verbs seem to take different alterÃÂ­ nations, and the ability of each to participate in an alternation is related to its semantic content. The fundamental assumption is that the syntactic frames are a direct reflection of the unÃÂ­ derlying semantics.
