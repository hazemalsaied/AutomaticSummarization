<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications. Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task. However, there are phrases which express the same meanings even though they do not share the same keyword. For example, in the phrase ÃḃÂÂCompany-A last week purchased rival Marshalls from Company-BÃḃÂÂ, the purchased company is Marshalls, not Company-B. Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01]. One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01]. Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically. However, those methods need initial seeds, so the relation between entities has to be known in advance. We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages. Because of this threshold, very few NE instance pairs could be used and hence the variety of phrases was also limited. More examples are shown in Figure 5. Applications The discovered paraphrases have multiple applications. This approach</a></body>
