We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach. This approach is effective for performing desired segmentation based on usersÃḃÂÂ requirements to R-oov and R-iv. For example, inconsistent errors of foreign names can be fixed if alphabetical characters are known. Using the CRFs approaches, we prove that it outperformed the character- based method using the CRF approaches. Its calculation is defined as: C M(tiob |w) = ÃáẁC Miob (tiob |w) + (1 ÃḃÂÂ Ãáẁ)Ãáṗ(tw , tiob )ng (2) where tiob is the word wÃḃÂÂs IOB tag assigned by the IOB tagging; tw , a prior IOB tag determined by the results of the dictionary-based segmentation. We proved the new approach enhanced the word segmentation significantly. Table 1 shows the performance of the dictionary-based segmentation. By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005. The authors appreciate the reviewersÃḃÂÂ effort and good advice for improving the paper. The data contain four corpora from different sources: Academia Sinica (AS), City University of Hong Kong (CITYU), Peking University (PKU) and Microsoft Research in Beijing (MSR). If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used. However, there are multiple choices for a</a></body>
