<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We also proposed a method to find paraphrases in the context of two Named Entity instances in a large un-annotated corpus (Sekine 05).</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This sparked intensive research on unsupervised acquisition of entailment rules (and similarly paraphrases) e.g.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Consequently, sub stantial effort has been made to learn such rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008; Schoenmackers et al., 2010).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(Sekine, 2005), (CallisonBurch, 2008)), but most do not.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A number of automatically acquired inference rule/paraphrase collections are available, such as (Szpektor et al., 2004), (Sekine, 2005).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The coverage of u by v is measured bypare between these complex features of t and tl (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005).</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If the same pair of NE instances is used with different phrases, these phrases are likely to be paraphrases.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Keywords with more than one word In the evaluation, we explained that “chairman” and “vice chairman” are considered paraphrases.</a>
