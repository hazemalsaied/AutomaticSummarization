<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>More re cently, the task of automatic supersense tagging has emerged for English (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Curran, 2005; Ciaramita and Altun, 2006; PaaÃŸ and Reichartz, 2009), as well as for Italian (Picca et al., 2008; Picca et al., 2009; Attardi et al., 2010) and Chinese (Qiu et al., 2011), languages with WordNetsmapped to English WordNet.3 In principle, we be lieve supersenses ought to apply to nouns and verbsin any language, and need not depend on the avail ability of a semantic lexicon.4 In this work we focuson the noun SSTs, summarized in figure 2 and ap plied to an Arabic sentence in figure 1.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Instead, we use vector-space similarity to retrieve a number of synonyms for each unknown common noun.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, sometimes the unknown noun does not appear in our 2 billion word corpus, or at least does not appear frequently enough to provide sufficient contextual information to extract reliable synonyms.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>He first extracts synonyms for the unknown word using vector-space similarity measures based on Latent Semantic Analysis and then searches for a location in the hierarchy nearest to these synonyms.</a>
