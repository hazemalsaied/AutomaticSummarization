<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As an alternative to the resource-intensive manual classifications, automatic methods such as classification and clustering are applied to induce verb classes from corpus data, e.g.</a>

<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Low- frequency and ambiguous verbs were excluded from the classes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In these experiments, they enlarged the number of gold standard English verb classes to 14 classes related to Levin classes, with a total of 841 verbs.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In addition, a significant amount of information is lost in pairwise clustering.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For the evaluation of the clustering results, we calculated the accuracy of the clusters, a cluster similarity measure that has been applied before, cf.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>They found that a semisupervised approach where the classifier was trained with five seed verbs from each verb class outperformed both a manual selection of features and the unsupervised 186 approach of Dash, Liu, and Yao (1997), which used an entropy measure to organize data into a multidimensional space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our feature space was designed to reflect these classes by capturing properties of the semantic arguments of verbs and their mapping to syntactic positions.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The 13-way task includes all of our classes.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In an unsupervised (clustering) scenario of verb class discovery, can we maintain the benefit of only needing noisy features, without the generality of the feature space leading to “the curse of dimensionality”?</a>
