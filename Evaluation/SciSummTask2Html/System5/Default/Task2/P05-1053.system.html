<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A technique that many previous approaches have used is shallow parsing (Koike et al., 2003; Yao et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2005).</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(2005) introduce additional chunking features to enhance the parse tree features.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This is a lightweight model and generally does not attempt to exhaustively leverage all possible proven sources of useful features (Zhou et al., 2005) towards a higher absolute score, but rather to serve as a point of comparison to the models which rely on syntactic information.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Zhou et al (2005) further systematically explored diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features through support vector machines and achieved F- measure of 68.1 and 55.5 on the 5 relation types and the 24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus respectively.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This paper investigates the incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using SVM.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It shows that our system achieves the performance of 84.8%/66.7%/74.7 in precision/recall/F- measure on relation detection.</a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This paper uses the ACE corpus provided by LDC to train and evaluate our feature-based relation extraction system.		</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The experiment result also shows that our feature-based approach outperforms the tree kernel-based approaches by more than 20 F-measure on the extraction of 5 ACE relation types.</a>
