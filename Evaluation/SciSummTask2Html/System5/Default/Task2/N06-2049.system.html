<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Among these strategies, the confidence measure used to combine the results of CT and DS is a straightforward one, which is introduced in (Zhang et al., 2006a).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus, the bigram â€œRAIL ENQUIRIESâ€\x9d gives a misleading probability that â€œRAILâ€\x9d is followed by â€œENQUIRIESâ€\x9d irrespective of what precedes it.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If the confidence of a character is lower than the threshold, the tag of that character will be adjusted to the tag assigned by the Maximum Probability Segmentation (R. Zhang et al., 2006).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>2 Table 5Segmentation performance presented in previous work and of our combination model.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>After we get word-based segmentation result, we use it to revise the CRF tagging result similar to (Zhang et al., 2006).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We chose the three models that achieved at least one best score in the closed tests from Emerson (2005), as well as the sub-word-based model of Zhang, Kikui, and Sumita (2006) for comparison.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We also successfully employed the confidence measure to make a confidence-dependent word segmentation.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The character-based “IOB” tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The effect of the confidence measure is shown in Table 3, where we used α = 0.7 and confidence threshold t = 0.8.</a>
