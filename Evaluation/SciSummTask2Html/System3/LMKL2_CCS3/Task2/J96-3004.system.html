<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>While size of the resulting transducers may seem daunting-the segmenter described here, as it is used in the Bell Labs Mandarin TTS system has about 32,000 states and 209,000 arcs-recent work on minimization of weighted machines and transducers (cf. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Furthermore, by inverting the transducer so that it maps from phonemic transcriptions to hanzi sequences, one can apply the segmenter to other problems, such as speech recognition. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Since the transducers are built from human-readable descriptions using a lexical toolkit, the system is easily maintained and extended. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We used a maximum- matching algorithm and a dictionary compiled from the CTB  to do segmentation </a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Many natural language models can be captured by weighted finite-state transducers, which offer several benefits:â€¢ WFSTs provide a uniform knowledge represen tation. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Despite these limitations, a purely finite-state approach to Chinese word segmentation enjoys a number of strong advantages. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As described in Sproat, the Chinese segmenter presented here fits directly into the context of a broader finite-state model of text analysis for speech synthesis. </a>
