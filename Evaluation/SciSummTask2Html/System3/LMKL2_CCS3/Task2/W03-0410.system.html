<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We instead proposed a semi-supervised method in which a seed set of verbs is chosen for training a supervised classifier, from which the useful features are extracted for use in clustering. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Furthermore, the method is relatively insensitive to the precise makeup of the selected seed set. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We cluster verbs into lexical semantic classes, using a general set of noisy features that capture syntactic and semantic properties of the verbs. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We find that manual selection of a subset of features based on the known classification performs better than using a full set of noisy features, demonstrating the potential benefit of feature selection in our task. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We have explored manual, unsupervised, and semi- supervised methods for feature selection in a clustering approach for verb class discovery. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In moving to a scenario of verb class discovery, using clustering, we face the problem of having a large number of irrelevant features for a particular clustering task. </a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Our feature set is essentially a generalization of theirs, but in scaling up the feature space to be useful across English verb classes in general, we necessarily face a dimensionality problem that did not arise in their research. </a>
