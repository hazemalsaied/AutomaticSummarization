<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation. </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our main contribution is to extend the IOB tagging approach from being a character-based to a subword-based. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Using the CRFs approaches, we prove that it outperformed the character- based method using the CRF approaches. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>After we get word-based segmentation result, we use it to revise the CRF tagging result similar to. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We found a speed up both in training and test. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For AS corpus, “Adam Smith” are two words in the training but become a one- word in the test, “AdamSmith”. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We chose the three models that achieved at least one best score in the closed tests from Emerson  for comparison. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We achieved the highest F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our results are listed together with the best results from Bakeoff 2005 in Table 4 in terms of F-scores. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We also successfully employed the confidence measure to make a confidence-dependent word segmentation. </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This approach is effective for performing desired segmentation based on users’ requirements to R-oov and R-iv. </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>For this purpose, our system is based on a combination of subword-based tagging method. </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>CRF + Rule system represents a combination of CRF model and rule based model presented in Zhang et al.. </a>
