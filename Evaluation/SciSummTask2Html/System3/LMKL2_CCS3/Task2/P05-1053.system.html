<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This paper investigates the incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using SVM. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For the choice of features, we use the full set of features from Zhou et al.. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Table 2 also measures the contributions of different features by gradually increasing the feature set. </a>
