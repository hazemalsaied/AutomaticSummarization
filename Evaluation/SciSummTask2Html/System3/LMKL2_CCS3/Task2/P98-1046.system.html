<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We also have begun to ex­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VN lexicon which is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levinâ€™s classification, called Intersective Levin classes. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We have also examined a mapping between the English verbs that we have discussed and their Portuguese translations, which have sev­ eral of the same properties as the corresponding verbs in English. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This reorganization which was facilitated by the use of inter- sective Levin classes  refined the classes to account for semantic and syntactic differences within a class </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Palmer  argue that syntactic frames and verb classes are useful for developing principled classifications of verbs. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In computational linguistics, the VerbNet project  bear relation to this work. </a></body>
