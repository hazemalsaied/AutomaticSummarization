<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We also have begun to ex­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We also plan to experiment with different classification schemes for verb semantics such as WordNet. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Dang et al., for example, have refined the current classification by creating intersective classes for those verbs which share membership of more than one Levin class. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>VN is built on a refinement of the Levin classes, the intersective Levin classes, aimed at achieving more coherent classes both semantically and syntactically. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VN lexicon which is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levinâ€™s classification, called Intersective Levin classes. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Palmer  argue that syntactic frames and verb classes are useful for developing principled classifications of verbs. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. </a>
