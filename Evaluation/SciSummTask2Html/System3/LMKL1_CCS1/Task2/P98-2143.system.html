<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We have also adapted and evaluated the approach for Polish. </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The evaluation for Polish was based technical manuals available on the Internet. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Mitkov  obtains a success rate of 89.7% for pronominal references, working with English technical manuals. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolv­ ing anaphors. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In addition, preliminary experiments show that the approach can be success­ fully adapted for other languages with minimum modifications. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>There are many recent approaches to this prob lem, e. g. syntax-based approaches. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As expected, some of the preferences had to be modified in order to fit with specific features of Polish. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledge­ based system, however, is that it is a very labour­ intensive and time-consuming task. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We selected for comparative evaluation three approaches extensively cited in the literature: Kennedy and Boguraevâ€™s parser- free version of Lappin and Leassâ€™ RAP. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We have described a robust, knowledge-poor ap­ proach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger. </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This module resolves third-person personal pronouns and is an adaptation of Mitkovâ€™s robust, knowledge-poor multilingual approach. </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Mitkovâ€™s knowledge-poor pronoun resolution method, for example, uses the scores from a set of antecedent indicators to rank the candidates. </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>['Candidates', 'are', 'assigned', 'scores', 'by', 'each', 'indicator', 'and', 'the', 'candidate', 'with', 'the', 'highest', 'score', 'is', 'returned', 'as']</a></body>
