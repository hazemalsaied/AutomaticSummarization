<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The model described here thus demonstrates great potential for use in widespread applications. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We also thank ChaoHuang Chang, reviewers for the 1994 ACL conference, and four anonymous reviewers for Computational Linguistics for useful comments. </a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>There are several commonly used segmentation methods such as forward maximum matching and backward maximum matching. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Furthermore, by inverting the transducer so that it maps from phonemic transcriptions to hanzi sequences, one can apply the segmenter to other problems, such as speech recognition. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Since the transducers are built from human-readable descriptions using a lexical toolkit, the system is easily maintained and extended. </a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Despite these limitations, a purely finite-state approach to Chinese word segmentation enjoys a number of strong advantages. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The Chinese word segmentation is a nontrivial task because no explicit delimiters. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>As described in Sproat, the Chinese segmenter presented here fits directly into the context of a broader finite-state model of text analysis for speech synthesis. </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In this paper we present a stochastic finite-state model wherein the basic workhorse is the weighted finite-state transducer. </a>
