<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kind of cue. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Many methods for automatic acquisition of rules have been suggested in recent years, ranging from distributional similarity to finding shared contexts. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This has led to active research on broad-scale acquisition of entailment rules for predicates, e.g.. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These results are promising and there are several avenues for improving on these results. </a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The first stage identifies a keyword in each phrase and joins phrases with the same keyword into sets. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In total 13,976 phrases are assigned to sets of phrases, and the accuracy on our evaluation data ranges from 65 to 99%, depending on the domain and the size of the sets. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The accuracy of the sets in representing paraphrase ranged from 73% to 99%, depending on the NE categories and set sizes; the accuracy of the links for two evaluated domains was 73% and 86%. </a>
