<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is a significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words. </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>There are, however, approaches to the complementary problem of determining the closest known sense for unknown words, which can be viewed as the logical next step after unknown sense detection. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In contrast, some research have been focused on using predefined sets of sense-groupings for learning class-based classifiers for WSD. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A concept analogous to our notion of meta sense, and indeed, the CAM might be used for class-based WSD as well. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We would like to move onto the more difficult task of insertion into the hierarchy itself and compare against the initial work by Widdows  using latent semantic analysis. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Canonical attributes summarise the key contexts for each headword and are used to improve the efficiency of the similarity comparisons. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We overcome this by using the synonyms of the last word in the multi-word term. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Further, our similarity system does not currently incorporate multi-word terms. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This application of semantic similarity demonstrates that an unsupervised methods can outperform supervised methods for some NLP tasks if enough data is available. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We also demonstrate the use of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for calculating vector-space semantic similarity. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The question now becomes how to construct vectors of supersenses. </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Ciaramita and Johnson  present a tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples. </a>
