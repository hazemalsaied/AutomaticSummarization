<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The initial stage of text analysis for any NLP task usually involves the tokenization of the input into words. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>There are several commonly used segmentation methods such as forward maximum matching and backward maximum matching. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since the transducers are built from human-readable descriptions using a lexical toolkit, the system is easily maintained and extended. </a>
