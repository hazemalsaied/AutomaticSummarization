<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Evaluation reports a success rate of 89.7% which is better than the suc­ cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolv­ ing anaphors. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The evaluation for Polish was based technical manuals available on the Internet. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We have also adapted and evaluated the approach for Polish. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In addition, preliminary experiments show that the approach can be success­ fully adapted for other languages with minimum modifications. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Mitkovâ€™s knowledge-poor pronoun resolution method, for example, uses the scores from a set of antecedent indicators to rank the candidates. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We have described a robust, knowledge-poor ap­ proach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our paper discusses a particular configuration of this new evaluation environment incorporating three approaches sharing a common â€knowledge-poor philosophyâ€: Kennedy and Boguraevâ€™s  knowledge-poor approach. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Our preference-based approach showed clear su­ periority over both baseline models. </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge. </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>As expected, some of the preferences had to be modified in order to fit with specific features of Polish. </a>
