<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As was explained in the results section, “strength” or “add” are not desirable keywords in the CC-domain. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The first stage identifies a keyword in each phrase and joins phrases with the same keyword into sets. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In total 13,976 phrases are assigned to sets of phrases, and the accuracy on our evaluation data ranges from 65 to 99%, depending on the domain and the size of the sets. </a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This problem arises because our keywords consist of only one word. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>These results are promising and there are several avenues for improving on these results. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system. </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This has led to active research on broad-scale acquisition of entailment rules for predicates, e.g.. </a>
