<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Shao and Ng  presented a method to mine new translations from Chinese and English news documents of the same period from different news agencies, combining both transliteration and context information. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>rank translation candidates using PH and CX independently and return results with the highest average rank. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It also made use of part-of-speech tag information, whereas our method is simpler and does not require part-of- speech tagging. </a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Various correlation measures have been used: log-likelihood ratio  represented contexts using language models. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>At present, the methods for OOV term translation have changed from the basic pattern based on bilingual dictionary, transliteration or parallel corpus to the intermediate pattern based on comparable corpus. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For example, the work of  used only the pronunciation or spelling of w in translation. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The work that is most similar to ours is the recent research of. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Some recent research used comparable corpora to re-score name transliterations. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Koehn and Knight  attempted to combine multiple clues, including similar context and spelling. </a>
