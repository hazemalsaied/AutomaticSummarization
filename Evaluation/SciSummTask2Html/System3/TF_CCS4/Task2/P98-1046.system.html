<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We also have begun to ex­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Besides the obvious influence of WordNet, this work is very much related to Palmer&amp;apos;s VerbNet project. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This reorganization which was facilitated by the use of inter- sective Levin classes  refined the classes to account for semantic and syntactic differences within a class </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this experiment, we have tried to choose the Portuguese verb that is most closely related to the description of the English verb in the Levin class. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VN lexicon which is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levinâ€™s classification, called Intersective Levin classes. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We think that many cases of ambiguÂ­ ous classification of the lexical entry for a verb can be addressed with the notion of intersective sets introduced by Dang et al.. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Palmer  argue that syntactic frames and verb classes are useful for developing principled classifications of verbs. </a></body>
