<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolv­ ing anaphors. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We have also adapted and evaluated the approach for Polish. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Mitkov showed that a salience-based approach can be applied across genres and without complex syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Indeed, existing learning-based approaches to anaphor resolution have performed reasonably well using limited and shallow knowledge, Soon et al. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This paper pres­ ents a robust, knowledge-poor approach to resolving pronouns in technical manuals, which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This module resolves third-person personal pronouns and is an adaptation of Mitkovâ€™s robust, knowledge-poor multilingual approach. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Mitkovâ€™s knowledge-poor pronoun resolution method, for example, uses the scores from a set of antecedent indicators to rank the candidates. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Early work on pronoun anaphora resolution usually uses rule-based methods, which try to mine the cues of the relation between the pronouns and its antecedents. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>As expected, some of the preferences had to be modified in order to fit with specific features of Polish. </a>
