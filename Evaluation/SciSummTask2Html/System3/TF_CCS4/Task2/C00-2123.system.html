<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we describe a search procedure for statistical machine translation. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Skipped : The translation of up to two words may be anticipated. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To formalize the approach, we introduce four verbgroup states S: Initial : A contiguous, initial block of source positions is covered. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For each extension a new position is added to the coverage set. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A position is presented by the word at that position. </a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Starting from a DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem, we present a novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language in order to achieve an eÆcient search algorithm. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We used a translation system called â€œsingle- word based approachâ€ described in. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Covering the first uncovered position in the source sentence, we use the language model probability p. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Our new approach, which is called quasi-monotone search, processes the source sentence monotonically, while explicitly taking into account the positions of the German verbgroup. </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Final : The rest of the sentence is processed monotonically taking account of the already covered positions. </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Using these states, we define partial hypothesis extensions, which are of the following type: ! </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The complexity of the algorithm is O, where E is the size of the target language vocabulary. </a>
