<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This larger corpus was kindly provided to us by United Informatics Inc., R.O.C. a set of initial estimates of the word frequencies.9 In this re-estimation procedure only the entries in the base dictionary were used: in other words, derived words not in the base dictionary and personal and foreign names were not used.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The first probability is estimated from a name count in a text database, and the rest of the probabilities are estimated from a large list of personal names.n Note that in Chang et al.'s model the p(rule 9) is estimated as the product of the probability of finding G 1 in the first position of a two-hanzi given name and the probability of finding G2 in the second position of a two-hanzi given name, and we use essentially the same estimate here, with some modifications as described later on.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Note that hanzi that are not grouped into dictionary words (and are not identified as singleÂ­ hanzi words), or into one of the other categories of words discussed in this paper, are left unattached and tagged as unknown words.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This class-based model gives reasonable results: for six radical classes, Table 1 gives the estimated cost for an unseen hanzi in the class occurring as the second hanzi in a double GIVEN name.</a>
