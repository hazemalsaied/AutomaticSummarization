<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The heuristics used is that in constructions of the form "...(You) V 1 NP ... con (you) V 2 it (con (you) V3 it)", where con e {and/or/before/after...}, the noun phrase immediately after V 1 is a very likely candidate for antecedent of the pronoun "it" imme足 diately following V2 and is therefore given preference (scores 2 and 0).</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>When all preferences (antecedent indicators) are taken into account, however, the right antecedent is still very likely to be tracked down - in the above example, the "non-prepositional noun phrases" heuristics (penalty) would be overturned by the "collocational preference" heuristics.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The antecedent indicators have been identi足 fied empirically and are related to salience (definiteness, givenness, indicating verbs, lexical reiteration, section heading preference, "non足 prepositional" noun phrases), to structural matches (collocation, immediate reference), to referential distance or to preference of terms.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as "antecedent indicators").</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The approach works as follows: it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the re足 maining candidates (see next section).</a>
