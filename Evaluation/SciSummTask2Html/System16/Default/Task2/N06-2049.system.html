<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Even with the use of confidence measure, the word- based IOB tagging still outperformed the character-based IOB tagging.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We found the results in Table 3 were better than those in Table 2 and Table 1, which prove that using confidence measure approach achieved the best performance over the dictionary-based segmentation and the IOB tagging approach.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of IOB tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Before moving to this step in Figure 1, we produced two segmentation results: the one by the dictionary-based approach and the one by the IOB tagging.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used.</a>
