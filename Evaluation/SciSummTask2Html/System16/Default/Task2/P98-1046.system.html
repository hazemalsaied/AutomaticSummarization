<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Figure 2: Intersective class formed from Levin carry, push/pull and split verbs- verbs in() are not listed by Levin in all the intersecting classes but participate in all the alternations The intersection between the push/pull verbs of exerting force, the carry verbs and the split verbs illustrates how the force semantic compo足 nent of a verb can also be used to extend its meaning so that one can infer a causation of accompanied motion.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Although the Levin classes that make up an intersective class may have conflicting alterna足 tions {e.g., verbs of exerting force can take the conative alternation, while carry verbs cannot), this does not invalidate the semantic regularity of the intersective class.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This is exemplified by the Levin cut verbs and the intersective class formed by the cut verbs and split verbs.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We also investigated the Portuguese translation of some intersective classes of motion verbs.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, apart can also be used with other classes of verbs, including many verbs of motion.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As can be seen in Table 2 the alternations for the Portuguese translations of the verbs in this intersective class indicate that they share simi足 lar properties with the English verbs, including the causative/inchoative.</a>
