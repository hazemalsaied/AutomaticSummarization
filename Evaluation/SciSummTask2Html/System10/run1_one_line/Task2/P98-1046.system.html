<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We see verb classes as the key to making gen­ eralizations about regular extensions of mean­ ing.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Two current approaches to English verb classi­ fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If only one or two verbs were shared between two classes, we assumed this might be due to ho­ mophony, an idiosyncrasy involving individual verbs rather than a systematic relationship in­ volving coherent sets of verbs.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>isolate semantic components Some of the large Levin classes comprise verbs that exhibit a wide range of possible semantic components, and could be divided into smaller subclasses.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The list of members for each Levin verb class is not always complete, so to check if a particular verb belongs to a class it is better to check that the verb exhibits all the alternations that de­ fine the class.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Even though the Levin verb classes are defined by their syntactic behavior, many reflect seman­ tic distinctions made by WordNet, a classifica­ tion hierarchy defined in terms of purely se­ mantic word relations (synonyms, hypernyms, etc.).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Whereas each WordNet synset is hierarchicalized accord­ ing to only one aspect (e.g., Result, in the case of cut), Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features, without designating one as primary.</a></body>
