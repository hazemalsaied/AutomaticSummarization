<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the same pair of NE instances is used with different phrases, these phrases are likely to be paraphrases.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Evaluation within a set The evaluation of paraphrases within a set of phrases which share a keyword is illustrated in Figure 4.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For example, the phrase “'s New York-based trust unit,” is not a paraphrase of the other phrases in the “unit” set.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the number of paraphrases to the total number of phrases in the set.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As can be seen in Figure 3, the phrases in the “agree” set include completely different relationships, which are not paraphrases.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Evaluation of links A link between two sets is considered correct if the majority of phrases in both sets have the same meaning, i.e. if the link indicates paraphrase.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].</a>
