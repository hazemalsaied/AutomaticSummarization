<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The character-based “IOB” tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It is composed of three parts: a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>71 6 0.9 64 0.9 72 Table 2: Segmentation results by a pure subword-based IOB tagging.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of IOB tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We found the results in Table 3 were better than those in Table 2 and Table 1, which prove that using confidence measure approach achieved the best performance over the dictionary-based segmentation and the IOB tagging approach.</a>
