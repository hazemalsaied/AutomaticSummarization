<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Making the reasonable assumption that similar information is relevant for solving these problems in Chinese, it follows that a prerequisite for intonation-boundary assignment and prominence assignment is word segmentation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There are thus some very good reasons why segmentation into words is an important task.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Following Sproat and Shih (1990), performance for Chinese segmentation systems is generally reported in terms of the dual measures of precision and recalP It is fairly standard to report precision and recall scores in the mid to high 90% range.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Indeed, as we shall show in Section 5, even human judges differ when presented with the task of segmenting a text into words, so a definition of the criteria used to determine that a given segmentation is correct is crucial before one can interpret such measures.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Besides the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a correct segmentation for a given Chinese sentence, there is the more general issue that the test corpora used in these evaluations differ from system to system, so meaningful comparison between systems is rendered even more difficult.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Chinese word segmentation can be viewed as a stochastic transduction problem.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Previous reports on Chinese segmentation have invariably cited performance either in terms of a single percent-correct score, or else a single precision-recall pair.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Despite these limitations, a purely finite-state approach to Chinese word segmentation enjoys a number of strong advantages.</a></body>
