<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, seman­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for real­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowl­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as "antecedent indicators").</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The approach works as follows: it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the re­ maining candidates (see next section).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>}, the noun phrase immediately after V 1 is a very likely candidate for antecedent of the pronoun "it" imme­ diately following V2 and is therefore given preference (scores 2 and 0).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This measure (Mitkov 1998b) applies only to anaphors "ambiguous" from the point of view of number and gender (i.e. to those "tough" anaphors which, after activating the gender and number filters, still have more than one candidate for antecedent) and is indicative of the performance of the antecedent indicators.</a></body>
