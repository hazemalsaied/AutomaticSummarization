<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that effective incorporation of diverse features enables our system outperform previously best-reported systems on the 24 ACE relation subtypes and significantly outperforms tree kernel-based systems by over 20 in F-measure on the 5 ACE relation types.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>According to the scope of the NIST Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program, current research in IE has three main objectives: Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT), Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC), and Event Detection and Characterization (EDC).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information contributes to most of the performance inprovement from syntactic aspect while additional full parsing information does not contribute much, largely due to the fact that most of relations defined in ACE corpus are within a very short distance.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Yet further research work is still expected to make it effective with complicated relation extraction tasks such as the one defined in ACE.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper, we only measure the performance of relation extraction on “true” mentions with “true” chaining of coreference (i.e. as annotated by the corpus annotators) in the ACE corpus.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It also shows that our system achieves overall performance of 77.2%/60.7%/68.0 and 63.1%/49.5%/55.5 in precision/recall/F-measure on the 5 ACE relation types and the best-reported systems on the ACE corpus.</a></body>
