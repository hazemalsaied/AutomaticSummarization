<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Section 4 describes current state- of-the-art methods for Chinese word segmentation, with which our results were compared.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our word segmentation process is illustrated in Fig.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Since this work was to evaluate the proposed subword-based IOB tagging, we carried out the closed test only.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>71 6 0.9 64 0.9 72 Table 2: Segmentation results by a pure subword-based IOB tagging.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The segmentation results using CRF tagging are shown in Table 2, where the upper numbers of each slot were produced by the character-based approach while the lower numbers were of the subword-based.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of IOB tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We found the results in Table 3 were better than those in Table 2 and Table 1, which prove that using confidence measure approach achieved the best performance over the dictionary-based segmentation and the IOB tagging approach.</a>
