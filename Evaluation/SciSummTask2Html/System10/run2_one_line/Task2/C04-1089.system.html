<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As such, the bilingual lexicon of a machine translation system has to be constantly updated with these new word translations.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we present a new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In order for a machine translation system to translate these new words correctly, its bilingual lexicon needs to be constantly updated with new word translations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Comparable corpora refer to texts that are not direct translation but are about the same topic.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations, although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>When translating a word w, two sources of information can be used to determine its translation: the word w itself and the surrounding words in the neighborhood (i.e., the context) of w.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this paper, we propose a new approach for the task of mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining both context and transliteration information.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>On the other hand, when we only look at the word w itself, we can rely on the pronunciation of w to locate its translation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Since we are using comparable corpora, it is possible that the translation of a new word does not exist in the target corpus.</a></body>
