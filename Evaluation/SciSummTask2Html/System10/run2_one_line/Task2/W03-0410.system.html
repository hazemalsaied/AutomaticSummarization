<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In moving to a scenario of verb class discovery, using clustering, we face the problem of having a large number of irrelevant features for a particular clustering task.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the remainder of the paper, we first briefly review our feature space and present our experimental classes and verbs.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We use the same classes and example verbs as in the supervised experiments of Joanis and Stevenson (2003) to enable a comparison between the performance of the unsupervised and supervised methods.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>1 For practical reasons, as well as for enabling us to draw more general conclusions from the results, the classes also could neither be too small nor contain mostly infrequent verbs.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Because we make the simplifying assumption of a single correct classification for each verb, we also removed any verb: that was deemed excessively polysemous; that belonged to another class under consideration in our study; or for which the class did not correspond to the main sense.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As we have defined it, necessarily generally increases as the number of clusters increases, with the extreme being at the #verbs correctly classified #verbs total thus provides a measure of the usefulness in practice of a clustering—that is, if one were to use the clustering as a classification, this measure tells how accurate overall the class assignments would be.</a>
