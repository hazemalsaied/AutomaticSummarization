<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell & Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria & Stallard 1989; Lappin & McCord 1990; Lappin & Leass 1994; Mitkov 1994; Rich & LuperFoy 1988; Sidner 1979; Webber 1979).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Several proposals have already addressed the anaphora resolution problem by deliberately limiting the extent to which they rely on domain and/or lin­ guistic knowledge (Baldwin 1997; Dagan & ltai 1990; Kennedy & Boguraev 1996; Mitkov 1998; Nasukawa 1994; Williams et al. 1996).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, seman­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for real­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowl­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The algorithm for pronoun resolution can be de­ scribed informally as follows: 1.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the ap­ proach and to explore if I how far it is superior over the baseline models for anaphora resolution, we also tested the sample text on (i) a Baseline Model which checks agreement in number and gender and, where more than one candidate remains, picks as antece­ dent the most recent subject matching the gender and number of the anaphor (ii) a Baseline Model which picks as antecedent the most recent noun phrase that matches the gender and number of the anaphor.</a></body>
