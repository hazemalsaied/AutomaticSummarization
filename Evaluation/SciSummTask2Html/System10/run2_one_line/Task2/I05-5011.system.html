<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The accuracy of the sets in representing paraphrase ranged from 73% to 99%, depending on the NE categories and set sizes; the accuracy of the links for two evaluated domains was 73% and 86%.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Also, we donâ€™t know how many such paraphrase sets are necessary to cover even some everyday things or events.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If the same pair of NE instances is used with different phrases, these phrases are likely to be paraphrases.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system.</a>
