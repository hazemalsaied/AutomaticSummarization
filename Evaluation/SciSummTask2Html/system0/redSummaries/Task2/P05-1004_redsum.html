<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Each synonym votes for each of its super senses from WORDNET 1.6 using the similarity score from our synonym extractor . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For the noun hierarchy , there are 25 lex-files and a file containing the top level nodes in the hierarchy called Tops . </a>
