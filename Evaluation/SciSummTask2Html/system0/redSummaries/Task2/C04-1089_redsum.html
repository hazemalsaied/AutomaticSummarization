<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Knight and Graehl ( 1998 ) proposed a probabilistic model for machine transliteration . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In our translation problem , C ( c ) is viewed as the query and C ( e ) is viewed as a document . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper , we proposed a new method to mine new word translations from comparable corpora , by combining context and transliteration information , which are complementary sources of information . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This pronunciation is converted to source language pronunciation and then to source language word that our method estimates stead of P ( c | e ) and P ( e ) . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We evaluated our approach on six months of Chinese and English Gigaword corpora , with encouraging results . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Being more readily available , comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations , although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora . </a>
