<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Similar to word features , three categories of phrase heads are considered : 1 ) the phrase heads in between are also classified into three bins : the first phrase head in between , the last phrase head in between and other phrase heads in between ; 2 ) the phrase heads before M1 are classified into two bins : the first phrase head before and the second phrase head before ; 3 ) the phrase heads after M2 are classified into two bins : the first phrase head after and the second phrase head after . </a>
