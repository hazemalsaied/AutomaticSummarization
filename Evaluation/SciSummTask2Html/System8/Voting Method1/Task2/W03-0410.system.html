<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We cluster verbs into lexical semantic classes, using general set of noisy features that capture syntactic and semantic properties of the verbs.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The feature set was previously shown to work well in supervised learning setting, using known English verb classes.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Learning the argument structure properties of verbs—the semantic roles they assign and their mapping to syntactic positions—is both particularly important and difficult.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We investigate various approaches to feature selection, using both unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, comparing the results to subsets of features manually chosen according to linguistic properties.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It is also necessary to consider the probable lack of sophisticated grammars or text processing tools for extracting accurate features.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>By avoiding the dependence on precise feature extraction, our approach should be more portable to new languages.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, general feature space means that most features will be irrelevant to any given verb discrimination task.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We focus here on extending the applicability of unsupervised methods, as in (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), to the lexical semantic classification of verbs.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Thus, the problem of dimensionality reduction is key issue to be addressed in verb class discovery.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The Animacy Features (76 features) Semantic properties of the arguments that fill certain roles, such as animacy or motion, are more challenging to detect automatically.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Currently, our only such feature is an extension of the animacy feature of Merlo and Stevenson (2001).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Here we describe the selection of the experimental classes and verbs, and the estimation of the feature values.</a>
