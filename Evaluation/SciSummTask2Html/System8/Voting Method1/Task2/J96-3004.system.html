<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The initial stage of text analysis for any NLP task usually involves the tokenization of the input into words.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>orthographic words are thus only starting point for further analysis and can only be regarded as useful hint at the desired division of the sentence into words.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper we present stochastic finite-state model wherein the basic workhorse is the weighted finite-state transducer.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>raphy: ren2 'person' is fairly uncontroversial case of monographemic word, and rplil zhong1guo2 (middle country) 'China' fairly uncontroversial case of diÂ­ graphernic word.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Whether language even has orthographic words is largely dependent on the writing system used to represent the language (rather than the language itself); the notion "orthographic word" is not universal.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>pronunciations of individual words; they also need to compute intonational phrase boundaries in long utterances and assign relative prominence to words in those utterances.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The high tone of J1l would not normally neutralize in this fashion if it were functioning as word on its own.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It has been shown for English (Wang and Hirschberg 1992; Hirschberg 1993; Sproat 1994, inter alia) that grammatical part of speech provides useful information for these tasks.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The relevance of the distinction between, say, phonological words and, say, dictionary words is shown by an example like rpftl_A :;!:Hfllil zhong1hua2 ren2min2 gong4he2-guo2 (China people republic) 'People's Republic of China.'</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Making the reasonable assumption that similar information is relevant for solving these problems in Chinese, it follows that prerequisite for intonation-boundary assignment and prominence assignment is word segmentation.</a>
