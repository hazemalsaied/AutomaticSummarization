<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only very small degree of overlap.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or semiautomatic methods for the creation and maintenance of lexical-semantic resources.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere (location) is different to exo- sphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers of the earth’s atmosphere.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Also, lexical- semantic resources suffer from: bias towards concepts and senses from particular topics.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Lexicographers cannot possibly keep pace with language evolution: sense distinctions are continually made and merged, words are coined or become obsolete, and technical terms migrate into the vernacular.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Technical domains, such as medicine, require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings, and significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>These topic distinctions are coarser-grained than WORDNET senses, which have been criticised for being too difficult to distinguish even for experts.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNET’s hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained</a></body>
