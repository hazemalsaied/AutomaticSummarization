<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Evaluation reports success rate of 89.7% which is better than the suc­ cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In addition, preliminary experiments show that the approach can be success­ fully adapted for other languages with minimum modifications.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It is also an example of how anaphors in specific genre can be resolved quite successfully without any sophisticated linguistic knowledge or even without parsing.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our work is continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaph­ ora resolution.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The noun phrase with the highest aggregate score is proposed as antecedent; in the rare event of tie, priority is given to the candidate with the higher score for im­ mediate reference.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria Stallard 1989; Lappin McCord</a></body>
