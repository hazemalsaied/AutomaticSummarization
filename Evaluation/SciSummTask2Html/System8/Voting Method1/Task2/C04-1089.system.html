<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, various news agencies report major world events in different languages, and such news documents form readily available source of comparable corpora.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Comparable corpora refer to texts that are not direct translation but are about the same topic.</a>
