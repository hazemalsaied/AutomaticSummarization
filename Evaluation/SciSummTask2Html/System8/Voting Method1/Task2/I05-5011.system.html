<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If the expression is word or short phrase (like “corporation” and “company”), it is called “synonym”.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>So, it is too costly to make IE technology “open- domain” or “on-demand” like IR or QA.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from large untagged corpus.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The sentences in the corpus were tagged by transformation-based chunker and an NE tagger.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Next, for each pair of NE categories, we collect all the contexts and find the keywords which are topical for that NE category pair.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Finally, we find links between sets of phrases, based on the NE instance pair data (for example, different phrases which link “IBM” and “Lotus”) (Step 4).</a>
