<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The EDT task entails the detection of entity mentions and chaining them together by identifying their coreference.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example, we want to determine whether person is at location, based on the evidence in the context.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The RDC task detects and classifies implicit and explicit relations1 between entities identified by the EDT task.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet (Miller 1990) and Name List can be used in the feature-based framework.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Implicit relations need not have explicit supporting evidence in text, though they should be evident from reading of the document.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Finally, we present experimental setting and results in Section and conclude with some general observations in relation extraction in Section 6.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Extraction of semantic relationships between entities can be very useful for applications such as question answering, e.g. to answer the query “Who is the president of the United States?”.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Zhang (2004) approached relation classification by combining various lexical and syntactic features with bootstrapping on top of Support Vector Machines.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Miller et al (2000) augmented syntactic full parse trees with semantic information corresponding to entities and relations, and built generative models for the augmented trees.</a>
