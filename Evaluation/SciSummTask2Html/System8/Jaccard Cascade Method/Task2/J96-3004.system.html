<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The initial stage of text analysis for any NLP task usually involves the tokenization of the input into words.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For languages like English one can assume, to a first approximation, that word boundaries are given by whitespace or punctuation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In various Asian languages, including Chinese, on the other hand, whitespace is never used to delimit words, so one must resort to lexical information to "reconstruct" the word-boundary information.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper we present a stochastic finite-state model wherein the basic workhorse is the weighted finite-state transducer.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The model segments Chinese text into dictionary entries and words derived by various productive lexical processes, and--since the primary intended application of this model is to text-to-speech synthesis--provides pronunciations for these words.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We evaluate the system's performance by comparing its segmentation 'Tudgments" with the judgments of a pool of human segmenters, and the system is shown to perform quite well.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Any NLP application that presumes as input unrestricted text requires an initial phase of text analysis; such applications involve problems as diverse as machine translation, information retrieval, and text-to-speech synthesis (TIS).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>An initial step of any textÂ­ analysis task is the tokenization of the input into words.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For a language like English, this problem is generally regarded as trivial since words are delimited in English text by whitespace or marks of punctuation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Thus in an English sentence such as I'm going to show up at the ACL one would reasonably conjecture that there are eight words separated</a></body>
