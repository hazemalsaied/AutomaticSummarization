<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledge­ based system, however, is that it is a very labour­ intensive and time-consuming task.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This paper pres­ ents a robust, knowledge-poor approach to resolving pronouns in technical manuals, which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Input is checked against agreement and for a number of antecedent indicators.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Evaluation reports a success rate of 89.7% which is better than the suc­ cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition, preliminary experiments show that the approach can be success­ fully adapted for other languages with minimum modifications.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell & Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria & Stallard 1989; Lappin & McCord 1990; Lappin & Leass 1994; Mitkov 1994; Rich & LuperFoy 1988; Sidner 1979; Webber 1979).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>While various alternatives have been proposed, making use of e.g. neural networks, a situation se­ mantics framework, or the principles of reasoning with uncertainty (e.g. Connoly et al. 1994; Mitkov 1995; Tin & Akman 1995), there is still a strong need for the development of robust</a></body>
