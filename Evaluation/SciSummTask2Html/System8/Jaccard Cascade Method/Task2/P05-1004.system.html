<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is a significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Supersense tagging assigns unknown nouns one of 26 broad semantic categories used by lexicographers to organise their manual insertion into WORDNET.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present a tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We describe an unsupervised approach, based on vector-space similarity, which does not require annotated examples but significantly outperforms their tagger.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We also demonstrate the use of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for calculating vector-space semantic similarity.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In particular, WORDNET (Fellbaum, 1998) has significantly influenced research in NLP.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Unfortunately, these resource are extremely time- consuming and labour-intensive to manually develop and maintain, requiring considerable linguistic and domain expertise.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Lexicographers cannot possibly keep pace with language evolution: sense distinctions are continually made and merged, words are coined or become obsolete, and technical terms migrate into the vernacular.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Technical domains, such as medicine, require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings, and a significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary.</a>
