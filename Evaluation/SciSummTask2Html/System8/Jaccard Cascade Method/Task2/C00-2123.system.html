<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we describe a search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT) based on dynamic programming (DP).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Starting from a DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem, we present a novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language in order to achieve an e√Ücient search algorithm.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task (GermanEnglish, 8000-word vocabulary), which is a limited-domain spoken-language task.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We are given a source string fJ 1 = f1:::fj :::fJ of length J, which is to be translated into a target string eI 1 = e1:::ei:::eI of length I. Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability: ^eI 1 = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1jfJ 1 )g = arg max eI 1 fPr(eI 1) Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1)g : (1) The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Pr(eI 1) is the language model of the target language, whereas Pr(fJ 1 jeI1) is the transla tion model.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Our approach uses word-to-word dependencies between source and target words.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The model is often further restricted so that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word (Brown et</a></body>
