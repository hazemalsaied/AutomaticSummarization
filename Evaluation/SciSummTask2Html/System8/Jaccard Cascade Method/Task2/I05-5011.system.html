<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The first stage identifies a keyword in each phrase and joins phrases with the same keyword into sets.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The second stage links sets which involve the same pairs of individual NEs.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A total of 13,976 phrases were grouped.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The accuracy of the sets in representing paraphrase ranged from 73% to 99%, depending on the NE categories and set sizes; the accuracy of the links for two evaluated domains was 73% and 86%.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>One of the difficulties in Natural Language Processing is the fact that there are many ways to express the same thing or event.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If the expression is a word or a short phrase (like “corporation” and “company”), it is called a “synonym”.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>There has been a lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If the expression is longer or complicated (like “A buys B” and “A’s purchase of B”), it is called “paraphrase”, i.e. a set of phrases which express the same thing or event.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.</a>
