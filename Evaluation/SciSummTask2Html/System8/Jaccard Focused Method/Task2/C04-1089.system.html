<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper, we present new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We evaluated our approach on six months of Chinese and English Gigaword corpora, with encouraging results.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In order for machine translation system to translate these new words correctly, its bilingual lexicon needs to be constantly updated with new word translations.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For example, various news agencies report major world events in different languages, and such news documents form readily available source of comparable corpora.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Comparable corpora refer to texts that are not direct translation but are about the same topic.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For example, the work of (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002a; AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of in translation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>New words such as person names, organization names, technical terms, etc. appear frequently.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>While we have only tested our method on Chinese-English comparable corpora, our method is general and applicable to other language pairs.</a>
