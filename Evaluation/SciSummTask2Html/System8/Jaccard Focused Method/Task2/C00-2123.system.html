<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper, we describe search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT) based on dynamic programming (DP).</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task (GermanEnglish, 8000-word vocabulary), which is limited-domain spoken-language task.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The goal of machine translation is the translation of text given in some source language into target language.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Pr(eI 1) is the language model of the target language, whereas Pr(fJ jeI1) is the transla tion model.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These alignment models are similar to the concept of hidden Markov models (HMM) in speech recognition.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Word Re-ordering and DP-based Search in Statistical Machine Translation</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The model is often further restricted so that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word (Brown et al., 1993; Ney et al., 2000).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In Section 4, we present the performance measures used and give translation results on the Verbmobil task.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This approach is compared to another reordering scheme presented in (Berger et al., 1996).</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In Section 3, we introduce our novel concept to word reordering and DP-based search, which is especially suitable for the translation direction from German to English.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Our approach uses word-to-word dependencies between source and target words.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In Section 2, we brie review our approach to statistical machine translation.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(1), Pr(eI 1) is the language model, which is trigram language model in this case.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>When aligning the words in parallel texts (for language pairs like SpanishEnglish, French-English, ItalianGerman,...), we typically observe strong localization effect.</a></body>
