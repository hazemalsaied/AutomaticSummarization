<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Current approaches to English classifica­ tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limita­ tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have preliminary indications that the membership of our intersective sets will be more compatible with WordNet than the orig­ inal Levin classes.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We also have begun to ex­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The only escape from this lim­ itation will be through the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisi­ tion.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The difficulty of achieving adequate hand­ crafted semantic representations has limited the field of natural language processing to applica­ tions that can be contained within well-defined subdomains.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We see verb classes as the key to making gen­ eralizations about regular extensions of mean­ ing.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>What constitutes clear sepa­ ration into senses for any one verb, and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished?</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We base these regular extensions on fine-grained variation on Levin classes, inter­ sective Levin classes, as source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts.</a>
