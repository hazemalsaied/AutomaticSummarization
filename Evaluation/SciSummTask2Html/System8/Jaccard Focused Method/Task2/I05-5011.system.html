<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If the expression is word or short phrase (like “corporation” and “company”), it is called “synonym”.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>There has been lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Also, we don’t know how many such paraphrase sets are necessary to cover even some everyday things or events.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The second stage links sets which involve the same pairs of individual NEs.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>So, there is limitation that IE can only be performed for predefined task, like “corporate mergers” or “management succession”.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>So, it is too costly to make IE technology “open- domain” or “on-demand” like IR or QA.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from large untagged corpus.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In order to create an IE system for new domain, one has to spend long time to create the knowledge.</a>
