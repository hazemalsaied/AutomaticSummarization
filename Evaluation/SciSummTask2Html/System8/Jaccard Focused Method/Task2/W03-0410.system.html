<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We cluster verbs into lexical semantic classes, using general set of noisy features that capture syntactic and semantic properties of the verbs.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The feature set was previously shown to work well in supervised learning setting, using known English verb classes.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In moving to scenario of verb class discovery, using clustering, we face the problem of having large number of irrelevant features for particular clustering task.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Learning the argument structure properties of verbs—the semantic roles they assign and their mapping to syntactic positions—is both particularly important and difficult.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Computational linguists face lexical acquisition bottleneck, as vast amounts of knowledge about individual words are required for language technologies.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We investigate various approaches to feature selection, using both unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, comparing the results to subsets of features manually chosen according to linguistic properties.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, the semi- supervised approach (using seed set of sample verbs) overall outperforms not only the full set of features, but the hand-selected features as well.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As such, they serve as means for organizing complex knowledge about verbs in computational lexicon (Kipper et al., 2000).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It is also necessary to consider the probable lack of sophisticated grammars or text processing tools for extracting accurate features.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We have previously shown that broad set of 220 noisy features performs well in supervised verb classification (Joanis and Stevenson, 2003).</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We find that the unsupervised method we tried cannot be consistently applied to our data.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>However, creating verb classification is highly resource intensive, in terms of both required time and linguistic expertise.</a></body>
