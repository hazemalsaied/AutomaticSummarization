<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper investigates the incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using SVM.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In ACE vocabulary, entities are objects, mentions are references to them, and relations are semantic relationships between entities.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The EDT task entails the detection of entity mentions and chaining them together by identifying their coreference.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, we want to determine whether person is at location, based on the evidence in the context.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The RDC task detects and classifies implicit and explicit relations1 between entities identified by the EDT task.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Information Extraction (IE) systems are expected to identify relevant information (usually of predefined types) from text documents in certain domain and put them in structured format.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet (Miller 1990) and Name List can be used in the feature-based framework.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Entities can be of five types: persons, organizations, locations, facilities and geopolitical entities (GPE: geographically defined regions that indicate political boundary, e.g. countries, states, cities, etc.).</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Implicit relations need not have explicit supporting evidence in text, though they should be evident from reading of the document.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This paper focuses on the ACE RDC task and employs diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using Support Vector</a></body>
