<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Supersense tagging assigns unknown nouns one of 26 broad semantic categories used by lexicographers to organise their manual insertion into WORDNET.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We describe an unsupervised approach, based on vector-space similarity, which does not require annotated examples but significantly outperforms their tagger.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Unfortunately, these resource are extremely time- consuming and labour-intensive to manually develop and maintain, requiring considerable linguistic and domain expertise.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only very small degree of overlap.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We also demonstrate the use of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for calculating vector-space semantic similarity.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every sentences in the BLLIP corpus.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or semiautomatic methods for the creation and maintenance of lexical-semantic resources.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>By WORDNET 2.0, coverage has improved but the problem of keeping up with language evolution remains difficult.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere (location) is different to exo- sphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers of the earthâ€™s atmosphere.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For the noun hierarchy, there are 25 lex-files and file containing the top level nodes in the hierarchy called Tops.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This approach significantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6</a></body>
