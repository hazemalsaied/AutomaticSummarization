<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: subword-based tagging and confidence measure approach.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In addition, the latter can be used to balance out-of-vocabulary rates and in-vocabulary rates.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If only Chinese characters are used, the subword-based IOB tagging is downgraded into character-based one.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, higher IV rate is also desired.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with dictionary-based segmentation.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>By this approach we can change R-oovs and R-ivs and find an optimal tradeoff.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We will give detailed description of this approach in Section 2.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Section describes current state- of-the-art methods for Chinese word segmentation, with which our results were compared.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In this work we propose confidence measure approach to lessen the weakness.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The character-based “IOB” tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Taking the same example mentioned above, (whole) (Beijing city)” is labeled as (whole)/O (Beijing)/B (city)/I” in the subword-based tagging, where</a></body>
