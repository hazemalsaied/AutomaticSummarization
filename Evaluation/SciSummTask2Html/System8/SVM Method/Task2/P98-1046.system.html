<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We see verb classes as the key to making gen­ eralizations about regular extensions of mean­ ing.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Current approaches to English classifica­ tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limita­ tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We present refinement of Levin classes, intersec­ tive sets, which are more fine-grained clas­ sification and have more coherent sets of syn­ tactic frames and associated semantic compo­ nents.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We have preliminary indications that the membership of our intersective sets will be more compatible with WordNet than the orig­ inal Levin classes.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The only escape from this lim­ itation will be through the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisi­ tion.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The difficulty of determining suitable lexical representation becomes multi­ plied when more than one language is involved and attempts are made to map between them.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Preliminary investigations have indicated that straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996).</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>However, we have found interesting par­ allels in how Portuguese and English treat reg­ ular sense extensions.</a>
