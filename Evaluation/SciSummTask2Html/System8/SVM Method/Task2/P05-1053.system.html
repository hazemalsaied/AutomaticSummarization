<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Extracting semantic relationships between entities is challenging.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This paper investigates the incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using SVM.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that effective incorporation of diverse features enables our system outperform previously best-reported systems on the 24 ACE relation subtypes and significantly outperforms tree kernel-based systems by over 20 in F-measure on the ACE relation types.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>According to the scope of the NIST Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program, current research in IE has three main objectives: Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT), Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC), and Event Detection and Characterization (EDC).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The EDT task entails the detection of entity mentions and chaining them together by identifying their coreference.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The RDC task detects and classifies implicit and explicit relations1 between entities identified by the EDT task.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For example, we want to determine whether person is at location, based on the evidence in the context.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Extraction of semantic relationships between entities can be very useful for applications such as question answering, e.g. to answer the query “Who is the president of the United States?”.</a>
