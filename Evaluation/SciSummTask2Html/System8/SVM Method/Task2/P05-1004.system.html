<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Lexicographers cannot possibly keep pace with language evolution: sense distinctions are continually made and merged, words are coined or become obsolete, and technical terms migrate into the vernacular.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Technical domains, such as medicine, require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings, and significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only very small degree of overlap.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Also, lexical- semantic resources suffer from: bias towards concepts and senses from particular topics.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Some specialist topics are better covered in WORD- NET than others, e.g. dog has finer-grained distinctions than cat and worm although this does not reflect finer distinctions in reality; limited coverage of infrequent words and senses.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere (location) is different to exo- sphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers of the earthâ€™s atmosphere.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or semiautomatic methods for the creation and maintenance of lexical-semantic resources.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Broad semantic classification is currently used by lexicographers to or- ganise the manual insertion of words into WORDNET, and is an experimental precursor to automatically inserting words directly into the WORDNET hierarchy.</a>
