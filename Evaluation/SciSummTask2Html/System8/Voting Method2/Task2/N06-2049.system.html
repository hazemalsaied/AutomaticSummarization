<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: subword-based tagging and confidence measure approach.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with dictionary-based segmentation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this work we propose subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Taking the same example mentioned above, (whole) (Beijing city)” is labeled as (whole)/O (Beijing)/B (city)/I” in the subword-based tagging, where (Beijing)/B” is labeled as one unit.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In addition, the latter can be used to balance out-of-vocabulary rates and in-vocabulary rates.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition, we found clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach: It yields very low in-vocabulary (IV) rate (R-iv) in return for higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate (R-oov).</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.</a>
