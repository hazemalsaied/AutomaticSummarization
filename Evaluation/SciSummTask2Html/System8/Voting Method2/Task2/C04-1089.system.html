Most previous research only considers one of the two sources of information, but not both.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As such, the bilingual lexicon of machine translation system has to be constantly updated with these new word translations.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Comparable corpora such as news documents of the same period from different news agencies are readily available.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations, although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Comparable corpora refer to texts that are not direct translation but are about the same topic.</a>
