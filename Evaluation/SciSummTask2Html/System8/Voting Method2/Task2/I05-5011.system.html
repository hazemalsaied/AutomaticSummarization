<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the expression is longer or complicated (like “A buys B” and “A’s purchase of B”), it is called “paraphrase”, i.e. set of phrases which express the same thing or event.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.</a>
