<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We cluster verbs into lexical semantic classes, using general set of noisy features that capture syntactic and semantic properties of the verbs.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We investigate various approaches to feature selection, using both unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, comparing the results to subsets of features manually chosen according to linguistic properties.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We focus here on extending the applicability of unsupervised methods, as in (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), to the lexical semantic classification of verbs.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper, we report results on several feature selection approaches to the problem: manual selection (based on linguistic knowledge), unsupervised selection (based on an entropy measure among the features, Dash et al., 1997), and semi- supervised approach (in which seed verbs are used to train supervised learner, from which we extract the useful features).</a>
