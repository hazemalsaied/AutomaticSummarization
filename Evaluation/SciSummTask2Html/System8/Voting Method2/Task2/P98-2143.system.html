<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The approach works as follows: it takes as an input the output of text processed by part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within distance of sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the re­ maining candidates (see next section).</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>One of the disadvantages of developing knowledge­ based system, however, is that it is very labour­ intensive and time-consuming task.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While various alternatives have been proposed, making use of e.g. neural networks, situation se­ mantics framework, or the principles of reasoning with uncertainty (e.g. Connoly et al. 1994; Mitkov 1995; Tin Akman 1995), there is still strong need for the development of robust and effective strategies to meet the demands of practical NLP systems, and to enhance further the automatic pro­ cessing of growing language resources.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Evaluation reports success rate of 89.7% which is better than the suc­ cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Robust pronoun resolution with limited knowledge</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Input is checked against agreement and for number of antecedent indicators.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria Stallard 1989; Lappin McCord 1990; Lappin Leass 1994; Mitkov 1994; Rich LuperFoy 1988; Sidner</a></body>
