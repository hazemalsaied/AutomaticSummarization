<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Broad semantic classification is currently used by lexicographers to or- ganise the manual insertion of words into WORDNET, and is an experimental precursor to automatically inserting words directly into the WORDNET hierarchy.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only very small degree of overlap.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Some specialist topics are better covered in WORD- NET than others, e.g. dog has finer-grained distinctions than cat and worm although this does not reflect finer distinctions in reality; limited coverage of infrequent words and senses.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Technical domains, such as medicine, require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings, and significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Lexicographers cannot possibly keep pace with language evolution: sense distinctions are continually made and merged, words are coined or become obsolete, and technical terms migrate into the vernacular.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNET’s hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere (location) is different to exo- sphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers of the earth’s atmosphere.</a>
