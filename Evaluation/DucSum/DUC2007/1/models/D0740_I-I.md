Piccard and Jones crossed the finish line at 4:54 EST Saturday, first to circumnavigate the world in a balloon and setting a nonstop circumnavigation record.
They landed in southern Egypt Sunday morning, March 21st, after 19 days, 21 hours, 47-55 minutes aloft, flying 29,055 miles.
They punctured the balloon to keep from being dragged across the desolate desert, then waited 7 hours to be picked up.
The lightweight plastic Rozier balloon has bags containing helium and air and a 16x10-foot capsule.
It will permanently reside at the Air and Space Museum in Washington.
The balloonists will receive the Olympic Order.
