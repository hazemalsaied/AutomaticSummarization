The Australian Government criticized the UN committee's report on the Kakadu National Park, calling it biased and unbalanced.
They said they were satisfied with their processes for approval of the mine and found no threat to Kakadu, citing the nearby Ranger uranium mine that had operated 20 years without adverse impact.
In Kyoto the UN committee called for scrapping the mine over its impact on Kakudu's cultural and natural values.
The committee ordered Australian authorities to reveal actions taken to mitigate threats posed by the mine.
If they were unsatisfactory the committee would recommend Kakadu's inclusion on the endangered list.
