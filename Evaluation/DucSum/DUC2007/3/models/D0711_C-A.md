In April 2000, 48 hours after the collapse of settlement talks, the judge made his finding of law: Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act through predatory and anticompetitive behavior and by keeping "an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune".
Microsoft announced that it would appeal.
The government and states were asked to provide recommendations for remedy for the court's consideration which they did: split Microsoft into two companies-one for Windows and one for everything else.
In early June the judge ordered the split and Microsoft said it would appeal.
