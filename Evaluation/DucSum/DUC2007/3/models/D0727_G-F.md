Bizek was not deposed but agreed to reveal some, but not all, of Newt's gifts and turned over some documents to Marianne.
In December the couple attended a court- ordered mediation, the couple's first meeting since the split.
Newt was prepared to split their assets and pay alimony and went into the mediation with an open mind.
After 12 hours of negotiation the couple agreed to a confidential settlement.
The settlement culminated with Newt's admission of a 6-year affair and avoided an embarrassing public divorce.
Three months later the final divorce settlement was signed.
Newt Married Callista in August 2000.
