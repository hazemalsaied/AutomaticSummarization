Strong tremors continued to shake the region after the quake and people panicked when another strong earthquake hit the same region about a year later.
Most Turks believed that the government had done a good job in the post-quake cleanup.
About 26,000 survivors were living in tent cities that had initially held some 120,000; and some 150,00 people were still in prefabricated houses.
The state was providing rent subsidies as well as free meals to some survivors.
In case of another quake the government had taken extensive measures such as setting up mobile rescue teams and coordination headquarters.
