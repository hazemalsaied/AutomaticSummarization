When a NODE node 1 has a NODE node 2 as its FORWARD value , the other contents of tile node 1 are ignored and tim contents of node 2 are used . 

t { however when a NODE has another NODE as its COPY value , the contents of the COPY value are used only when the COPY value is cub : rent . 

The revised CopyNode procedure takes as its inputs the node to be copied node I and the arc arc I with node I as its value and node 2 as its immediate ancestor node ( i.e. , the arc 's initial node ) , and does the following ( set Fig . 

FOR ALL arc IN nodes DO IF NotNIL ? ( new arc FindArc ( archangel new arcs ) THEN AddArc ( new node Newark undervalue . 

Method In a system where FS unification is applied , there are features whose values fail relatively often in unification with other values and there are features whose values do not fail so often . 

( 2 ) Number of features FSs have : if each FS has only a small number of features , the efficiency gain from the SING unification method is small . 

The Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph ( SLING ) Unification methods combines two Incremental Copy Graph Unification methods : the Lazy Incremental Copy Graph ( LING ) Unification methods and the Strategic Incremental Copy Graph ( SING ) Unification methods .
