THE CORRECT AND EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION OF APPROPRIATENESS SPECIFICATIONS FOR TYPED FEATURE STRUCTURES
there are a number of different constraint languages within feature structure frameworks ( e.g. , Alshawi et al . 1991 ; Carpenter 1992 ; Dorre and Eisle 1991 ; Emele and Zajac 1990 ; Gerdemann and King 1994 ; Krieger and Schafer 1994 ; de Paiva 1993 ; Smolka 1989 ) . 
Legerdemain and G6tz 's Troll system ( see [ G6Tz 1993 ] , [ GFRDEIVIANN AND KING 1994 ] and [ GERDEMANN ( FC ) ] ) employs an efficient refinement of RES to test the satisfiability of feature structures . 
Thus , though RES is computationally expensive , Troll uses RES only during compilation , never during run time . 
Unification lbrmMisms may be either un-typed ( DCC~s , PATRII , 1 , F ( ; ) or typed ( npsG ) . 
A m~L , ior reason for adding types to ~ form ism is to express restrictions on feature a.s in ( ; l 's ( : : [ 5 ] in order to rule out nonexistent ) es of objects . 
For example , there are no verbs which have the [ mixture . The simplest way to express such restrictions is by means of a.n appropriateness function : Type ร Feat ~ Type . 
With such a.n ample rol ) brittleness son Sllch restriction s may be expressed , though no restrictions involving entrances be expressed . 
In this pal ) er , we will first in ยง2 survey the range of type constraints may be expressed with just a. type hierarchy and * ' ] 'he research ( ! lllL ( 'd ill | , his ; paper was pay tidally sponsored hy ' [ subproject `` ( ; onsl.rahH.s on Grammar flora Efficient Ck : generation of the Soi , der forschungsbereich 340 of the Deutsche [ `` orschungsgemeinscha ft. `` VVe would also like to thank Shiloh for help l comments ou thc ideas presented here .

Then in ~3 , we discuss how such type constraints linty be maintained under unification as exemplified in the na.tura. 1 language D~rs- generation system '.l'ro l [ 7 ] . 
1 Unlike previous systems such as ALl , : , Troll does not employ any type inferencing inste~M , a , limited amount of named disjunction ( [ 1 1 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 6 ] ) is introduced to record type resolved u son possibilities . 
The amount of dis- junction is also kept small by the technique of unwilling g described in [ 9 ] . 
This strategy actually apl ) appropriateness conditions in some cases in which a. type in-ferencing strategy would fail l ) 'inMly , in ยง4 , we discuss the possibilities for genera Lizzie this ample roach to handle a bro~Mer ringer of constraints including constraints inw ) ling ties .

well-typable iff the feature structure subsumes a well-typed feature structure , in ALl . : , type inferencing is employed to ensure that all feature structures are well-typable -- in fact , all feature structures are well typed . 
Let type resolution be the total function R : - > DRFS such that R ( F ) is the set of all resolved of F. Guided by the partition and all-or-nothing conditions , King [ 13 ] has formulated a semantics of feature structures and developed a notion of a satisfiable feature structure such that F E FS is satisfiable iff R ( F ) 0 . 
The Troll system , which is based on this idea , effectively implements type resolution . 
Why does type resorption succeed where . 
types inferencing fails ?
