<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The most important result that has undergone a change between van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) and our current experiments is the relative accuracy of TagPair and stacked systems such as MBL . </a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) we used a straightforward imÂ­ implementation of HMM 's , which turned out to have the worst accuracy of the four competing methods . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As we now apply the methods of van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) to WSJ as well , it is easier to make a comparison . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Compare this to the `` tune '' set in van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The first is the LOB corpus ( Johansson 1986 ) , which we used in the earlier experiments as well ( van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans 1998 ) and which has proved to be a good testing ground . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Traditionally , these models were categorized as either rule-based/symbolic or corpus-based/probabilistic . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This is much easier and can quickly lead to a model which produces results with a reasonably good quality . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A next step is to examine them in pairs . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>When a data driven method is used , a model is automatically learned from the implicit structure of an annotated training corpus . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Since this model has no facilities for handling unknown words , a Memory-Based system ( see below ) is used to propose distributions of potential tags for words not in the lexicon . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Improving Data Driven Wordclass Tagging by System Combination</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>With LOB and a single 114K tune set ( van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans 1998 ) , both MBL and Decision Trees degraded significantly when adding context , and MBL degraded when adding the word </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Component taggers In 1992 , van Halteren combined a number of taggers by way of a straightforward majority vote ( cf . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>When used on Test , the pairwise voting strategy ( TagPair ) clearly outperforms the other voting strategies , 8 but does not yet approach the level where all tying majority votes are handled correctly ( 98.31 % ) . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>For our experiment , we divide the corpus into three parts . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Four well-known tagger generators (Hidden Markov Model, Memory-Based, Transformation Rules and Maximum Entropy) are trained on the same corpus data.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>For part-of-speech tagging , a significant increase in accuracy through combining the output of different taggers was first demonstrated in van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) and Brill and Wu ( 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The second system is the Transformation Based Learning system as described by Brill ( 19941 ; henceforth tagger R , for Rules ) . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>That this is indeed the case can be seen in Table 1 . </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>After comparison, their outputs are combined using several voting strategies and second stage classifiers.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>After comparison , their outputs are combined using several voting strategies and second stage classifiers . </a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>When combining the taggers , every tagger pair is taken in turn and allowed to vote ( with the probability described above ) for each possible tag , i.e . not just the ones suggested by the component taggers . </a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Stacked classifiers From the measurements so far it appears that the use of more detailed information leads to a better accuracy improvement . </a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>We will execute our investigation by means of an experiment . </a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>The practice of feeding the outputs of a number of classifiers as features for a next learner sit is significantly better than the runner-up ( Precision-Recall ) with p=0 . </a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Finally , a number of rather different methods are available that generate a fully functional tagging system from annotated text . </a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Note that with this method ( and those in the next section ) a tag suggested by a minority ( or even none ) of the taggers still has a chance to win . </a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>It has been shown that , when the errors are uncorrelated to a sufficient degree , the resulting combined classifier will often perform better than all the individual systems ( Ali and Pazzani 1996 ; Chan and Stolfo 1995 ; Tumer and Gosh 1996 ) . </a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>In all Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) systems , we find one or more language models which are used to predict , classify Andros interpret language related observations . </a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>The quality of the individual taggers cf . </a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Here we use a slight adaptation of the tagger . </a>

<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>Recent work ( e.g . Brill 1992 ) has demonstrated clearly that this categorization is in fact a mix-up of two distinct Categorization systems : on the one hand there is the representation used for the language model ( rules , Markov model , neural net , case base , etc . ) and on the other hand the manner in which the model is constructed ( hand crafted vs. data driven ) . </a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>tokens , but , because of a 92.5 % agreement over all four taggers , it yielded less than 9K tokens of useful training material to resolve disagreements . </a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>This was suspected to be the main reason for the relative lack of performance by the more sophisticated combiners . </a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>Both Tune and Test contain around 2.5 % new tokens ( wrt Train ) and a further 0.2 % known tokens with new tags . </a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>However , it appears more useful to give more weight to taggers which have proved their quality . </a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>In both approaches , different tagger genÂ­ aerators were applied to the same training data and their predictions combined using different combination methods , including stacking . </a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Obviously there is still room for a closer examination of the differences between the combination methods , e.g . the question whether Memory-Based combination would have performed better if we had provided more training data than just Tune , and of the remaining errors , e.g . the effects of inconsistency in the data ( cf . </a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>Simple Voting There are many ways in which the results of the component taggers can be combined , selecting a single tag from the set proposed by these taggers . </a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>Since the component taggers all used n-gram statistics to model context probabilities and the knowledge representation was hence fundamentally the same in each component , the results were limited . </a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>We can investigate all situations where one tagger suggests T1 and the other T2 and estimate the probability that in this situation the tag should actually be Tx . </a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>Where TagPair used to be significantly better than MBL , the roles are now well reversed . </a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>12Although not significantly better , e.g . the differences within the group ME/ER/ET are not significant . </a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>The data we use for our experiment consists of the tagged LOB corpus ( Johansson 1986 ) . </a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>For the first two the similarity metric used during tagging is a straightforward overlap count ; for the third we need to use an Information Gain weighting ( Daelemans ct al . 1997 ) . </a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>We do this by means of an experiment involving the task of morpho-syntactic word class tagging . </a></body>
