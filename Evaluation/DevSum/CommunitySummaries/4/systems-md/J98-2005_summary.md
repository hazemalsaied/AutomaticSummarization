a treebank PCFG whose simple relative frequency estimator corresponds to maximumlikelihood ( Chi and Geman 1998 ) , and which we shall refer to as `` MLPCFG '' . 
Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm . 
Such maximization provides the estimator ( see for instance ( Chi and Geman , 1998 ) ) pG ( A ? a ) =f ( A ? a , T ) f ( A , T ) . 
This result been firstly shown in ( Chaudhuri et al. , 1983 ) and later , with a different proof technique , in ( Chi and Geman , 1998 ) . 
( Wetherell and others use the designation `` consistent '' instead of `` tight , '' but in statistics , consistency refers to the asymptotic correctness of an estimator . ) 
impose proper probability distributions on D ( Chi and Geman 1998 ) . 
In the simple example here , the estimator converges in one step and is the same ~ as if we had observed the entire parse tree for each wi . 
We will show that in both cases the estimated probability is tight . 
Evidently the likelihood is unaffected by the particular assignment of fi ( B -- ~ fl ) . 
Blum 1972 ] first introduced it for hidden Markov models ( regular grammars ) and Baker [ 1979 ] extended it to the problem addressed here ( estimation for context-free grammars ) . 
If , however , the language of the grammar does not include the null string , then there is an equivalent grammar ( one with the same language ) that has no null productions and no unit productions ( cf . 
This iteration procedure is an instance of the EM Algorithm . 
This solves a problem that was left open in the literature ( Chi and Geman,1998 ) 
Proof The proof is almost identical to the one given by Chi and Ceman ( 1998 ) . 
What if the production probabilities are estimated from data ? 
In the usual way , probabilities are introduced through the productions : P : R -- ~ [ 0,1 ] such that VA E V : p ( A -~ c~ ) = 1 . 
This simple estimator , as shown by Chi and Geman ( 1998 ) , assigns proper production probÂ­ abilities for PCFGs . 
Hence qs = 0 , completing the proof of the theorem . 
( We use R in place of the more typical P to avoid confusion with probabilities . )
