<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In ( Erkan and Radev , 2004 ) , we introduce method and successfully applied it generic multi-document summarization . </a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>3.1 The LexRank method . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In the new approach , the 916 score of a sentence is determined by a mixture model of the relevance of the sentence to the query and the similarity of the sentence to other high-scoring sentences . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our model is similar in spirit to the random- walk summarization model ( Otterbacher et al. , 2005 ) . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Once the similarity graph constructed the sentences are then ranked according to their eigenvector centrality . </a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Below , we describe a topic-sensitive version of LexRank , which is more appropriate for the question-focusedsentence retrieval problem . </a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>As previously mentioned , the original LexRank method performed welling the context of generic summarization . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In the training phase the experiment , we evaluated all combination with d in the range of [ 0 , 1 ] ( in increments of 0.10 ) and with a similarity threshold ranging from [ 0 , 0.9 ] ( in increments of 0.05 ) . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>We presented topic-sensitive LexRank and applied it to the problem of Sentence Retrieval . </a></body>
