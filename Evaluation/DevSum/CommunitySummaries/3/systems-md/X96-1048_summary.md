Any participant in a future MUC evaluation faces the challenge of providing a named entity identification capability that would score in the 90th percentile on the F-measure on a task such as the MUC6 one . 
The introduction of two new tasks into the MUC evaluations and the restructuring of information extraction into two separate tasks have infused new life into the evaluations . 
Many of the sites have emphasized their pattern-matching techniques in discussing the strengths of their MUC6 systems . 
Even the simplest of the tasks , Named Entity , occasionally requires in-depth processing , e.g. , to determine whether `` 60 pounds '' is an expression of weight or of monetary value . 
( BBN system ) Table 5 . 
All the participating sites also submitted systems for evaluation on the TE and NE tasks . 
This period comprised the `` evaluation epoch . '' 
The text filtering results for MUC6 , MUC4 ( TST4 ) and MUC3 ( TST2 ) are shown in figure 8 . 
For MUC6 , text filtering scores were as high as 98 % recall ( with precision in the 80th percentile ) or 96 % precision ( with recall in the 80th percentile ) . 
Finally , a change in administration of the MUC evaluations is occurring that will bring fresh ideas . 
Documentation of each of the tasks and summary scores for all systems evaluated can be found in the MUC6 proceedings [ 1 ] . 
As indicated in table 2 , all systems performed better on identifying person names than on identifying organization or location names , and all but a few systems performed better on location names than on organization names . 
The NE evaluation results serve mainly to document in the MUC context what was already strongly suspected : 1 . 
This capability has other useful applications as well , e.g. , it enables text highlighting in a browser . 
CORPUS Testing was conducted using Wall Street Journal texts provided by the Linguistic Data Consortium . 
The basis of the third event comes halfway through the two-page article : In addition , Peter Kim was hired from WPP Group 's J. Walter Thompson last September as vice chairman , chief strategy officer , worldwide . 
Statistically , large differences of up to 15 points may not be reflected as a difference in the ranking of the systems . 
Systems scored approximately 1525 points lower ( F-measure ) on ST than on TE . 
Frequently , at least one can be found in close proximity to an organization 's name , e.g. , as an appositive ( `` Creative Artists Agency , the big Hollywood talent agency '' ) .
