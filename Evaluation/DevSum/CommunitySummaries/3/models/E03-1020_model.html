<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The algorithm is based on a graph model representing words and relationships between them . </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Sense clusters are iteratively computed by clustering the local graph of similar words around an ambiguous word . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This paper describes an algorithm which automatically discovers word senses from free text and maps them to the appropriate entries of existing dictionaries or taxonomies . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Based on the intuition that nouns which co-occur in a list are often semantically related , we extract contexts of the form Noun , Noun , ... Andros Noun , e.g . `` gnomic DNA from rat , mouse and dog '' . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Following the method in ( Widdows and Dorow , 2002 ) , we build a graph in which each node represents a noun and two nodes have an edge between them if they co-occur in lists more than a given number of times 1 . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To detect the different areas of meaning in our local graphs , we use a cluster algorithm for graphs ( Markov clustering , MCL ) developed by van Dongen ( 2000 ) . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The local graph in step 1 consists of w , the ni neighbors of w and the n9 neighbors of the neighbors of w. Since in each iteration we only attempt to find the `` best '' cluster , it suffices to build a relatively small graph in 1 . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We then determined the WordNet sunsets which most adequately characterized the sense clusters . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This gives rise to an automatic , unsupervised word sense disambiguation algorithm which is trained on the data to be disambiguated . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Preliminary observations show that the different neighbors in Table 1 can be used to indicate with great accuracy which of the senses is being used . </a></body>
