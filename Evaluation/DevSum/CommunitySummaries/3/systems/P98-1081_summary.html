<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A next step is to examine them in pairs . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>van Halteren ( ed . ) </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>van Halteren 1996 ) . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Compare this to the `` tune '' set in van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As we now apply the methods of van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) to WSJ as well , it is easier to make a comparison . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>After comparison, their outputs are combined using several voting strategies and second stage classifiers.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Traditionally , these models were categorized as either rule-based/symbolic or corpus-based/probabilistic . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In this paper , we are concerned with the question whether these differences between models can indeed be exploited to yield a data driven model with superior performance . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This is much easier and can quickly lead to a model which produces results with a reasonably good quality . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This can be explained by the fact that , in general , hand crafting an explicit model is rather difficult , especially since what is being modeled natural language , is not ( yet ) well- understood . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Data driven methods appear to be the more popular . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Our experiment shows that , at least for the task at hand , combination of several different systems allows us to raise the performance ceiling for data driven systems . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>After comparison , their outputs are combined using several voting strategies and second stage classifiers . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>When used on Test , the pairwise voting strategy ( TagPair ) clearly outperforms the other voting strategies , 8 but does not yet approach the level where all tying majority votes are handled correctly ( 98.31 % ) . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>It ought therefore to be advantageous to step away from the underlying mechanism of voting and to model the situations observed in Tune more closely . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Improving Data Driven Wordclass Tagging by System Combination</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The most important observation is that every combination ( significantly ) outperforms the combination of any strict subset of its components . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>the Maximum Entropy tagger ( 97.43 % ) . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>But the investigation need not be limited to word class tagging , for we expect that there are many other NLP tasks where combination could lead to worthwhile improvements . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>For our experiment , we divide the corpus into three parts . </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The first is the LOB corpus ( Johansson 1986 ) , which we used in the earlier experiments as well ( van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans 1998 ) and which has proved to be a good testing ground . </a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>In van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) we used a straightforward imÂ­ implementation of HMM 's , which turned out to have the worst accuracy of the four competing methods . </a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>5 The most straightforward selection method is an n-way vote . </a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The most important result that has undergone a change between van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) and our current experiments is the relative accuracy of TagPair and stacked systems such as MBL . </a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>With LOB and a single 114K tune set ( van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans 1998 ) , both MBL and Decision Trees degraded significantly when adding context , and MBL degraded when adding the word </a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>6In our experiment , a random selection from among the winning tags is made whenever there is a tie . </a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Other limiting factors are the power of the hard- and software used to implement the learning method and the availability of training material . </a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>A potential loophole is that each type of learning method brings its own inductive bias ' to the task and therefore different methods will tend to produce different errors . </a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Of all the four systems , this one has access to the most information : contextual information ( the words and tags in a window spanning three positions before and after the focus word ) as well as lexical information ( the existence of words formed by suffix ) . </a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>The Viterbi algorithm is used to determine the most probable tag sequence . </a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>For part-of-speech tagging , a significant increase in accuracy through combining the output of different taggers was first demonstrated in van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) and Brill and Wu ( 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Here we use a slight adaptation of the tagger . </a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>As far as we know this is also one of the first rigorous measurements of the relative quality of different tagger generators , using a single tagger and dataset and identical circumstances . </a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>Four well-known tagger generators (Hidden Markov Model, Memory-Based, Transformation Rules and Maximum Entropy) are trained on the same corpus data.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>tokens , but , because of a 92.5 % agreement over all four taggers , it yielded less than 9K tokens of useful training material to resolve disagreements . </a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>This was suspected to be the main reason for the relative lack of performance by the more sophisticated combiners . </a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>6 The question is how large a vote we allow each tagger . </a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>However , it is unlikely that we will be able to identify this 4This implies that it is impossible to note if errors counted against a tagger are in fact errors in the benchmark tagging . </a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>In both approaches , different tagger genÂ­ aerators were applied to the same training data and their predictions combined using different combination methods , including stacking . </a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Table 2 : Accuracy of individual taggers and combination methods . </a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>Simple Voting There are many ways in which the results of the component taggers can be combined , selecting a single tag from the set proposed by these taggers . </a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>the probability of each tag Tx given that the tagger suggested tag Ti . </a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>We can investigate all situations where one tagger suggests T1 and the other T2 and estimate the probability that in this situation the tag should actually be Tx . </a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>Where TagPair used to be significantly better than MBL , the roles are now well reversed . </a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>For this experiment we have selected four systems , primarily on the basis of availability . </a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>The corpus comprises about one million words , divided over 500 samples of 2000 words from 15 text types . </a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>The accuracy measurements for all of them are listed in Table 2 . </a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>For unknown word , the single positions before and after , three suffix letters , and information about capitalization and presence of a hyphen or a digit are used . </a></body>
