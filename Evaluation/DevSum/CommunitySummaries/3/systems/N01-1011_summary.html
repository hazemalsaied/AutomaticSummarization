<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In these experiments , there were no decision trees that used all of the digram features identify ed by the ? altering step , and for many words the decision tree learner went on to eliminate most of the candidate features . </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>There is no search of the feature space performed to build a representative model as is the case with decision trees . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A decision stump is a one node decision tree ( Holte , 1993 ) that is created by stopping the decision tree learner after the single most informative feature is added to the tree . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Rather than attempting to provide computer programs with real { world knowledge comparable to that of humans , natural language processing has turned to corpus { based methods . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Each sense { tagged occurrence of an ambiguous word is converted into a feature vector , where each feature represents some property of the surrounding text that is considered to be relevant to the disambiguation process . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Word sense disambiguation is the process of selecting the most appropriate meaning for a word , based on the context in which it occurs . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>These typically include the part { of { speech of surrounding words , the presence of certain key words within some window of context , and various syntactic properties of the sentence and the ambiguous word . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Then the decision tree learning algorithm is described , as are some benchmark learning algorithms that are included for purposes of comparison . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The following process is repeated for each task . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A preliminary version of this paper appears in ( Pedersen , 2001 ) . </a></body>
