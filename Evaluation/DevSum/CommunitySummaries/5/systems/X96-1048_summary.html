<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The latest in a series of natural language processing system evaluations was concluded in October 1995 and was the topic of the Sixth Message Understanding Conference ( MUC6 ) in November . </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The measures used for information extraction include two overall ones , the F-measure and error per response fill , and several other , more diagnostic ones ( recall , precision , under generation over generation and substitution ) . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>OVERVIEW OF RESULTS OF THE MUC-6 EVALUATION</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Even the simplest of the tasks , Named Entity , occasionally requires in-depth processing , e.g. , to determine whether `` 60 pounds '' is an expression of weight or of monetary value . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The Named Entity and Coreference tasks entailed Standard Generalized Markup Language ( SGML ) annotation of texts and were being conducted for the first time . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In the middle of the spectrum are definite descriptions and pronouns whose choice of referent is constrained by such factors as structural relations and discourse focus . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Most human errors pertained to definite descriptions and bare nominals , not to names and pronouns . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Participants were invited to enter their systems in as many as four different task-oriented evaluations . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The other two tasks , Template Element and Scenario Template , were information extraction tasks that followed on from the MUC evaluations conducted in previous years . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The evolution and design of the MUC6 evaluation are discussed in the paper by Grishman and Sundheim in this volume . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>COREFERENCE The task as defined for MUC6 was restricted to noun phrases ( NPs ) and was intended to be limited to phenomena that were relatively noncontroversial and easy to describe . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Note that nearly 80 % of the tags were ENAMEX and that almost half of those were categorization as organization names . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>ST Results on Some Aspects of Task and on `` Walkthrough Article '' Three succession events are reported in the walk through article . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Note also that even the best system on the third event was unable to determine that the succession event was occurring at McCannEfickson ; in addition , it only partially captured the full title of the post . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The SUCCESSION_EVENT object points down to the Ib~AND_OUT object , which in turn points down to PERSON Template Element objects that represent the persons involved in the succession event . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The management succession template consists of four object types , which are linked together via one-way pointers to form a hierarchical structure . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>All except the Scenario Template task are defined independently of any particular domain . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>It was also unexpected that one of the systems would match human performance on the task . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Common organization names , first names of people , and location names can be handled by recourse to list lookup , although there are drawbacks : some names may be on more than one list , the lists will not be complete and may not match the name as it is realized in the text ( e.g. , may not cover the needed abbreviated form of an organization name , may not cover the complete person name ) , etc.. </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>This paper surveys the results of the EVALUATION on each tasks and , to a more limited extent , across tasks . </a></body>
