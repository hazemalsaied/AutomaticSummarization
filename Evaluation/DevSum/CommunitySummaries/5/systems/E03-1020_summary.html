<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In contrast to pure Markov clustering , we do n't try to find a complete clustering of G into senses at once . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Sense clusters are iteratively computed by clustering the local graph of similar words around an ambiguous word.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>there are other related efforts on word sense discrimination ( Dorow and Widdows , 2003 ; Fukumoto and Suzuki , 1999 ; Pedersen and Bruce , 1997 ) . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>On the other hand , if the local graph is too big , we will get a lot of noise . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We then recompute the local graph Gw by discriminating against c 's features . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Then senses of target word were iteratively learned by clustering the local graph of similar words around target word . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This paper describes an algorithm which automatically discovers word senses from free text and maps them to the appropriate entries of existing dictionaries or taxonomies . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Automatic word sense discovery has applications of many kinds . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It can greatly facilitate a lexicographer 's work and can be used to automatically construct corpus-based taxonomies or to tune existing ones . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The same corpus evidence which supports a clustering of an ambiguous word into distinct senses can be used to decide which sense is referred to in a given context ( Schiitze , 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This paper is organized as follows . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In section 2 , we present the graph model from which we discover word senses . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Section 3 describes the way we divide graphs surrounding ambiguous words into different areas corresponding to different senses , using Markov clustering ( van Dongen , 2000 ) . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The quality of the Markov clustering depends strongly on several parameters such as a granularity factor and the size of the local graph . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In section 4 , we outline a word sense discovery algorithm which bypasses the problem of parameter tuning . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>We conducted a pilot experiment to examine the performance of our algorithm on a set of words with varying degree of ambiguity . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Section 5 describes the experiment and presents a sample of the results . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Finally , section 6 sketches applications of the algorithm and discusses future work . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The model from which we discover distinct Word senses is built automatically from the British National corpus , which is tagged for parts of speech . </a></body>
