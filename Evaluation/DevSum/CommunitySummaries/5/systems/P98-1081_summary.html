<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For part-of-speech tagging , a significant increase in accuracy through combining the output of different taggers was first demonstrated in van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) and Brill and Wu ( 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As we now apply the methods of van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) to WSJ as well , it is easier to make a comparison . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Compare this to the `` tune '' set in van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) we used a straightforward imÂ­ implementation of HMM 's , which turned out to have the worst accuracy of the four competing methods . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>With LOB and a single 114K tune set ( van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans 1998 ) , both MBL and Decision Trees degraded significantly when adding context , and MBL degraded when adding the word </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The most important result that has undergone a change between van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) and our current experiments is the relative accuracy of TagPair and stacked systems such as MBL . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The first is the LOB corpus ( Johansson 1986 ) , which we used in the earlier experiments as well ( van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans 1998 ) and which has proved to be a good testing ground . </a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>After comparison, their outputs are combined using several voting strategies and second stage classifiers.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>When used on Test , the pairwise voting strategy ( TagPair ) clearly outperforms the other voting strategies , 8 but does not yet approach the level where all tying majority votes are handled correctly ( 98.31 % ) . </a>

<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In both approaches , different tagger genÂ­ aerators were applied to the same training data and their predictions combined using different combination methods , including stacking . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Traditionally , these models were categorized as either rule-based/symbolic or corpus-based/probabilistic . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Recent work ( e.g . Brill 1992 ) has demonstrated clearly that this categorization is in fact a mix-up of two distinct Categorization systems : on the one hand there is the representation used for the language model ( rules , Markov model , neural net , case base , etc . ) and on the other hand the manner in which the model is constructed ( hand crafted vs. data driven ) . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Data driven methods appear to be the more popular . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>This can be explained by the fact that , in general , hand crafting an explicit model is rather difficult , especially since what is being modeled natural language , is not ( yet ) well- understood . </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>When a data driven method is used , a model is automatically learned from the implicit structure of an annotated training corpus . </a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>This is much easier and can quickly lead to a model which produces results with a reasonably good quality . </a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Obviously , reasonably good quality ' is not the ultimate goal . </a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Stacked classifiers From the measurements so far it appears that the use of more detailed information leads to a better accuracy improvement . </a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Unfortunately , the quality that can be reached for a given task is limited , and not merely by the potential of the learning method used . </a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Other limiting factors are the power of the hard- and software used to implement the learning method and the availability of training material . </a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Because of these limitations , we find that for most tasks we are ( at any point in time ) faced with a ceiling to the quality that can be reached with any ( then ) available machine learning system . </a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>However , the fact that any given system can not go beyond this ceiling does not mean that machine learning as a whole is similarly limited . </a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>To see whether this is in fact a good way to spend the extra data , we also trained the two best individual systems ( E and M , with exactly the same settings as in the first experiments ) on a concatenation of Train and Tune , so that they had access to every piece of data that the combination had seen . </a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>A potential loophole is that each type of learning method brings its own inductive bias ' to the task and therefore different methods will tend to produce different errors . </a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>The quality of the individual taggers cf . </a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>The relation between the accuracy of combinations ( using TagPair ) and that of the individual taggers is shown in Table 3 . </a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>It turns out that the increase in the individual taggers is quite limited when compared to combination . </a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>In this paper , we are concerned with the question whether these differences between models can indeed be exploited to yield a data driven model with superior performance . </a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>tokens , but , because of a 92.5 % agreement over all four taggers , it yielded less than 9K tokens of useful training material to resolve disagreements . </a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>1° Because C5.0 prunes the decision tree , the over fitting of training material ( Tune ) is less than with Memory-Based learning , but the results on Test are also worse . </a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>To examine if the overstraining effects are specific to this particular second level classifier , we also used the C5.0 system , a commercial version of the well-known program C4.5 ( Quinlan 1993 ) for the induction of decision trees , on the same training material . </a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>In the machine learning literature this approach is known as ensemble , stacked , or combined classifiers . </a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>Obviously there is still room for a closer examination of the differences between the combination methods , e.g . the question whether Memory-Based combination would have performed better if we had provided more training data than just Tune , and of the remaining errors , e.g . the effects of inconsistency in the data ( cf . </a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>The second part , Tune , consists of 10 % of the data ( every ninth utterance , 114479 tokens ) and is used to select the best tagger parameters where applicable and to develop the combination methods . </a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>As explained above , for combination to lead to improvement , the component taggers must differ in the errors that they make . </a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>When combining the taggers , every tagger pair is taken in turn and allowed to vote ( with the probability described above ) for each possible tag , i.e . not just the ones suggested by the component taggers . </a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>We can investigate all situations where one tagger suggests T1 and the other T2 and estimate the probability that in this situation the tag should actually be Tx . </a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>It has been shown that , when the errors are uncorrelated to a sufficient degree , the resulting combined classifier will often perform better than all the individual systems ( Ali and Pazzani 1996 ; Chan and Stolfo 1995 ; Tumer and Gosh 1996 ) . </a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>The underlying assumption is twofold . </a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>The data we use for our experiment consists of the tagged LOB corpus ( Johansson 1986 ) . </a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>First , the combined votes will make the system more robust to the quirks of each learner 's particular bias . </a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>Also , the use of information about each individual methods 's behavior in principle even admits the possibility to fix collective errors . </a></body>
