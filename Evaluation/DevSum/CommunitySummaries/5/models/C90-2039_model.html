<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The other , called tie strategic incremental copy graph unification method , uses an early failure finding strategy which first tries to unify : ; substructures tending to fail in unification ; this method is ; based on stochastic data on tim likelihood of failure and , educes unnecessary computation . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For example , a spoken Present . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Japanese analysis system based on llPSG [ Kogure 891 uses 90 % - 98 % of the elapsed time in FS unification . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>itowever , the problem with his method is that a unification result graph consists only of newly created structures . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This is unnecessary because there are often input subgraphs that can be used as part of the result graph without any modification , or as sharable parts between one of the input graphs and the result graph . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A better method would minimize the copying of sharable arts . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A better method would minimize the copying of sharable arts . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This paper proposes an FS unification method that allows structure sharing with constant moder node access time . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This method achieves structure sharing by introducing lazy copying to Wroblewski 's incremental copy graph unification method . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Then , the unification of tl anti t2 is defined as their greatest lower bound or the meet . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>5 disables structure sharing , ttowever , this whole copying is not necessary if a lazy evaluation method is used . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>With such a method , it is possible to delay copying a node until either its own contents need to change ( e.g. , node G3/Ka c ! 7 > ) or until it is found to have an arc ( sequence ) to a node t , hat needs to be copied ( e.g. , node X G3/ < a c > in Fig . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>in this method , theretbre , the failure tendency information is acquired by a learning process . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>That is , the SING unification method applied in an analysis system uses the failure tendency information acquired by a learning analysis process . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>in the learning process , when FS unification is applied , feature treatment orders are randomized for the sake of random extraction . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The LING unification method achieves structure sharing without the O ( log d ) data access overhead of Pereira 's method . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Furthermore , structure sharing increases the portion of token identical substructures of FSs which makes it efficient to keep unification results of substructures of FSs and reuse them . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>This reduces repeated calculation of substructures . </a></body>
