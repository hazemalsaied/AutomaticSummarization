This approach is similar in spirit to the iterative computational approaches of the Hidden Markov Models ( Kupiec , 1989 
The basic network can not model the dependency of the number of the verb on its subject , which precedes it by a prepositional phrase . 
This has the disadvantage that they can not share training data . 
The paper describes refinements that are currently being investigated in a model for part-of-speech assignment to words in unrestricted text.
The paper describes refinements that are currently being investigated in a model for part-of-speech assignment to words in unrestricted text . 
To model such dependency across the phrase , the networks shown in Figure 2 can be used . 
In the 21 category model reported in Kupiec ( 1989 ) only 129 equivalence classes were required to cover a 30,000 word dictionary . 
In this regard , word equivalence classes were used ( Kupiec , 1989 ) . 
It can be trained reliably on moderate amounts of training text , and through the use of selectively augmented networks it can model high-order dependencies without requiring an excessive number of parameters . 
This work was sponsored in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DOD ) , under the Information Science and Technology Office , contract # N0014086-C-8996 . 
In fact , the number of equivalence classes is essentially independent of the size of the dictionary , enabling new words to be added without any modification to the model . 
Methods have ranged from locally-operating rules ( Greene and Rubin , 1971 ) , to statistical methods ( Church , 1989 ; DeRose , 1988 ; Garside , Leech and Sampson , 1987 ; Jelinek , 1985 ) and back-propagation ( Benello , Mackie and Anderson , 1989 ; Nakamura and Shikano , 1989 ) .
