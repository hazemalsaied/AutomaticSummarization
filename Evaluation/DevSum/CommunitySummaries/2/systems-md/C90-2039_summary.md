A unification example is shown in Fig . 
Japanese analysis system based on llPSG [ Kogure 891 uses 90 % - 98 % of the elapsed time in FS unification . 
Other versions based on more efficient graph unification methods such as Wroblewski 's and Kogure 's method [ 23 , 16 ] have also been developed . 
Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification
This order is related to the unification failure tendency . 
Various kinds of grammatical formalisms without t , transformation were proposed from the late 1970s I ; rough the 1980s l ( ] aider al 85 , l ( plan and Bresnan 82 , Kay 1~5 , Pollm 'd and Sag 871 . 
These formalisms were applied in the field of natural language processing and , based on these formalisms , ~ : systems such as machine translation systems were developed [ l < ol ; u , e et a l 8gJ . 
Kowalewski claims that copying is wrong when an algorithm copies too much ( over copying ) or copies too soon ( early copying ) . 
That is , unless some new scheme for reducing excessive copying is introduced such as scucture-sharing of an unchanged shared-forest ( [ Kogure , 1990 ] ) . 
The strategic lazy incremental copy graph ( SLING ) unification method combines two incremental copy graph unification methods : the lazy incremental copy graph ( LING ) unification method and the strategic incremental copy graph ( SING ) unification method . 
This causes O ( log d ) graph node access time overhead in assembling the whole DG from the skeleton and environments where d is the number of nodes in the DG . 
These unification failure tendencies depend on systems such as analysis systems or generation systems . 
Previous research identified DG copying as a significant overhead . 
however the problem with his method is that a unification result graph consists only of newly created structures . 
One , called the lazy incremental copy graph unification method , achieves structure sharing with constant order data access time which reduces the required memory . 
Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying . 
It substitutes arcs with newly copied nodes for existing arcs . 
ELSE AddArc ( out node shareholder arc node . 
node 2 Dereferencelnode2 ) . 
AddArc ( out node complementary new node . 
For example , the node Y ( G3/ < o c g > ) will be modified to be the Unification result of G 1/ < a c g > ( or G1/ < b d > ) and G2/ < b d > when the feature paths < b d > will be treated .
