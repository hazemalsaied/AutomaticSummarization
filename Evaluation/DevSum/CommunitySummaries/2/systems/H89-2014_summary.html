<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This approach is similar in spirit to the iterative computational approaches of the Hidden Markov Models ( Kupiec , 1989 </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The basic network can not model the dependency of the number of the verb on its subject , which precedes it by a prepositional phrase . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This has the disadvantage that they can not share training data . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The paper describes refinements that are currently being investigated in a model for part-of-speech assignment to words in unrestricted text.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To model such dependency across the phrase , the networks shown in Figure 2 can be used . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In the 21 category model reported in Kupiec ( 1989 ) only 129 equivalence classes were required to cover a 30,000 word dictionary . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this regard , word equivalence classes were used ( Kupiec , 1989 ) . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It can be trained reliably on moderate amounts of training text , and through the use of selectively augmented networks it can model high-order dependencies without requiring an excessive number of parameters . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This work was sponsored in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DOD ) , under the Information Science and Technology Office , contract # N0014086-C-8996 . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In fact , the number of equivalence classes is essentially independent of the size of the dictionary , enabling new words to be added without any modification to the model . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Methods have ranged from locally-operating rules ( Greene and Rubin , 1971 ) , to statistical methods ( Church , 1989 ; DeRose , 1988 ; Garside , Leech and Sampson , 1987 ; Jelinek , 1985 ) and back-propagation ( Benello , Mackie and Anderson , 1989 ; Nakamura and Shikano , 1989 ) . </a></body>
