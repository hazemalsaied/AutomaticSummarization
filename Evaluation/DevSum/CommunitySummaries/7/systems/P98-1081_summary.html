<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The first and oldest system uses a traditional trig-ram model ( Steetskamp 1995 ; henceforth tagger T , for Trigrams ) , based on context statistics P ( ti [ ti-l , ti-2 ) and lexical statistics P ( Tildi directly estimated from relative corpus frequencies . </a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Four well-known tagger generators (Hidden Markov Model, Memory-Based, Transformation Rules and Maximum Entropy) are trained on the same corpus data.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Also of note is the improvement yielded by the best combination . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>But the investigation need not be limited to word class tagging , for we expect that there are many other NLP tasks where combination could lead to worthwhile improvements . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>After comparison, their outputs are combined using several voting strategies and second stage classifiers.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In all Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) systems , we find one or more language models which are used to predict , classify Andros interpret language related observations . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Traditionally , these models were categorized as either rule-based/symbolic or corpus-based/probabilistic . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Recent work ( e.g . Brill 1992 ) has demonstrated clearly that this categorization is in fact a mix-up of two distinct Categorization systems : on the one hand there is the representation used for the language model ( rules , Markov model , neural net , case base , etc . ) and on the other hand the manner in which the model is constructed ( hand crafted vs. data driven ) . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Data driven methods appear to be the more popular . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This can be explained by the fact that , in general , hand crafting an explicit model is rather difficult , especially since what is being modeled natural language , is not ( yet ) well- understood . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>After comparison , their outputs are combined using several voting strategies and second stage classifiers . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>When used on Test , the pairwise voting strategy ( TagPair ) clearly outperforms the other voting strategies , 8 but does not yet approach the level where all tying majority votes are handled correctly ( 98.31 % ) . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>It ought therefore to be advantageous to step away from the underlying mechanism of voting and to model the situations observed in Tune more closely . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In this paper , we are concerned with the question whether these differences between models can indeed be exploited to yield a data driven model with superior performance . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Since this model has no facilities for handling unknown words , a Memory-Based system ( see below ) is used to propose distributions of potential tags for words not in the lexicon . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>This is much easier and can quickly lead to a model which produces results with a reasonably good quality . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The corpus comprises about one million words , divided over 500 samples of 2000 words from 15 text types . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>As it turns out all voting systems outperform the best single tagger , E. 7 Also , the best voting system is the one in which the most specific information is used , Precision-Recall . </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The system used here has access to information about the focus word and the two positions before and after , at least for known words . </a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>5 The most straightforward selection method is an n-way vote . </a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>It uses a number of word and context features rather similar to system M , and trains a Maximum Entropy model that assigns a weighting parameter to each feature-value and combination of features that is relevant to the estimation of the probability P ( tag [ features ) . </a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>When combining the taggers , every tagger pair is taken in turn and allowed to vote ( with the probability described above ) for each possible tag , i.e . not just the ones suggested by the component taggers . </a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Of all the four systems , this one has access to the most information : contextual information ( the words and tags in a window spanning three positions before and after the focus word ) as well as lexical information ( the existence of words formed by suffix ) . </a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Each tagger is allowed to vote for the tag of its choice and the tag with the highest number of votes is selected . </a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Pairwise Voting So far , we have only used information on the performance of individual taggers . </a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>As we now apply the methods of van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) to WSJ as well , it is easier to make a comparison . </a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>When a data driven method is used , a model is automatically learned from the implicit structure of an annotated training corpus . </a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Other limiting factors are the power of the hard- and software used to implement the learning method and the availability of training material . </a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>The most important observation is that every combination ( significantly ) outperforms the combination of any strict subset of its components . </a>

<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>The pairwise voting system , using all four individual taggers , scores 97.92 % correct on Test , a 19.1 % reduction in error rate over the best individual system , viz . </a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>Obviously , reasonably good quality ' is not the ultimate goal . </a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>The accuracy measurements for all of them are listed in Table 2 . </a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>After that , the decisive factor appears to be the difference in language model : T is generally a better combiner than M and R , 12 even though it has the lowest accuracy when operating alone . </a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>9 The explanation for this can be found when we examine the differences within the Memory- Based general strategy : the more feature information is stored , the higher the accuracy on Tune , but the lower the accuracy on Test . </a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>6 The question is how large a vote we allow each tagger . </a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Unfortunately , the quality that can be reached for a given task is limited , and not merely by the potential of the learning method used . </a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>Obviously there is still room for a closer examination of the differences between the combination methods , e.g . the question whether Memory-Based combination would have performed better if we had provided more training data than just Tune , and of the remaining errors , e.g . the effects of inconsistency in the data ( cf . </a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>As explained above , for combination to lead to improvement , the component taggers must differ in the errors that they make . </a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>Component taggers In 1992 , van Halteren combined a number of taggers by way of a straightforward majority vote ( cf . </a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>Its tagging , which was manually checked and corrected , is generally accepted to be quite accurate . </a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>nation scheme is the fact that for the most successful combination schemes , one has to reserve a nontrivial portion ( in the experiment 10 % of the total material ) of the annotated data to set the parameters for the combination . </a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>First of all , tagging is a widely researched and well-understood task ( cf . </a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>The NLP task used in the experiment is morpho-syntactic word class tagging . </a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>Because of these limitations , we find that for most tasks we are ( at any point in time ) faced with a ceiling to the quality that can be reached with any ( then ) available machine learning system . </a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49>However , the fact that any given system can not go beyond this ceiling does not mean that machine learning as a whole is similarly limited . </a>
<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50>A potential loophole is that each type of learning method brings its own inductive bias ' to the task and therefore different methods will tend to produce different errors . </a>
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51>In the machine learning literature this approach is known as ensemble , stacked , or combined classifiers . </a>
<a name="52">[52]</a> <a href="#52" id=52>It has been shown that , when the errors are uncorrelated to a sufficient degree , the resulting combined classifier will often perform better than all the individual systems ( Ali and Pazzani 1996 ; Chan and Stolfo 1995 ; Tumer and Gosh 1996 ) . </a>
<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53>The underlying assumption is twofold . </a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54>The most democratic option is to give each tagger one vote ( Majority ) . </a>
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55>Stacked classifiers From the measurements so far it appears that the use of more detailed information leads to a better accuracy improvement . </a>
<a name="56">[56]</a> <a href="#56" id=56>In van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) we used a straightforward imÂ­ implementation of HMM 's , which turned out to have the worst accuracy of the four competing methods . </a>
<a name="57">[57]</a> <a href="#57" id=57>First , the combined votes will make the system more robust to the quirks of each learner 's particular bias . </a>
<a name="58">[58]</a> <a href="#58" id=58>Also , the use of information about each individual method 's behavior in principle even admits the possibility to fix collective errors . </a>
<a name="59">[59]</a> <a href="#59" id=59>We will execute our investigation by means of an experiment . </a>
<a name="60">[60]</a> <a href="#60" id=60>The reasons for this choice are several . </a>
<a name="61">[61]</a> <a href="#61" id=61>the probability of each tag Tx given that the tagger suggested tag Ti . </a>
<a name="62">[62]</a> <a href="#62" id=62>In the basic version ( Tags ) , each case consists of the tags suggested by the component taggers and the correct tag . </a>
<a name="63">[63]</a> <a href="#63" id=63>Finally , a number of rather different methods are available that generate a fully functional tagging system from annotated text . </a>

<a name="66">[66]</a> <a href="#66" id=66>Second , current performance levels on this task still leave room for improvement : state of the art ' performance for data driven automatic word class taggers ( tagging English text with single tags from a low detail tagger is 9697 % correctly tagged words . </a>
<a name="67">[67]</a> <a href="#67" id=67>The patterns between the brackets give the distribution of incorrect tags over the systems . </a>
<a name="68">[68]</a> <a href="#68" id=68>Both this system and Brill 's system are used with the default settings that are suggested in their documentation . </a>
<a name="69">[69]</a> <a href="#69" id=69>During the training phase , cases containing information about the word , the context and the correct tag are stored in memory . </a>
<a name="70">[70]</a> <a href="#70" id=70>The data in Train ( for individual taggers and Tune ( for combination taggers is to be the only information used in tagger construction : all components of all taggers lexicon , context statistics , etc . ) are to be entirely data driven and no manual adjustments are to be done . </a>
<a name="71">[71]</a> <a href="#71" id=71>However , it is unlikely that we will be able to identify this 4This implies that it is impossible to note if errors counted against a tagger are in fact errors in the benchmark tagging . </a>
<a name="72">[72]</a> <a href="#72" id=72>For part-of-speech tagging , a significant increase in accuracy through combining the output of different taggers was first demonstrated in van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) and Brill and Wu ( 1998 ) . </a>

<a name="74">[74]</a> <a href="#74" id=74>It turns out that the increase in the individual taggers is quite limited when compared to combination . </a>

<a name="77">[77]</a> <a href="#77" id=77>Regardless of such closer investigation , we feel that our results are encouraging enough to extend our investigation of combination , starting with additional component taggers and selection strategies , and going on to shifts to other taggers languages . </a>
<a name="78">[78]</a> <a href="#78" id=78>As far as we know this is also one of the first rigorous measurements of the relative quality of different tagger generators , using a single tagger and dataset and identical circumstances . </a>
<a name="79">[79]</a> <a href="#79" id=79>In order to see whether combination of the component taggers is likely to lead to improvements of tagging quality , we first examine the results of the individual taggers when applied to Tune . </a>

<a name="86">[86]</a> <a href="#86" id=86>Since the component taggers all used n-gram statistics to model context probabilities and the knowledge representation was hence fundamentally the same in each component , the results were limited . </a>
<a name="87">[87]</a> <a href="#87" id=87>Now there are more varied systems available , a variety which we hope will lead to better combination effects . </a>

<a name="89">[89]</a> <a href="#89" id=89>The second part , Tune , consists of 10 % of the data ( every ninth utterance , 114479 tokens ) and is used to select the best tagger parameters where applicable and to develop the combination methods . </a>
<a name="90">[90]</a> <a href="#90" id=90>The third and final part , Test , consists of the remaining 10 % ( .115101 tokens ) and is used for the final performance measurements of all taggers . </a>
<a name="91">[91]</a> <a href="#91" id=91>Both Tune and Test contain around 2.5 % new tokens ( wrt Train ) and a further 0.2 % known tokens with new tags . </a>
<a name="92">[92]</a> <a href="#92" id=92>However , it appears more useful to give more weight to taggers which have proved their quality . </a>
<a name="93">[93]</a> <a href="#93" id=93>But we have even more information on how well the taggers perform . </a>
<a name="94">[94]</a> <a href="#94" id=94>1° Because C5.0 prunes the decision tree , the over fitting of training material ( Tune ) is less than with Memory-Based learning , but the results on Test are also worse . </a>
<a name="95">[95]</a> <a href="#95" id=95>Compare this to the `` tune '' set in van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="96">[96]</a> <a href="#96" id=96>This is most likely an overstraining effect : Tune is probably too small to collect case bases which can leverage the stacking effect convincingly , especially since only 7.51 % of the second stage material shows disagreement between the featured tags . </a>

<a name="98">[98]</a> <a href="#98" id=98>We can investigate all situations where one tagger suggests T1 and the other T2 and estimate the probability that in this situation the tag should actually be Tx . </a>
<a name="99">[99]</a> <a href="#99" id=99>Note that with this method ( and those in the next section ) a tag suggested by a minority ( or even none ) of the taggers still has a chance to win . </a>
<a name="100">[100]</a> <a href="#100" id=100>The most important result that has undergone a change between van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans ( 1998 ) and our current experiments is the relative accuracy of TagPair and stacked systems such as MBL . </a>
<a name="101">[101]</a> <a href="#101" id=101>A major factor in the quality of the combination results is obviously the quality of the best component : all combinations with E score higher than those without E ( although M , R and T together are able to beat E alone 1 1 . </a>

<a name="129">[129]</a> <a href="#129" id=129>In this paper we examine how the differences in modeling between different data driven systems performing the same NLP task can be exploited to yield a higher accuracy than the best individual system . </a>
<a name="130">[130]</a> <a href="#130" id=130>When abstracting away from individual tags , precision and recall are equal and measure how many tokens are tagged correctly ; in this case we also use the more generic term accuracy . </a>
<a name="131">[131]</a> <a href="#131" id=131>With LOB and a single 114K tune set ( van Halteren , Zavrel , and Daelemans 1998 ) , both MBL and Decision Trees degraded significantly when adding context , and MBL degraded when adding the word </a>
<a name="132">[132]</a> <a href="#132" id=132>For unknown words , the single position before and after , three suffix letters , and information about capitalization and presence of a hyphen or a digit are used . </a>
<a name="133">[133]</a> <a href="#133" id=133>The information about each tagger 's quality is derived from an inspection of its results on Tune . </a>
<a name="134">[134]</a> <a href="#134" id=134>To see whether this is in fact a good ways to spend the extra data , we also trained the two best individual systems ( E and M , with exactly the same settings as in the first experiments ) on a concatenation of trains and Tune , so that they had access to every piece of data that the Combination had seen . </a></body>
