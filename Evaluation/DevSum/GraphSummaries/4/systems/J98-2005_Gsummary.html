In terms of the frequency function f , introduced in Section 1 , the likelihood of the data is L = L ( p ; cal , ca2 ... .. con ) n = II II p ( AY i=1 ( A~ ) ER Recall the derivation of the maximum-likelihood estimator of p : The log of the likelihood is : n ~ ~f ( A -- + a ; cai ) log A ~ a ) . </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Dumpster Laird , and Rubin [ 1977 ] put the idea into a much more general setting and coined the Chi and Geman Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars term EM for Expectation-Maximization . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>More generally , ~ will refer to the probability distribution on ( possibly infinite ) parse trees induced by the maximum-likelihood estimator . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This iteration procedure is an instance of the EM Algorithm . </a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Based upon the results of Stolcke [ 1995 ] it is likely that this restriction can be relaxed , but we have not pursued this . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>( Wetherell and others use the designation `` consistent '' instead of `` tight , '' but in statistics , consistency refers to the asymptotic correctness of an estimator . ) </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If the corpus is unparsed then there is an iterative approach to maximum-likelihood estimation ( the EM or Baum-Welsh algorithm -- again , see Section 2 ) and the same question arises : do we get actual probabilities or do the estimated PCFG 's assign some mass to infinite trees ? </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Given a set of finite parse trees wl , w2 ... .. w , , the maximum-likelihood estimator for p ( see Section 2 ) is , sensibly enough , the `` relative frequency '' estimator y'~nlf A ~ AA ; wi ) ~i=1 f ( A ~ AA ; wi ) + f ( A ~ a ; wi ) ] where f ( . ; w ) is the number of occurrences of the production `` . '' in the tree w. The sentence a m , although ambiguous ( there are multiple parses when m > 2 ) , always involves m - 1 of the A ~ AA productions and m of the A ~ a productions . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Furthermore , CFG 's are readily fit with a probability distribution ( to make probabilistic CFG 's -- or PCFG 's ) , rendering them suitable for ambiguous languages through the maximum a posteriori rule of choosing the most probable parse . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Letting ~y denote { w Efk Y ( w ) = Y } , the likelihood of the corpus becomes n H E H P ( A -- '~oL ) f ( A~ ; ~ ) '' i=1 ~OE~y ( ~i ) ( A -- -~o~ ) ER And the maximum-likelihood equation becomes + p ( B fl ) Ei=l EwEfly ( wi , I-I ( A -- . ) cR p ( A -~ a ) f ( A-~ '' ; ~ ) = 0 fT ( B ~ /3 ) = ~iL1 Ep~f ( B ~ fl ; w ) lw E ~y ( ~ , ) ] ( 4 ) , ~s , , , ~Ei=IEpV ( `` a ; w ) lw E ~Y ( o~ , ) ] E ( B_~ , E B ~ where E~ is expectation under fi and where `` ] w E~-~y ( wi ) '' means `` conditioned on 0.2E ~-~Y ( wi ) ' '' There is no hope for a closed form solution , but ( 4 ) does suggest an iteration scheme , which , as it turns out , `` climbs '' the likelihood surface ( though there are no guarantees about approaching a global maximum ) : Let P0 be an arbitrary assignment respecting ( 1 ) . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>More generally , let G -- ( V , T , R , S ) denote a context-free grammar with finite variable set V , start symbol S E V , finite terminal set T , and finite production ( or rule ) set R . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We will show that qs = 0 ( i.e. , derivation trees rooted with S always terminate ) . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Furthermore , F ( A ; w ) and F ( A ; ~ ) satisfy the same conditions as before : I : ( A ; w ) = F ( A ; w ) except when A = S , in which case F ( A ; w ) < F ( A ; w ) . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>For example , there is a simple maximum-likelihood prescription for estimating the production probabilities from a corpus of trees ( see Section 2 ) , resulting in a PCFG . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>For each nonterminal symbol , a ( normalized ) probability is placed on the set of all productions from that symbol . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Assign probability p to the first production ( A ~ AA ) and q = 1 -p to the second ( A ~ a ) . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>It is reasonable to hope that if the trees in the sample are finite , then an estimate of production probabilities based upon the sample will produce a system that assigns probability zero to the set of infinite trees . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Proof Almost identical , except that we use ( 5 ) in place of ( 3 ) and end up with : n E qA EEG_1 [ F ( A ; wi ) -F ( A ; wi ) lw C fly ( w , ) ] ~ 0 . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>It is not hard to show that Sh is nondecreasing and converges to min ( 1 , I ) , meaning that a proper probability is obtained if and only if p < ~ . </a>

<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>In the simple example here , the estimator converges in one step and is the same ~ as if we had observed the entire parse tree for each wi . </a>
