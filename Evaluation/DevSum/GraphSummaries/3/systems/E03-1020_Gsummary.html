<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Based on the intuition that nouns which co-occur in a list are often semantically related , we extract contexts of the form Noun , Noun , ... Andros Noun , e.g . `` gnomic DNA from rat , mouse and dog '' . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In our simple model based on noun co-occurrences in lists , step 5 corresponds to rebuilding the graph under the restriction that the nodes in the new graph not co-occur ( or at least not very often ) with any of the cluster members already extracted . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In contrast to pure Markov clustering , we do n't try to find a complete clustering of G into senses at once . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To detect the different areas of meaning in our local graphs , we use a cluster algorithm for graphs ( Markov clustering , MCL ) developed by van Dongen ( 2000 ) . </a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If the local graph handed over to the MCL process is small , we might miss some of w 's meanings in the corpus . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The family of such algorithms is described in ( Widdows , 2003 ) . </a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>An appropriate choice of the inflation para 80 meter r can depend on the ambiguous word w to be clustered . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Usually , one sense of an ambiguous word w is much more frequent than its other senses present in the corpus . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The same corpus evidence which supports a clustering of an ambiguous word into distinct senses can be used to decide which sense is referred to in a given context ( Schiitze , 1998 ) . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>However , there are ambiguous words with more closely related senses which are metaphorical or metonymy variations of one another . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Therefore , even after removal of the wing-node , the two areas of meaning are still linked via tail . </a>

The adjacency matrix MG 4111 ) 11 41 4Wit ler,1110.1/.17 cgtoserek¦Ilt Figure 2 : Local graph of the word wing of a graph G , is defined by setting ( 111G ) pq equal to the weight of the edge between nodes v and v q . Normalizing the columns of A/G results in the Markov Matrix Taw whose entries ( Thi , ) pq can be interpreted as transition probability from v q to vv . It can easily be shown that the k-th power of TG lists the probabilities ( TL ) pq of a path of length k starting at node vq and ending at node V. The MCL-algorithm simulates flow in Gw by iteratively recomputing the set of transition probabilities via two steps , expansion and inflation . </a>

<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>This is achieved , in a manner similar to Pantel and Lin 's ( 2002 ) sense clustering approach , by removing c 's features from the set of features used for finding similar words . </a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>1 Si ample cutoff functions proved unsatisfactory because of the bias they give to more frequent words . </a>

<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Section 3 describes the way we divide graphs surrounding ambiguous words into different areas corresponding to different senses , using Markov clustering ( van Dongen , 2000 ) . </a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Ambiguous words link otherwise unrelated areas of meaning E.g . rat and printer are very different in meaning , but they are both closely related to different meanings of mouse . </a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Following Lin 's work ( 1998 ) , we are currently investigating a graph with verb-object , verb-subject and modifier-noun-collocations from which it is possible to infer more about the senses of systematically polygamous Word . </a></body>
