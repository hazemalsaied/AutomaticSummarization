<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Our experiment shows that , at least for the task at hand , combination of several different systems allows us to raise the performance ceiling for data driven systems . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>To see whether this is in fact a good way to spend the extra data , we also trained the two best individual systems ( E and M , with exactly the same settings as in the first experiments ) on a concatenation of Train and Tune , so that they had access to every piece of data that the combination had seen . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The practice of feeding the outputs of a number of classifiers as features for a next learner sit is significantly better than the runner-up ( Precision-Recall ) with p=0 . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The Viterbi algorithm is used to determine the most probable tag sequence . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>During the training phase , cases containing information about the word , the context and the correct tag are stored in memory . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>In the more advanced versions we also add information about the word in question ( Tags+Word ) and the tags suggested by all taggers for the previous and the next position ( Tags+Context ) . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Both Tune and Test contain around 2.5 % new tokens ( wrt Train ) and a further 0.2 % known tokens with new tags . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Unfortunately , the quality that can be reached for a given task is limited , and not merely by the potential of the learning method used . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>We can investigate all situations where one tagger suggests T1 and the other T2 and estimate the probability that in this situation the tag should actually be Tx . </a>
