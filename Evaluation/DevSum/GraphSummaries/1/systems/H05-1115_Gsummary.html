<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given this observation , we experimented with two mixed strategies , in which the number of content words in a question determined whether LexRank or the baseline system was used for sentence retrieval . </a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since we are interested in a passage retrieval mechanism that sentences relevant to a given question , providing input to the question answering component of our system , the improvement in average TRDR score is very promising . </a>
