<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The quality of the Markov clustering depends strongly on several parameters such as a granularity factor and the size of the local graph . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We then determined the WordNet sunsets which most adequately characterized the sense clusters . </a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The algorithm consists of the following steps : 1 . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Usually , one sense of an ambiguous word w is much more frequent than its other senses present in the corpus . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In section 2 , we present the graph model from which we discover word senses . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>However , whereas there are many edges within an area of meaning , there is only a small number of ( weak ) links between different areas of meaning . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Automatic word sense discovery has applications of many kinds . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Preliminary observations show that the different neighbors in Table 1 can be used to indicate with great accuracy which of the senses is being used . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Our algorithm was applied to each word in the list ( with parameters Iii = 20 , n2 = 10 , r = 2.0 , k = 2.0 ) in order to extract the top two sense clusters only . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The family of such algorithms is described in ( Widdows , 2003 ) . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Following the method in ( Widdows and Dorow , 2002 ) , we build a graph in which each node represents a noun and two nodes have an edge between them if they co-occur in lists more than a given number of times 1 . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The expansion steps corresponds with taking the k-th power of TGÂ„ as outlined above and allows node to see new neighbors . </a></body>
