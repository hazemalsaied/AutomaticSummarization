<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In our simple model based on noun co-occurrences in lists , step 5 corresponds to rebuilding the graph under the restriction that the nodes in the new graph not co-occur ( or at least not very often ) with any of the cluster members already extracted . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The process is stopped if the similarity between w and its best neighbor under the reduced set of features is below a fixed threshold . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Section 3 describes the way we divide graphs surrounding ambiguous words into different areas corresponding to different senses , using Markov clustering ( van Dongen , 2000 ) . </a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Following Lin 's work ( 1998 ) , we are currently investigating a graph with verb-object , verb-subject and modifier-noun-collocations from which it is possible to infer more about the senses of systematically polygamous words . </a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>However , if we remove the mouse-node from its local graph illustrated in figure 1 , the graph decomposes into two parts , one representing the electronic device meaning of mouse and the other one representing its animal sense . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In section 2 , we present the graph model from which we discover word senses . </a>
