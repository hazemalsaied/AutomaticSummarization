Let type resolution be the total function R : - > DRFS such that R ( F ) is the set of all resolved of F. Guided by the partition and all-or-nothing conditions , King [ 13 ] has formulated a semantics of feature structures and developed a notion of a satisfiable feature structure such that F E FS is satisfiable iff R ( F ) 0 . 
It would , of course , not be very efficient to work with such large disjunctions of feature structures . 
THE CORRECT AND EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION OF APPROPRIATENESS SPECIFICATIONS FOR TYPED FEATURE STRUCTURES
1 Unlike previous systems such as ALl , : , Troll does not employ any type inferencing inste~M , a , limited amount of named disjunction ( [ 1 1 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 6 ] ) is introduced to record type resolved u son possibilities . 
APPROPRIATENES S CONDITIONS A very important property of the class of DRFS is that they are closed under unification , i.e. , if F and F'E DRFS then F U F ' E DRFS.4 Given this property , it would in principle he possible to use the disjunctive resolved feature structures in an implementation without any additional type inferencing procedure to maintain satisfiability . 
C , legerdemain % King [ 8 ] have also shown that a feature structure l ] lets all encoded FCRs ifl '' the feature structure is satisfiable . 
By contrast , the Troll system described in this paper has an effective algorithm f < > r deciding well-formedness , which is based on the idea of efficiently representing disjunctive possibilities within the feature structure , Call a well-typed feature structure in which all nodes are labeled with species a resolved feature structure and call a set of resolved feature structures that have the same underlying graph ( that is , they differ only in their node labellings ) a disjunctive resolved feature structure . 
We write fS , ~vf8 and 'D~ . ) c $ for the collections of feature structures , resolved feature structures and disjunctive resolved feature structures respectively . 
Say that F'E RFS is a resolved of F E FS iff F and F ' have the same underlying graph and F subsumes F ' . 
well-typable iff the feature structure subsumes a well-typed feature structure , in ALl . : , type inferencing is employed to ensure that all feature structures are well-typable -- in fact , all feature structures are well typed . 
Consider again the encoding of p and the feature structure 9~ . 
Consider , For exam- pie , our encoding of the disjunctive FCR p and suppose that 99 is the fe , feature structure t [ f : +,9 : - ] .

For example , there are no verbs which have the [ mixture . The simplest way to express such restrictions is by means of a.n appropriateness function : Type ร Feat ~ Type . 
Unification of sets of feature structures is defined here ill the standard way : S t2 , S '' = { 1 '' [ I '' ' 6 S and l '' '' G S '' and 1 '' = 1 '' ' H 1 '' '' } . 
Loosely speaking , the appropriateness sl ) specifications for type t encode the part of p that sta , tes that an object of tyl ) e t deserves features f and g , both with boolean vales . 
A m~L , ior reason for adding types to ~ form ism is to express restrictions on feature a.s in ( ; l 's ( : : [ 5 ] in order to rule out nonexistent ) es of objects .
