NAMED ENTITY The Named Entity ( NE ) task requires insertion of SGML tags into the text stream . 
The other two tasks , Template Element and Scenario Template , were information extraction tasks that followed on from the MUC evaluations conducted in previous years . 
The identification of a name as that of an organization ( hence , instantiation of an ORGANIZATION object ) or as a person ( PERSON object ) is a named entity identification task . 
It appears that there is a wide variety of sources of error that impose limits on system effectiveness , whatever the techniques employed by the system . 
The mix of challenges that the Scenario Template task represents has been shown to yield levels of performance that are similar to those achieved in previous MUCs , but this time with a much shorter time required for porting . 
For MUC6 , text filtering scores were as high as 98 % recall ( with precision in the 80th percentile ) or 96 % precision ( with recall in the 80th percentile ) . 
Two useful attributes for the equivalence class as a whole would be one to distinguish individual co reference from type co reference and one to identify the general semantic type of the class ( organization , person , location , time , currency , etc . ) . 
The percentage of personal pronouns is relatively high ( 38 % ) , compared to the test set overall ( 24 % ) , as is the percentage of proper names ( 40 % on this text versus an estimate of 30 % overall ) . 
Much less information about the event would be captured , but there would be a much stronger focus on the most essential information elements . 
The highest ST F-measure score was 56.40 ( 47 % recall , 70 % precision ) . 
Mis categorization of Entity as person ( PER_NAME or PER_ALIAS ) instead of organization ( ORG_NAME or ORG_ALIAS ) .
