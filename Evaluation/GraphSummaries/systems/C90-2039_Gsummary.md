Japanese analysis system based on llPSG [ Kogure 891 uses 90 % - 98 % of the elapsed time in FS unification . 
To achieve this , I , he LING unification method , which uses copy dependency information , was developed . 
These formalisms were applied in the field of natural language processing and , based on these formalisms , ~ : systems such as machine translation systems were developed [ l < ol ; u , e et a l 8gJ . 
Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification
The section also introduces the key idea of the EFF strategy wolfish comes from observations of his method . 
in the learning process , when FS unification is applied , feature treatment orders are randomized for the sake of random extraction . 
This method achieves structure sharing by introducing lazy copying to Wroblewski 's incremental copy graph unification method . 
Ile proposed an incremental copy graph unification method to avoid over copying and early copying . 
Complex FSs can have complex FSs as their feature values and can share certain values among features . 
The data in the COPY-DEPENDENCY slot are I ; temporary and they are discarded during an extensive process such as analyzing a sentence , however this does not result in any incompleteness or in any partial analysis structure being test . 
The revised procedure uses a newly introduced slot COPY-DEPENDENCY . 
Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying . 
Several FS unification methods were proposed in IKarttunen 86 , Ferreira 85 , Wroblewski 871 . 
Previous research identified DG copying as a significant overhead . 
Ferreira structure sharing FS unification method can avoid this problem . 
In such unification-based formalisms , feature structures FS ) Unification is the most fundamental and significant operation .
