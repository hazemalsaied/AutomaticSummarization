In addition , the input to our system isa set of documents relevant to the topic of the query the user has already identified ( e.g . via a search engine . 
In ( Erkan and Radev , 2004 ) , we introduce method and successfully applied it generic multi-document summarization . 
and sentence numbers of the top 20 sentences . 
While evaluations of question answering systems are often based on a shorter list of ranked sentences we chose to generate longer lists for several reasons . 
In the new approach , the 916 score of a sentence is determined by a mixture model of the relevance of the sentence to the query and the similarity of the sentence to other high-scoring sentences . 
3.3 The mixture model . 
Recent work has motivated the need for systems that support Information Synthesis tasks , in which user seeks a global understanding of a topic story Amigo et al. , 2004 ) . 
As previously mentioned , the original LexRank method performed welling the context of generic summarization . 
We presented topic-sensitive LexRank and applied it to the problem of sentence retrieval . 
While the last two sentences do not provide answers according to our judges , they do provide context information about the situation . 
As discussed in Section 2 , our goal wast develop a topic-sensitive version of LexRank and to use it to improve a baseline systems , which previously been used successfully for query-basedsentence Retrieval ( Allan et al . , 2003 ) .
