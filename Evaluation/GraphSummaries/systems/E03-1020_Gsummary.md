This approach to disambiguation combines the benefits of both Yarowsky 's ( 1995 ) and Schtitze 's ( 1998 ) approaches . 
The quality of the Markov clustering depends strongly on several parameters such as a granularity factor and the size of the local graph . 
We then determined the WordNet sunsets which most adequately characterized the sense clusters . 
Automatic word sense discovery has applications of many kinds . 
The family of such algorithms is described in ( Widdows , 2003 ) . 
In our simple model based on noun co-occurrences in lists , step 5 corresponds to rebuilding the graph under the restriction that the nodes in the new graph not co-occur ( or at least not very often ) with any of the cluster members already extracted . 
The process is stopped if the similarity between w and its best neighbor under the reduced set of features is below a fixed threshold . 
Section 3 describes the way we divide graphs surrounding ambiguous words into different areas corresponding to different senses , using Markov clustering ( van Dongen , 2000 ) . 
Compute a small local graph Gw around w using the set of features F. If the similarity between w and its closest neighbor is below a fixed threshold go to 6 . 
Following Lin 's work ( 1998 ) , we are currently investigating a graph with verb-object , verb-subject and modifier-noun-collocations from which it is possible to infer more about the senses of systematically polygamous words . 
Output the list of class-labels which best represent the different senses of w in the corpus . 
However , if we remove the mouse-node from its local graph illustrated in figure 1 , the graph decomposes into two parts , one representing the electronic device meaning of mouse and the other one representing its animal sense . 
In section 2 , we present the graph model from which we discover word senses . 
Discovering Corpus-Specific Word Senses
Eventually , flow between dense regions will disappear , the matrix of transition probability TGÂ„ will converge and the limiting matrix can be interpreted as a clustering of the graph .
