We believe that decision trees meet these criteria . 
A preliminary version of this paper appears in ( Pedersen , 2001 ) . 
Each sense { tagged occurrence of an ambiguous word is converted into a feature vector , where each feature represents some property of the surrounding text that is considered to be relevant to the disambiguation process . 
Rather , we will search for bi grams where the component words may be separated by other words in the text . 
These typically include the part { of { speech of surrounding words , the presence of certain key words within some window of context , and various syntactic properties of the sentence and the ambiguous word . 
Then the decision tree learning algorithm is described , as are some benchmark learning algorithms that are included for purposes of comparison . 
However , ( Cressie and Read , 1984 ) suggest that there are cases where Pearson 's statistic is more reliable than the likelihood ratio and that one test should not always be preferred over the other . 
Decision Tree have been used in supervised learning approaches to Word Sense disambiguation , and have fared well in a number of comparative studies ( e.g . , ( Mooney , 1996 ) , ( Pedersen and Bruce , 1997 ) ) .
