Chance performance in all experiments is therefore 50 % . 
Related computational tasks beyond DA classification and speech recognition have received even less attention to date . 
Previous research on DA modeling has generally focused on task-oriented dialog with three tasks in particular garnering much of the research effort . 
We have developed an integrated probabilistic approach to dialog act modeling for conversational speech , and tested it on a large speech corpus . 
Second , we included an `` oracle LM , '' i.e. , always using the LM that corresponds to the hand-labeled DA for each utterance . 
It is known that certain cue words and phrases ( Hirschberg and Litman 1993 ) can serve as explicit indicators of discourse structure . 
Prior and related work is summarized in Section 7 . 
We also investigated non-n-gram discourse models , based on various language modeling techniques known from speech recognition .
