Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying . 
Ordinary FSs used in unification-based grammar formalisms such as PAT ] . { [ Shieher 851 arc classified into two classes , namely , atomic leSs and complex FSs . 
Section 3 explains a TFS unification method based on Wroblewski 's method and then explains the problem with his method . 
A unification example is shown in Fig . 
Several FS unification methods were proposed in IKarttunen 86 , Ferreira 85 , Wroblewski 871 . 
Moreover , data can be accessed in a constant order time relative to the number of DG nodes and need not be reconstructed because this method does not use a data structure consist ing of , ' ; skeleton and environments as does Pereira 's method . 
This method achieves structure sharing by introducing lazy copying to Wroblewski 's incremental copy graph unification method . 
Ile proposed an incremental copy graph unification method to avoid over copying and early copying . 
Complex FSs can have complex FSs as their feature values and can share certain values among features . 
For example , a spoken Present . 
In this paper , some of the efficiency of the procedure- based system is introduced into an FS unification-based system . 
Previous research identified DG copying as a significant overhead . 
Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification
Ferreira structure sharing FS unification method can avoid this problem . 
In Wroblewski 's method , copying unique label arc values whole in order to treat cases like ] Pig . 
The SING Unification methods uses this failure tendencies information .
