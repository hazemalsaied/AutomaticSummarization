The Troll system , which is based on this idea , effectively implements type resolution . 
Consider again the encoding of p and the feature structure 9~ . 
By contrast , the Troll system described in this paper has an effective algorithm f < > r deciding well-formedness , which is based on the idea of efficiently representing disjunctive possibilities within the feature structure , Call a well-typed feature structure in which all nodes are labeled with species a resolved feature structure and call a set of resolved feature structures that have the same underlying graph ( that is , they differ only in their node labellings ) a disjunctive resolved feature structure .
