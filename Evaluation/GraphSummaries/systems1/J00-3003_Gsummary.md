Given all available evidence E about a conversation , the goal is to find the DA sequence U that has the highest posterior probability P ( UIE ) given that evidence . 
Further research within this framework can be characterized by which of these simplifications are addressed . 
The latter can then be leveraged for more accurate speech recognition . 
We also touch briefly on alternative machine learning models for prosodic features . 
The more frequent DA types are briefly characterized below . 
Questions were of several types . 
1 % What did you wear to work today ? 
The language model weight , ~ compensates for acoustic score variances that are effectively too large due to severe independence assumptions in the recognizer acoustic model . 
Table 9 Combined utterance classification accuracies ( chance = 35 % ) . 
The benefit of DA Modeling might therefore be more pronounced on corpus with more even DA distributions , as is typically the cases for task-oriented dialogged .
