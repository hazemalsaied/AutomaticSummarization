An intuitive interpretation of the stationary distribution can be under- 917 stood by the concept of a random walk on the graph representation of the Markov chain.With probability d , a transition is made from the current node ( sentence ) to the nodes that are similar to the query . 
In ( Erkan and Radev , 2004 ) , we introduce method and successfully applied it generic multi-document summarization . 
Given this observation , we experimented with two mixed strategies , in which the number of content words in a question determined whether LexRank or the baseline system was used for sentence retrieval . 
3.4 Experiments with topic-sensitive LexRank . 
Since we are interested in a passage retrieval mechanism that sentences relevant to a given question , providing input to the question answering component of our system , the improvement in average TRDR score is very promising . 
Newstracker clusters were collected automatically by our Web-based news summarization system . 
Using Random Walks for Question-focused Sentence Retrieval
While the last two sentences do not provide answers according to our judges , they do provide context information about the situation . 
3.1 The LexRank method . 
In the context of answering questions from complex stories , where there is often more than one correct answer to a question , and where answers are typically time-dependent , should focus on maximizing TRDR , which gives us 2For clusters annotated by two judges , all sentences chosen by at least one judge were included . 
While Evaluation of question answering systems are often based on a shorter list of ranked Sentence we chose to generate longer lists for several reasons .
