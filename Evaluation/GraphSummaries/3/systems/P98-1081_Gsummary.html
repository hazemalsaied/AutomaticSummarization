<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Component taggers In 1992 , van Halteren combined a number of taggers by way of a straightforward majority vote ( cf . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Also of note is the improvement yielded by the best combination . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our experiment shows that , at least for the task at hand , combination of several different systems allows us to raise the performance ceiling for data driven systems . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>When used on Test , the pairwise voting strategy ( TagPair ) clearly outperforms the other voting strategies , 8 but does not yet approach the level where all tying majority votes are handled correctly ( 98.31 % ) . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It ought therefore to be advantageous to step away from the underlying mechanism of voting and to model the situations observed in Tune more closely . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As it turns out all voting systems outperform the best single tagger , E. 7 Also , the best voting system is the one in which the most specific information is used , Precision-Recall . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Since this model has no facilities for handling unknown words , a Memory-Based system ( see below ) is used to propose distributions of potential tags for words not in the lexicon . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It uses a number of word and context features rather similar to system M , and trains a Maximum Entropy model that assigns a weighting parameter to each feature-value and combination of features that is relevant to the estimation of the probability P ( tag [ features ) . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Traditionally , these models were categorized as either rule-based/symbolic or corpus-based/probabilistic . </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>After that , the decisive factor appears to be the difference in language model : T is generally a better combiner than M and R , 12 even though it has the lowest accuracy when operating alone . </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In this paper , we are concerned with the question whether these differences between models can indeed be exploited to yield a data driven model with superior performance . </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This is much easier and can quickly lead to a model which produces results with a reasonably good quality . </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This can be explained by the fact that , in general , hand crafting an explicit model is rather difficult , especially since what is being modeled natural language , is not ( yet ) well- understood . </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>When a data driven method is used , a model is automatically learned from the implicit structure of an annotated training corpus . </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Since the component taggers all used n-gram statistics to model context probabilities and the knowledge representation was hence fundamentally the same in each component , the results were limited . </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>In all Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) systems , we find one or more language models which are used to predict , classify Andros interpret language related observations . </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>A next step is to examine them in pairs . </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Recent work ( e.g . Brill 1992 ) has demonstrated clearly that this categorization is in fact a mix-up of two distinct Categorization systems : on the one hand there is the representation used for the language model ( rules , Markov model , neural net , case base , etc . ) and on the other hand the manner in which the model is constructed ( hand crafted vs. data driven ) . </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Data driven methods appear to be the more popular . </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Other limiting factors are the power of the hard- and software used to implement the learning method and the availability of training material . </a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>A potential loophole is that each type of learning method brings its own inductive bias ' to the task and therefore different methods will tend to produce different errors . </a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Stacked classifiers From the measurements so far it appears that the use of more detailed information leads to a better accuracy improvement . </a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The accuracy measurements for all of them are listed in Table 2 . </a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>First , the combined votes will make the system more robust to the quirks of each learner 's particular bias . </a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>6 The question is how large a vote we allow each tagger . </a>

<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Obviously there is still room for a closer examination of the differences between the combination methods , e.g . the question whether Memory-Based combination would have performed better if we had provided more training data than just Tune , and of the remaining errors , e.g . the effects of inconsistency in the data ( cf . </a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>The first part , called Train , consists of 80 % of the data ( 931062 tokens ) , constructed 3Ditto tags are used for the components of multi- token units , e.g . if `` as well as '' is taken to be a coordination conjunction , it is tagged `` as_CC1 well_CC2 as_CC3 '' , using three related but different ditto tags . </a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>In the basic version ( Tags ) , each case consists of the tags suggested by the component taggers and the correct tag . </a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Its tagging , which was manually checked and corrected , is generally accepted to be quite accurate . </a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>First of all , tagging is a widely researched and well-understood task ( cf . </a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>The pairwise voting system , using all four individual taggers , scores 97.92 % correct on Test , a 19.1 % reduction in error rate over the best individual system , viz . </a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>Pairwise Voting So far , we have only used information on the performance of individual taggers . </a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>Simple Voting There are many ways in which the results of the component taggers can be combined , selecting a single tag from the set proposed by these taggers . </a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>The most democratic option is to give each tagger one vote ( Majority ) . </a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>5 The most straightforward selection method is an n-way vote . </a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>9 The explanation for this can be found when we examine the differences within the Memory- Based general strategy : the more feature information is stored , the higher the accuracy on Tune , but the lower the accuracy on Test . </a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>Unfortunately , the quality that can be reached for a given task is limited , and not merely by the potential of the learning method used . </a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Also , the use of information about each individual method 's behavior in principle even admits the possibility to fix collective errors . </a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>To see whether this is in fact a good way to spend the extra data , we also trained the two best individual systems ( E and M , with exactly the same settings as in the first experiments ) on a concatenation of Train and Tune , so that they had access to every piece of data that the combination had seen . </a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>It has been shown that , when the errors are uncorrelated to a sufficient degree , the resulting combined classifier will often perform better than all the individual systems ( Ali and Pazzani 1996 ; Chan and Stolfo 1995 ; Tumer and Gosh 1996 ) . </a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>The quality of the individual taggers cf . </a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>The relation between the accuracy of combinations ( using TagPair ) and that of the individual taggers is shown in Table 3 . </a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>It turns out that the increase in the individual taggers is quite limited when compared to combination . </a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>If a tag pair T1T2 has never been observed in Tune , we fall back on information on the individual taggers , viz . </a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>Table 2 : Accuracy of individual taggers and combination methods . </a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>The data in Train ( for individual taggers and Tune ( for combination taggers is to be the only information used in tagger construction : all components of all taggers lexicon , context statistics , etc . ) are to be entirely data driven and no manual adjustments are to be done . </a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49>In order to see whether combination of the component taggers is likely to lead to improvements of tagging quality , we first examine the results of the individual taggers when applied to Tune . </a>
<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50>As far as we know this is also one of the first rigorous measurements of the relative quality of different tagger generators , using a single tagger and dataset and identical circumstances . </a>
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51>the Maximum Entropy tagger ( 97.43 % ) . </a>
<a name="52">[52]</a> <a href="#52" id=52>Here we use a slight adaptation of the tagger . </a>
<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53>But we have even more information on how well the taggers perform . </a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54>However , it appears more useful to give more weight to taggers which have proved their quality . </a>
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55>All Taggers Correct 92.49 Majority Correct ( 31,211 ) 4.34 Correct Present , No Majority 1.37 ( 22,1111 ) Minority Correct ( 13,121 ) 1.01 All Taggers Wrong 0.78 Table 1 : Tagger agreement on Tune . </a>
<a name="56">[56]</a> <a href="#56" id=56>The information about each tagger 's quality is derived from an inspection of its results on Tune . </a>
<a name="57">[57]</a> <a href="#57" id=57>The fourth and final system is the MXPOST system as described by Ratnaparkhi ( 19962 ; henceforth tagger E , for Entropy ) . </a>
<a name="58">[58]</a> <a href="#58" id=58>1° Because C5.0 prunes the decision tree , the over fitting of training material ( Tune ) is less than with Memory-Based learning , but the results on Test are also worse . </a>
<a name="59">[59]</a> <a href="#59" id=59>To examine if the overstraining effects are specific to this particular second level classifier , we also used the C5.0 system , a commercial version of the well-known program C4.5 ( Quinlan 1993 ) for the induction of decision trees , on the same training material . </a>
<a name="60">[60]</a> <a href="#60" id=60>The reasons for this choice are several . </a>
<a name="61">[61]</a> <a href="#61" id=61>This might be explained by the fact that recall information is missing ( for overall performance this does not matter , since recall is equal to precision ) . </a>
<a name="62">[62]</a> <a href="#62" id=62>The third and final part , Test , consists of the remaining 10 % ( .115101 tokens ) and is used for the final performance measurements of all taggers . </a>
<a name="63">[63]</a> <a href="#63" id=63>Second , current performance levels on this task still leave room for improvement : state of the art ' performance for data driven automatic word class taggers ( tagging English text with single tags from a low detail tagger is 9697 % correctly tagged words . </a>
<a name="64">[64]</a> <a href="#64" id=64>The first and oldest system uses a traditional trig-ram model ( Steetskamp 1995 ; henceforth tagger T , for Trigrams ) , based on context statistics P ( ti [ ti-l , ti-2 ) and lexical statistics P ( Tildi directly estimated from relative corpus frequencies . </a>
<a name="65">[65]</a> <a href="#65" id=65>The second part , Tune , consists of 10 % of the data ( every ninth utterance , 114479 tokens ) and is used to select the best tagger parameters where applicable and to develop the combination methods . </a>
<a name="66">[66]</a> <a href="#66" id=66>As explained above , for combination to lead to improvement , the component taggers must differ in the errors that they make . </a>
<a name="67">[67]</a> <a href="#67" id=67>When combining the taggers , every tagger pair is taken in turn and allowed to vote ( with the probability described above ) for each possible tag , i.e . not just the ones suggested by the component taggers . </a>
<a name="68">[68]</a> <a href="#68" id=68>Regardless of such closer investigation , we feel that our results are encouraging enough to extend our investigation of combination , starting with additional component taggers and selection strategies , and going on to shifts to other taggers languages . </a>
<a name="69">[69]</a> <a href="#69" id=69>Note that with this method ( and those in the next section ) a tag suggested by a minority ( or even none ) of the taggers still has a chance to win . </a>
<a name="70">[70]</a> <a href="#70" id=70>This information can be used by forcing each tagger also to add to the vote for tags suggested by the opposition , by an amount equal to 1 minus the recall on the opposing tag ( Precision-Recall ) . </a>
<a name="71">[71]</a> <a href="#71" id=71>In the more advanced versions we also add information about the word in question ( Tags+Word ) and the tags suggested by all taggers for the previous and the next position ( Tags+Context ) . </a>
<a name="72">[72]</a> <a href="#72" id=72>We can investigate all situations where one tagger suggests T1 and the other T2 and estimate the probability that in this situation the tag should actually be Tx . </a>
<a name="73">[73]</a> <a href="#73" id=73>9Tags ( Memory-Based ) scores significantly worse than TagPair ( p=0.0274 and not significantly better than Precision-Recall ( p=0.2766 . </a>
<a name="74">[74]</a> <a href="#74" id=74>7Even the worst combinator , Majority , is significantly better than E : using McNemar 's chi-square , p -- 0 . </a>
<a name="75">[75]</a> <a href="#75" id=75>12Although not significantly better , e.g . the differences within the group ME/ER/ET are not significant . </a>
<a name="76">[76]</a> <a href="#76" id=76>The practice of feeding the outputs of a number of classifiers as features for a next learner sit is significantly better than the runner-up ( Precision-Recall ) with p=0 . </a>
<a name="77">[77]</a> <a href="#77" id=77>We accept that we are measuring quality in relation to a specific Tagging rather than the linguistic truth ( if such exists ) and can only hope the tagged LOB corpus lives up to its reputation . </a></body>
