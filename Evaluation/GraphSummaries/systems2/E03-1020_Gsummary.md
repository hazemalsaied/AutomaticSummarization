We used the simple graph model based on co-occurrences of nouns in lists ( cf . 
In contrast to pure Markov clustering , we do n't try to find a complete clustering of G into senses at once . 
To detect the different areas of meaning in our local graphs , we use a cluster algorithm for graphs ( Markov clustering , MCL ) developed by van Dongen ( 2000 ) .

On the other hand , if the local graph is too big , we will get a lot of noise . 
We then recompute the local graph Gw by discriminating against c 's features . 
If the local graph handed over to the MCL process is small , we might miss some of w 's meaning in the corpus .
