The work described here also makes use of a hidden Markov model . 
The `` augmented network '' uniquely models all second-order dependencies of the type determiner -noun - X , and determiner -adjective -X ( X ranges over { cl ... cn } ) . 
Equivalence classes { Eqvl ... Eqvm } replace the words { wl ... Wv } ( m < < v ) and P ( Eqvi I Ci ) replace the parameters P ( Wi I Ci ) . 
This leaves 50 % of the corpus for training all the other equivalence classes . 
The replacement of the auxiliary category by the following categories greatly improved this : Category Name Words included in Category Be be Been been Being being Have have Have* has , have , had , having be* is , am , are , was , were do* do , does , did modal Modal auxiliaries Unique Equivalence Classes for Common Words Common words occur often enough to be estimated reliably . 
In this regard , Word equivalence classes were used ( Kupiec , 1989 ) .
