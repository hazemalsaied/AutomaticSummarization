Given a set of finite parse trees wl , w2 ... .. w , , the maximum-likelihood estimator for p ( see Section 2 ) is , sensibly enough , the `` relative frequency '' estimator y'~nlf A ~ AA ; wi ) ~i=1 f ( A ~ AA ; wi ) + f ( A ~ a ; wi ) ] where f ( . ; w ) is the number of occurrences of the production `` . '' in the tree w. The sentence a m , although ambiguous ( there are multiple parses when m > 2 ) , always involves m - 1 of the A ~ AA productions and m of the A ~ a productions . 
Furthermore , CFG 's are readily fit with a probability distribution ( to make probabilistic CFG 's -- or PCFG 's ) , rendering them suitable for ambiguous languages through the maximum a posteriori rule of choosing the most probable parse . 
Context-free grammars ( CFG 's ) are useful because of their relatively broad coverage and because of the availability of efficient parsing algorithms . 
More generally , let G -- ( V , T , R , S ) denote a context-free grammar with finite variable set V , start symbol S E V , finite terminal set T , and finite production ( or rule ) set R . 
What if the production probabilities are estimated from data ? 
For example , there is a simple maximum-likelihood prescription for estimating the production probabilities from a corpus of trees ( see Section 2 ) , resulting in a PCFG . 
It is reasonable to hope that if the trees in the sample are finite , then an estimate of production probabilities based upon the sample will produce a system that assigns probability zero to the set of infinite trees . 
It is not hard to show that Sh is nondecreasing and converges to min ( 1 , I ) , meaning that a proper probability is obtained if and only if p < ~ . 
In the simple example here , the estimator converges in one step and is the same ~ as if we had observed the entire parse tree for each wi .
