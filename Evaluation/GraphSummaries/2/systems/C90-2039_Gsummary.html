<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This method achieves structure sharing by introducing lazy copying to Wroblewski 's incremental copy graph unification method . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Ile proposed an incremental copy graph unification method to avoid over copying and early copying . </a>
