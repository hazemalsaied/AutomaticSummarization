<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In ( Erkan and Radev , 2004 ) , we introduce method and successfully applied it generic multi-document summarization . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>and sentence numbers of the top 20 sentences . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While evaluations of question answering systems are often based on a shorter list of ranked sentences we chose to generate longer lists for several reasons . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the new approach , the 916 score of a sentence is determined by a mixture model of the relevance of the sentence to the query and the similarity of the sentence to other high-scoring sentences . </a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Recent work has motivated the need for systems that support Information Synthesis tasks , in which user seeks a global understanding of a topic story Amigo et al. , 2004 ) . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As previously mentioned , the original LexRank method performed welling the context of generic summarization . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We presented topic-sensitive LexRank and applied it to the problem of sentence retrieval . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>While the last two sentences do not provide answers according to our judges , they do provide context information about the situation . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>As discussed in Section 2 , our goal wast develop a topic-sensitive version of LexRank and to use it to improve a baseline systems , which previously been used successfully for query-basedsentence Retrieval ( Allan et al . , 2003 ) . </a></body>
