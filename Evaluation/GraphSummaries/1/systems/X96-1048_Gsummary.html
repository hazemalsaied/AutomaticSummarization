<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Any participant in a future MUC evaluation faces the challenge of providing a named entity identification capability that would score in the 90th percentile on the F-measure on a task such as the MUC6 one . </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The other two tasks , Template Element and Scenario Template , were information extraction tasks that followed on from the MUC evaluations conducted in previous years . </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The latest in a series of natural language processing system evaluations was concluded in October 1995 and was the topic of the Sixth Message Understanding Conference ( MUC6 ) in November . </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some work on expanding the scope of the NE task has been carried out in the context of a foreign- language NE evaluation conducted in the spring of 1996 . </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The changes occurred only in performance on identifying organizations . </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Whereas the Text Filter row in the score report shows the system 's ability to do text filtering ( document detection ) , the All Objects row and the individual Slot rows show the system 's ability to do information extraction . </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As indicated in table 2 , all systems performed better on identifying person names than on identifying organization or location names , and all but a few systems performed better on location names than on organization names . </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The amount of agreement between the two annotators was found to be 80 % recall and 82 % precision . </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>At the top level is the TEMPLATE object , of which there is one instantiated for every document . </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It was also unexpected that one of the systems would match human performance on the task . </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>common organization names , first names of people , and location names can be handled by recourse to list lookup , although there are drawbacks : some names may be on more than one list , the lists will not be complete and may not match the names as it is realized in the texts ( e.g . , may not cover the needed abbreviated form of an organization names , may not cover the complete person names ) , etc.. </a></body>
